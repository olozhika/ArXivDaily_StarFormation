 - **Abstract**
 While significant advances have been made in photometric classification ahead of the millions of transient events and hundreds of supernovae (SNe) each night that the Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) will discover, classifying SNe spectroscopically remains the best way to determine most subtypes of SNe. Traditional spectrum classification tools use template matching techniques (Blondin & Tonry 2007) and require significant human supervision. Two deep learning spectral classifiers, DASH (Muthukrishna et al. 2019) and SNIascore (Fremling et al. 2021) define the state of the art, but SNIascore is a binary classifier devoted to maximizing the purity of the SN Ia-norm sample, while DASH is no longer maintained and the original work suffers from contamination of multi-epoch spectra in the training and test sets. We have explored several neural network architectures in order to create a new automated method for classifying SN subtypes, settling on an attention-based model we call ABC-SN. We benchmark our results against an updated version of DASH, thus providing the community with an up-to-date general purpose SN classifier. Our dataset includes ten different SN subtypes including subtypes of SN Ia, core collapse and interacting SNe. We find that ABC-SN outperforms DASH, and we discuss the possibility that modern SN spectra datasets contain label noise which limit the performance of all classifiers.
#### Probing Turbulence, Gravity, Supernovae, and Magnetic Field Effects with the 6D Kinematics of Young Stars in Milky Way Star-Forming Regions

 - **Abstract**
 The dynamics of star forming gas can be affected by many physical processes, such as turbulence, gravity, supernova explosions, and magnetic fields. In this paper, we investigate several nearby star forming regions (Orion, Upper Sco, Taurus, and Perseus) for kinematic imprints of these influences on the newly formed stars. Using Gaia DR3 astrometry and APOGEE DR17 radial velocities, we compute first-order velocity structure functions (VSFs) of young stars in galactic Cartesian coordinates in both 6D (3D positions and 3D velocities) and 4D (3D positions and each 1D velocity) to identify signatures of turbulence and anisotropic motion. We also construct 3D and 1D radial velocity profiles to identify coherent expansion trends, and compare stellar proper motions to plane-of-sky magnetic field orientations in Taurus and Perseus. We find that the VSFs are mildly anisotropic, with slightly different amplitudes, slopes, or features in different directions in several groups, but in general, they are all consistent with Larson's Relation at intermediate length scales, especially in less compact groups. In several cases, the VSFs exhibit features suggestive of local energy injection from supernovae. Radial velocity profiles reveal clear anisotropic expansion in multiple groups, with the most extreme cases corresponding to those with the most anisotropic VSFs. In Perseus, we find that the motions of young stars are preferentially perpendicular to the local magnetic field. We find multiple, overlapping causes in each group for the observed kinematics. Our findings support that young stars remember more than just the turbulent state of their natal clouds.
#### Inferring and Interpreting the Visual Geometric Albedo and Phase Function of Earth

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding reflectance-related quantities for worlds enables effective comparative planetology and strengthens mission planning and execution. Measurements of these properties for Earth, especially its geometric albedo and phase function, have been difficult to achieve due to our Terrestrial situation -- it is challenging to obtain planetary-scale brightness measurements for the world we stand on. Using a curated dataset of visual phase-dependent, disk-averaged observations of Earth taken from the ground and spacecraft, alongside a physical-statistical model, this work arrives at a definitive value for the visual geometric albedo of our planet: 0.242 (+0.005/-0.004). This albedo constraint is up 30--40% smaller than earlier, widely-quoted values. The physical-statistical model enables retrieval-like inferences to be performed on phase curves, and includes contributions from optically thick clouds, optically thin aerosols, Rayleigh scattering, ocean glint, gas absorption, and Lambertian surface reflectance. Detailed application of this inverse model to Earth's phase curve quantifies contributions of these different processes to the phase-dependent brightness of the Pale Blue Dot. Model selection identifies a scenario where aerosol forward scattering results in a false negative for surface habitability detection. Observations of phase curves for Earth at redder-optical or near-infrared wavelengths could disentangle ocean glint effects from aerosol forward scattering and would help with understanding the utility of phase curve observations for the under-development Habitable Worlds Observatory.
#### Differential Corrections Algorithm for Initial Orbit Determination in the Cislunar Region using Angle-Only Measurements

 - **Abstract**
 As space traffic continues to increase in the cislunar region, accurately determining the trajectories of objects operating within this domain becomes critical. However, due to the combined gravitational influences of the Earth and Moon, orbital dynamics in this region are highly nonlinear and often exhibit chaotic behavior, posing significant challenges for trajectory determination. Many existing methods attempt to address this complexity using machine learning models, advanced optimization techniques, or sensors that directly measure distance to the target, approaches that often increase computational burden and system complexity. This work presents a novel initial orbit determination (IOD) algorithm for cislunar objects based solely on three angle-only measurements taken at three discrete times. The core methodology builds upon a differential corrections framework which iteratively refines the target's trajectory to satisfy line-of-sight constraints. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the algorithm enables accurate IOD using minimal observational data, making it particularly suited for onboard implementation in resource-constrained cislunar missions.

 - **Abstract**
 When dense cores in molecular clouds or filamentary structures collapse and form protostars, they may undergo fragmentation and form binary or multiple systems. In this paper, we investigated the key mechanisms influencing fragmentation by comparing the physical conditions of fragmented and unfragmented dense cores (~0.1 pc) in Orion A. Utilizing archival submillimeter continuum data from the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT) and the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array survey of Class 0 and I protostars at a 0.''1 resolution, we identified 38 dense cores hosting single protostars and 15 cores hosting binary or multiple systems. We measured the dense cores properties with the Herschel dust temperature, Nobeyama 45m N$_2$H$^+$ J=1-0, and JCMT polarization data. Our results reveal that the dense cores hosting binary/multiple systems exhibit significantly higher density and Mach number compared to those hosting single protostars, while there are no correlations between the occurrence of fragmentation and the energy ratios of turbulence and magnetic field to gravity. Our results suggest that the higher density and supersonic turbulence of the dense cores can lead to local collapse and fragmentation to form binary/multiple systems, while the magnetic field has limited influence on fragmentation in the dense cores in Orion A.

 - **Abstract**
 Molecular emission is a powerful tool for studying the physical and chemical structures of dense cores. The distribution and abundance of different molecules provide information on the chemical composition and physical properties in these cores. We study the chemical segregation of three molecules (c-C$_3$H$_2$, CH$_3$OH, CH$_3$CCH) in the starless cores B68 and L1521E, and the prestellar core L1544. We applied the density-based clustering algorithms DBSCAN and HDBSCAN to identify chemical and physical structures within these cores. To enable cross-core comparisons, the input samples were characterised based on their physical environment, discarding the 2D spatial information. The clustering analysis showed significant chemical differentiation across the cores, successfully reproducing the known molecular segregation of c-C$_3$H$_2$ and CH$_3$OH in all three cores. Furthermore, it identifies a segregation between c-C$_3$H$_2$ and CH$_3$CCH, which is not apparent from the emission maps. Key features driving the clustering are integrated intensity, velocity offset, H$_2$ column density, and H$_2$ column density gradient. Different environmental conditions are reflected in the variations in the feature relevance across the cores. This study shows that density-based clustering provides valuable insights into chemical and physical structures of starless cores. It demonstrates that already small datasets of two or three molecules can yield meaningful results. This new approach revealed similarities in the clustering patterns of CH$_3$OH and CH$_3$CCH relative to c-C$_3$H$_2$, suggesting that c-C$_3$H$_2$ traces regions of lower density than to the other two molecules. This allowed for insight into the CH$_3$CCH peak in L1544, which appears to trace a landing point of chemically fresh gas that is accreted to the core, highlighting the impact of accretion processes on molecular distributions.
#### Can a convecting magma ocean offer a solution to the puzzling case of core convection in early earth?

 - **Abstract**
 Convective flow in Earth's iron-rich liquid core drives self-sustained dynamo action, generating Earth's magnetic field, which is strongest among all terrestrial planets of the solar system. Rock records show that this magnetic field has been operative in Earth for at least 3.4 billion years (b.y). However, advanced high pressure experiments have revised the value of the thermal conductivity of the outer core, which implies an age for the inner core of less than 1 b.y., when compositional convection begins. This creates a puzzle, with a gap between the observations of an early magnetic field on Earth and the young inner core. Previous work has suggested that the pre-inner core dynamo could have been generated in a magma ocean (MO) at the base of the mantle; however, the fluid dynamics of this scenario have received little attention. Here we numerically model the non-magnetic rotating flow in a MO above a convectively stable core in a configuration representing the pre-inner core days of Earth's evolution. Simulations here explore the importance of several dimensionless parameters on coupled core-MO convection -- the Rayleigh number, the ocean/core thermal diffusivity ratio, thermal expansion coefficient ratio, viscosity ratio, and layer thickness ratio. It is found that the MO can easily drive a flow of comparable magnitude in the core, and an approximately linear relationship is observed between the ratio of root-mean-square velocities in the core and the ocean, $(u_c^{RMS}/u_o^{RMS})$, and $(\Nu_o-1)$, where $\Nu_o$ is the Nusselt number for the MO, for the $\Nu_o$ of order 1 to 10 considered. Radial and azimuthal components of the core flow are of similar magnitude, so that, with comparable toroidal and poloidal components, we speculate that the MO-driven core flow could drive an early dynamo.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a scenario that could explain non-thermal particle acceleration in relativistic quasi-perpendicular electron-positron shocks, such as the termination shock of pulsar wind nebulae. The shock produces a strong electromagnetic precursor that propagates into the upstream plasma, which is initially threaded by a uniform background magnetic field. We show that the filamentation instability breaks the precursor into radiation filaments parallel to the shock normal. The transverse scale of the filaments is of the order of a few plasma skin depths. In the shock frame, the bulk Lorentz factor of the upstream plasma is significantly reduced inside the radiation filaments. Then, the instability produces a relativistic shear flow with strong velocity gradients on kinetic scales. The velocity gradients distort the background magnetic field lines, and generate a magnetic field component parallel to the shock normal that reverses across each radiation filament, a configuration that could trigger magnetic reconnection in the upstream plasma. These effects may accelerate particles before the plasma enters the shock.
#### V Sge: Supersoft Source or Exotic Hot Binary? I. An X-Shooter campaign in the high state

 - **Abstract**
 V Sge is a peculiar, highly luminous long-period (12.34h) binary star that can display a super-soft X-ray emitting component when in the faint phase of its V~ 10-13mag variability range. Apparently undergoing Eddington-limited accretion from its more massive secondary, it is in a very rare, short-lived evolutionary phase towards the double degenerate channel. Its complex and highly variable optical emission features, from Balmer and Heii to high-ionisation lines, including strong fluorescence features, have been challenging to interpret, especially given the absence of any absorption lines associated with photospheric features from either stellar component. With the detailed properties of V Sge, especially the donor, still controversial, we undertook a VLT/X-Shooter campaign over three months in 2023, obtaining high S/N, high resolution spectra that revealed multiple components in both high- and low-ionisation lines. This allows us to track V Sge's principal emitting regions via Doppler tomography, obtaining new insights into high accretion-rate dynamics. In particular, we identify a stationary, double-peaked emission core which we interpret as a circumbinary ring, analogous to SS433. This enables us to derive limits on the system masses. Furthermore, we find very broad emission-line wings whose mean velocity can vary over hundreds of kilometres per second on timescales of decades, yet ``flip'' between states in <1 week. We show that the super-soft X-ray source interpretation is able to account for these and other observational attributes significantly better than the hot binary model, concluding that V Sge could be one of the brightest known Galactic super-soft sources.

 - **Abstract**
 We propose a model for dust formation in Type II supernovae (SNe) interacting with confined circumstellar material (CSM), motivated by recent time-domain surveys that have revealed a substantial fraction of SN progenitors to be surrounded by CSM ejected shortly before core-collapse. We simulate the pre-SN mass eruption and the resulting confined CSM using the open-source code CHIPS, and follow the subsequent evolution of the SN ejecta and its interaction with the CSM. We show that a cold dense shell (CDS) is formed at the radiative shock under a wide range of conditions and later undergoes rapid adiabatic cooling during free expansion, leading to efficient dust condensation. The resulting dust mass ranges from $\sim10^{-3}\,M_\odot$ to $0.1\,M_\odot$, depending on the mass and spatial extent of the CSM. We further calculate the infrared (IR) emission from the newly formed dust and find broad consistency with observations of SN~1998S. Notably, the IR light curve exhibits a rapid rise within $\lesssim10\,{\rm d}$, closely resembling that of kilonovae (KNe). This suggests that dust emission powered by confined CSM interaction may be also discovered in KN searches. Moreover, the high-density environment of the CDS may allow dust grains to grow to larger sizes, enhancing their survivability against destruction by reverse shocks propagating from the interstellar medium at later times.
#### The nebular phase of SN 2024ggi: a low-mass progenitor with no signs of interaction

 - **Abstract**
 Context: SN 2024ggi is a Type II supernova (SN) discovered in the nearby galaxy NGC 3621 (D $\approx6.7\pm0.d$ Mpc) on 2024 April 03.21 UT. Its proximity enabled a detailed investigation of the SN's properties and its progenitor star. This work focuses on the optical evolution of SN 2024ggi at the nebular phase. Aims: We investigate the progenitor properties and possible asymmetries in the ejecta by studying the nebular phase evolution between days 287 and 400 after the explosion. Methods: We present optical photometry and spectroscopy of SN 2024ggi during the nebular phase, obtained with the Las Campanas and Gemini South Observatories. Four nebular spectra were taken at 287, 288, 360, and 396 days post-explosion, supplemented by late-time $uBVgri$-band photometry spanning $320-400$ days. The analysis of the nebular emission features is performed to probe ejecta asymmetries. Based on the [O I] flux and [O I]/[Ca II] ratio, and comparisons with spectra models from the literature, we arrive to an estimate of the progenitor mass. Additionally, we construct the bolometric light curve from optical photometry and near-infrared data to derive the synthesized nickel mass. Results: Our analysis suggests a progenitor zero-age-main-sequence mass between $12-15 M_\odot$. The late-time bolometric light curve is consistent with a synthesized $^{56}$Ni mass of $0.05-0.06 M_\odot$. The line profiles exhibit only minor changes over the observed period and suggest a roughly symmetrical ejecta, with a possible clump of oxygen-rich material moving towards the observer. No signatures of circumstellar material interaction are detected up to 400 days after the explosion.
#### Extended multi-phase gas reservoirs in the z=4.3 protocluster SPT2349-56: non-stellar ionisation sources?

 - **Abstract**
 We aim to characterize the multi-phase gas in the SPT2349-56 protocluster at z=4.3, known to host one of the most starbursting and AGN-rich high redshift this http URL this purpose we conducted APEX single dish observations of the [CII]158 micron (hereafter [CII]) line towards the Core and North components, previously imaged with the ALMA 12-m array. We also present the first [OIII]88 micron (hereafter [OIII]) line observations in such high redshift protocluster system. We obtain a [CII] line luminosity $\sim$1.7$\times$ more than the one recovered by ALMA towards the Core, while remarkably we recover 4$\times$ more [CII] line emission than the one found in deep ALMA images towards the North component, suggesting that the most massive gas reservoirs lie in the less extreme regions of this protocluster system. A minimum ionised gas mass of $\mathrm M_{\rm min}(H^+)$$ \sim$$3.7\times 10^{10}$\,\Msun\, is deduced from the [OIII] line, amounting to 30\% of the molecular gas mass in the same area. Finally we obtain star formation rate (SFR) estimates using the [OIII] line luminosity, and the corresponding ionised gas mass. These yield values that can surpass the far-IR continuum-derived SFR (under the assumption of a standard stellar IMF), which can be reconciled only if non-stellar ionising sources contribute to the [OIII] line luminosity, or a top-heavy stellar IMF produces a larger fraction of O stars per total stellar mass, a distinct possibility in High-Energy-Particle (HEP) rather than (UV-photon)-dominated environments in clusters. Future work using far-IR fine-structure and molecular/neutral-atomic lines is necessary for determining the thermal/ionisation states of the multi-phase medium and these line ratios must be measured over a wide range of spatial scales, which ultimately requires combining wide-field single-dish and high resolution interferometric observations.
#### Identification and photometric classification of extragalactic transients in the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Data Preview 1

 - **Abstract**
 The Vera C. Rubin Observatory will soon survey the southern sky, delivering a depth and sky coverage that is unprecedented in time domain astronomy. As part of commissioning, Data Preview 1 (DP1) has been released. It comprises a ComCam observing campaign between November and December 2024 with multi-band imaging of seven fields, covering roughly 0.4 square degree each, provides a first glimpse into the data products that will become available once the Legacy Survey of Space and Time begins. In this work, we search three fields for extragalactic transients. We identify six new extragalactic transients, and three known ones from a sample of 369,644 difference image analysis objects. Photometric classification using \texttt{Superphot+} indicates that this sample likely comprises six type Ia, two type II, two type Ibc and one type IIn supernovae. Our findings are in slight tension with supernova detection rate predictions from the literature of $12\pm3$ SN Ia and $3\pm1$ core-collapse supernovae likely due to the lack of suitable templates. Nevertheless, this work demonstrates the quality of the data products delivered in DP1 and indicates that Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey and Space and Time (LSST) is well placed to fulfill its discovery potential in time domain astronomy.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the discovery of AT 2024wpp ("Whippet"), a fast and luminous 18cow-like transient. At a redshift of z=0.0868, revealed by Keck Cosmic Web Imager spectroscopy of its faint and diffuse star-forming host, it is the fourth-nearest example of its class to date. Rapid identification of the source in the Zwicky Transient Facility data stream permitted ultraviolet-through-optical observations to be obtained prior to peak, allowing the first determination of the peak bolometric luminosity (2x10^45 erg/s), maximum photospheric radius (10^15 cm), and total radiated energy (10^51 erg) of an 18cow-like object. We present results from a comprehensive multiwavelength observing campaign, including a far-UV spectrum from the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph on the Hubble Space Telescope and deep imaging extending >100 days post-explosion from the Very Large Telescope, Hubble Space Telescope, Very Large Array, and Atacama Large Millimetre Array. We interpret the observations under a model in which a powerful rapidly-accreting central engine blows a fast (~0.15c) wind into the surrounding medium and irradiates it with X-rays. The high Doppler velocities and intense ionization within this wind prevent any identifiable features from appearing in the ejecta or in the surrounding circumstellar material, even in the far-ultraviolet. Weak H and He signatures do emerge in the spectra after 35 days in the form of double-peaked narrow lines. Each peak is individually narrow (full width ~3000 km/s) but the two components are separated by ~6600 km/s, indicating stable structures of denser material, possibly representing streams of tidal ejecta or an ablated companion star.

 - **Abstract**
 With the arrival of JWST observations of the TRAPPIST-1 planets, it is timely to reassess the contribution of tidal heating to their heat budget. JWST thermal phase curves could reveal endogenic heating through an anomalously high nightside temperature, providing an opportunity to estimate tidal heating. In this study, we revisit the tidal heating of these planets and propose a simple method to compute the tidal heating profile across a broad range of parameters. Our approach leverages a known formulation for synchronously rotating planets on low-eccentricity orbits and the fact that the profile shape depends solely on internal structure. We calculate the tidal heating contributions for all T-1 planets, with a particular focus on the impact of internal structure and eccentricity uncertainties on their total heat budget. Although the masses and radii of these planets are well constrained, degeneracies remain in their internal structure and composition. For volatile-poor planets of silicate-rock compositions, we investigate the role of core iron content by exploring a range of core sizes. For each structure, we compute the degree-two gravitational Love number, $k_2$, and the corresponding tidal heating profiles. We assume sub-solidus temperatures profiles that are decoupled from interior heat production, which means our estimates are conservative and likely represent minimum values. We find that the tidal heat flux for T-1b and c can exceed Io's heat flux, with uncertainties primarily driven by eccentricity. These high fluxes may be detectable with JWST. For T-1f to g, the tidal flux remains below Earth's geothermal flux, suggesting that tidal heating is unlikely to be the dominant energy source. For planets d and e, however, tidal heating likely dominates their heat budget, potentially driving intense volcanic and tectonic activity, which could enhance their habitability prospects.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the chemical evolution of a forming molecular cloud behind an interstellar shock wave. We conduct three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamics simulations of the converging flow of atomic gas, including a simple chemical network and tracer particles that move along the local velocity field. Then we perform detailed chemical network calculations along the trajectory of each tracer particle. The diffuse part of forming molecular clouds is CO-poor; i.e., H$_2$ and CO abundances do not correlate. In diffuse regions of $n_\mathrm{H}\lesssim 10^{3}\,\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$, we find that the abundances of hydrocarbons and oxygen-bearing molecules are determined by steady-state chemistry reflecting the local H$_2$ abundance, which is determined by the gas density along the trajectory. In denser regions, the abundances are affected by water ice formation, which changes the elemental abundance of carbon and oxygen (i.e., C/O ratio) in the gas phase. Assuming quasi-steady-state chemistry given the abundances of major molecules (e.g., H$_2$) from the simple network, we derive analytic solutions for molecular abundances, which reproduce the calculation results. We also calculate the molecular column densities based on the spatial distribution of tracer particles and their molecular abundances, and compare them with observations of diffuse molecular clouds. We find that the column densities of CH, CCH, and OH are linearly correlated with those of H$_2$, which supports the empirical relation used in the observations. On the other hand, the column density of HCO$^+$ shows non-linear dependence on the H$_2$ column density, reflecting the difference in HCO$^+$ formation paths in CO-poor and CO-rich regions.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the first {\lambda}2-mm very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) observations of the radio galaxy NGC 1052, conducted with the Korean VLBI Network (KVN) using a wide-band recording mode. Leveraging the wide bandwidth covering a velocity range at 2300 km/s, we successfully detect broad (> 700 km/s) multi-component SO J_N = 3_3 - 2_2 absorption against the sub-parsec-scale continuum structure. The absorption profile consists of both redshifted and blueshifted components, including a newly identified blueshifted feature at -412 km/s relative to the systemic velocity. Significant SO absorption is confined to the central components, with no substantial detection toward the outer jet components. This constrains the location of SO gas to a compact region smaller than 0.45 pc in the sub-parsec vicinity of the supermassive black hole (SMBH). Our results support the scenario in which SO molecules are evaporated through shock heating caused by jet-torus interaction. The SO gas clumps are likely driven outward by the jet, with some returning toward the SMBH as inflowing material. Comparison with 321 GHz H2O masers reveals partial similarities in spatial distribution and radial velocity, suggesting that the jet-torus interaction may also trigger the excitation of H2O masers.

 - **Abstract**
 We conducted experiments with machine learning techniques to construct dust temperature maps from the CO isotopologue molecular line data in the Orion A molecular cloud. In the classical astrophysical methodology, multi-band continuum data are required to derive the dust temperature. The present study aims to investigate the capability and limitations of machine learning techniques to derive dust temperatures in regions without multi-band dust continuum data. We investigated how the number of pixels used for training influences prediction accuracy, and how the dust temperatures sampled in the training area influence prediction accuracy. We found that $\sim$5\% of the total number of pixels in the observational region is sufficient for training to obtain accurate predictions. Furthermore, a dust temperature sample within the training area should cover the whole temperature range and have a similar sample distribution to that of the entire observing region for an accurate prediction. The $^{12}$CO / $^{13}$CO ratio is often found to be the most important feature in predicting the dust temperature. As the $^{12}$CO / $^{13}$CO ratio is a tracer of PDR, the machine learning technique could connect the dust temperatures to the PDRs. We also found that the condition of thermal gas-dust coupling is not required for accurate prediction of the dust temperature from the molecular line data, and that machine learning is capable of capturing information more than classical astrophysical concepts.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. There are only six molecules containing N-O bond that are detected in gaseous phase in interstellar medium. One of those is nitrous oxide (N2O), which was searched for but not found in solid form from as early as Infrared Space Observatory (ISO) mission was launched. The observational capabilities of James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) present a possibility to identify solid interstellar N2O. Aims. We aim to identify nitrous oxide in open JWST spectra of interstellar ices towards a sample of Class 0, 0/I and flat protostars using the relevant laboratory mixtures of N2O-bearing interstellar ice analogues. Methods. A set of laboratory infrared transmission spectra was obtained for the following mixtures: N2O:CO2=1:20, N2O:CO=1:20, N2O:N2=1:20, N2O:CO2:CO=1:15:5, N2O:CO2:N2=1:15:13 at 10-23 K. A search for N2O in JWST NIRSpec spectra towards 50 protostars was performed by fitting the 4.44-4.47 um (2250-2235 cm-1) NN-stretch absorption band with new laboratory mixtures of N2O-bearing ices. Results. We claim the first secure identification of N2O in 16 protostars. The fitting results show that N2O is formed predominantly within the apolar layer of the ice mantles, rich in CO, CO2 and N2. The abundance of solid N2O is estimated as 0.2-2.1% relative to solid CO. We present band strengths for N2O in the mixtures corresponding to the apolar layer. Also, an identification of the C-N stretch band at 4.42 um (2260 cm-1) is reported, which we tentatively assign to HNCO, the simplest C-N bond carrier.

 - **Abstract**
 Observations indicate that disc fragmentation due to Gravitational Instability (GI) is the likely origin of massive companions to stars, such as giant planets orbiting M-dwarf stars, Brown Dwarf (BD) companions to FGK stars, and binary stars with separations smaller than 100 au. Additionally, we have recently showed that disc fragmentation in young rapidly evolving binary systems ejects an abundant population of massive Jupiter-mass Free-Floating Planets (FFPs). In this model, a massive disc around an initially single protostar undergoes GI and hatches a number of fragments; the most massive oligarch grows by runaway accretion into the secondary star. As the system rearranges itself from a single to a binary star configuration, a dramatic "pincer movement" by the binary ejects planets through dynamical interactions with the stars. Here we propose that the same scenario applies to an even more abundant population of smaller FFPs discovered by the microlensing surveys. Although disc fragmentation is usually believed to form only massive objects, several pathways for forming small core-dominated planets at separations of tens of au exist. We present results from three complementary simulation approaches, all of which confirm planet ejection efficiency as high as 0.5 for secondaries more massive than $\sim 10$\% of the primary star mass. On the other hand, Jovian mass planets migrate through the region of tens of au too rapidly to eject planets from that region. We discuss implications of this scenario, concluding that microlensing FFPs may be the most convincing evidence yet that disc fragmentation forms planets much less massive than Jupiter.
#### Short gamma-ray burst progenitors have short delay times

 - **Abstract**
 Short gamma-ray bursts (SGRBs) are thought to be primarily associated with binary neutron star (BNS) mergers. The SGRB population can therefore be scrutinized to look for signatures of the delay time between the formation of the progenitor massive star binary and the eventual merger, which could produce an evolution of the cosmic rate density of such events whose shape departs from that of the cosmic star formation history (CSFH). To that purpose, we study a large sample of SGRBs within a hierarchical Bayesian framework, with a particular focus on the delay time distribution (DTD) of the population. Following previous studies, we model the DTD either as a power-law with a minimum time delay or as a log-normal function. We consider two models for the intrinsic SGRB luminosity distribution: an empirical luminosity function (ELF) with a doubly broken power-law shape, and one based on a quasi-universal structured jet (QUSJ) model. Regardless of the chosen parametrization, we find average time delays $10\lesssim \langle \tau_\mathrm{d}\mathrm\rangle/\mathrm{Myr}\lesssim 800$ and a minimum delay time $\tau_\mathrm{d,min}\lesssim 350\,\mathrm{Myr}$, in contrast with previous studies that found long delay times of few Gyr. We demonstrate that the cause of the longer inferred time delays in past studies most likely resides in an incorrect treatment of selection effects.
#### The uncertainty in water mass fraction of wet planets

 - **Abstract**
 Planets with masses between Earth and Neptune often have radii that imply the presence of volatiles, suggesting that water may be abundant in their interiors. However, directly observing the precise water mass fraction and water distribution remains unfeasible. In our study, we employ an internal structure code MAGRATHEA to model planets with high water content and explore potential interior distributions. Departing from traditional assumptions of a layered structure, we determine water and rock distribution based on water-rock miscibility criteria. We model {wet planets} with an iron core and a homogeneous mixture of rock and water above it. At the outer regions of the planet, the pressure and temperature are below the rock-water miscibility point (the second critical point), causing the segregation of water and rock. Consequently, a shell of water is formed in the outermost layers. By considering the water-rock miscibility and the vapor state of water, our approach highlights the uncertainty in estimating the water mass fraction of detected exoplanets.

 - **Abstract**
 Dynamic Spectrum Sharing (DSS) is increasingly promoted as a key element of modern spectrum policy, driven by the rising demand from commercial wireless systems and advances in spectrum access technologies. Passive radio sciences, including radio astronomy, Earth remote sensing, and meteorology, operate under fundamentally different constraints. They rely on exceptionally low interference spectrum and are highly vulnerable to even brief radio frequency interference. We examine whether DSS can benefit passive services or whether it introduces new failure modes and enforcement challenges. We propose just-in-time quiet zones (JITQZ) as a mechanism for protecting high value observations and assess hybrid frameworks that preserve static protection for core passive bands while allowing constrained dynamic access in adjacent frequencies. We analyze the roles of propagation uncertainty, electromagnetic compatibility constraints, and limited spectrum awareness. Using a game theoretic framework, we show why non-cooperative sharing fails, identify conditions for sustained cooperation, and examine incentive mechanisms including pseudonymetry-enabled attribution that promote compliance. We conclude that DSS can support passive radio sciences only as a high-reliability, safety-critical system. Static allocations remain essential, and dynamic access is viable only with conservative safeguards and enforceable accountability.

 - **Abstract**
 Temperature and luminosity are the two key diagnostics of a star, yet these cannot come directly from survey data, but must be imputed by comparing those data to models. SED fitting offers a high-precision method to obtain both parameters for stars where both their distance and extinction are well known. The recent publication of many all-sky or large-area surveys coincides the publication of parallaxes and 3D extinction cubes from the Gaia satellite, making it possible to perform SED fitting of truly large ($>10^8$) numbers of Galactic stars for the first time. The analysis of this data requires a high level of automation. Here, we describe the ongoing Gaia All-Sky Stellar Parameters Service (GASPS): the fitting of 240 million SEDs from Gaia DR3 and the extraction of temperatures and luminosities for the corresponding stars using the PySSED code. We demonstrate the quality of the initial results, and the promise that these data show, from wavelength-specific information such as the ultraviolet and infrared excess of each star, to stellar classification, to expansion of the project beyond our own Galaxy, and mineralogical mapping of the Milky Way's interstellar medium.
#### Dissecting the dust distribution and polarization around two B213 young stellar objects with ALMA

 - **Abstract**
 The earliest stages of disk formation and dust evolution during the protostellar phase remain poorly constrained. Millimeter dust emission and its polarization provide key insights into the physical processes and material distribution at the envelope-disk interface. We present ALMA polarimetric observations at 1.4 mm and 3 mm of two young stellar objects in Taurus, IRAS 04166+2706 (K04166) and IRAS 04169+2702 (K04169), probing scales from 25 au to 3000 au. We model the Stokes I emission to separate disk and envelope contributions and analyze the polarization properties to identify the dominant polarization mechanisms. K04166 shows extended Stokes I and polarized emission tracing a tentative hourglass magnetic field morphology in its envelope. In the inner envelope and disk (< 100 au), the properties of the polarized emission change, suggesting either a toroidal magnetic field or the presence of large grains. In contrast, K04169 exhibits compact Stokes I and polarized emission consistent with self-scattering from the disk. Both disks are extremely compact, but only K04166 retains a substantial envelope. Our multiscale ALMA polarimetric observations reveal a transition from magnetically aligned grains in envelopes to self-scattering in disks within the transition region of 20-50 au. These results provide important clues on dust grain growth and magnetic field morphology at the disk-envelope scales. Despite being embedded in the same filament, the two sources display striking differences, indicating that K04166 is a young embedded object with a substantial envelope threaded by relatively organized magnetic fields. Meanwhile, K04169 is more evolved, likely to be a young T-Tauri star. However, in both disks, the presence of large grains already suggests a scenario of early dust evolution in disks of the Class 0 stage.
#### Modeling the Effect of C/O Ratio on Complex Carbon Chemistry in Cold Molecular Clouds

 - **Abstract**
 Elemental abundances, which are often depleted with respect to the solar values, are important input parameters for kinetic models of interstellar chemistry. In particular, the amount of carbon relative to oxygen is known to have a strong effect on modeled abundances of many species. While previous studies have focused on comparison of modeled and observed abundances to constrain the C/O ratio, the effects of this parameter on the underlying chemistry have not been well-studied. We investigated the role of the C/O ratio on dark cloud chemistry using the NAUTILUS code and machine learning techniques for molecular representation. We find that modeled abundances are quite sensitive to the C/O ratio, especially for carbon-rich species such as carbon chains and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). CO and simple ice-phase species are found to be major carbon reservoirs under both oxygen-poor and oxygen-rich conditions. The appearance of C3H4 isomers as significant carbon reservoirs, even under oxygen-rich conditions, indicates the efficiency of gas-phase C3 formation followed by adsorption and grain-surface hydrogenation. Our model is not able to reproduce the observed, gas-phase C/H ratio of TMC-1 CP at the time of best fit with any C/O ratio between 0.1 and 3, suggesting that the modeled freeze-out of carbon-bearing molecules may be too rapid. Future investigations are needed to understand the reactivity of major carbon reservoirs and their conversion to complex organic molecules.
#### Characterizing the physical and chemical properties of the Class I protostellar system Oph-IRS 44. Binarity, infalling streamers, and accretion shocks

 - **Abstract**
 (Abridged) In the low-mass star formation process, theoretical models predict that material from the infalling envelope could be shocked as it encounters the outer regions of the disk. Nevertheless, only a few protostars show evidence of these shocks at the disk-envelope interface, and the main formation path of shocked-related species is still unclear. We present new ALMA observations of IRS 44, a Class I source that has previously been associated with accretion shocks, taken at high angular resolution (0.1"). We target multiple molecular transitions of CO, H2CO, and simple sulfur-bearing species. In continuum emission, the binary nature of IRS 44 is observed for the first time at sub-millimeter wavelengths. Infalling signatures are seen for the CO line and the emission peaks at the edges of the continuum emission around IRS 44 B, the same region where bright SO and SO2 emission is seen. Weak CS and H2CO emission is observed, while OCS, H2S, and H2CS transitions are not detected. IRS 44 B seems to be more embedded than IRS 44 A, indicating a non-coeval formation scenario or the rejuvenation of source B due to late infall. CO emission is tracing the outflow component at large scales, infalling envelope material at intermediate scales, and two infalling streamer candidates are identified at disk scales. Infalling streamers might produce accretion shocks when they encounter the outer regions of the infalling-rotating envelope. These shocks heat the dust and release S-bearing species as well as promoting a lukewarm chemistry in the gas phase. With the majority of carbon locked in CO, there is little free C available to form CS and H2CS in the gas, leaving an oxygen-rich environment. The high column densities of SO and SO2 might be a consequence of two processes: direct thermal desorption from dust grains and gas-phase formation due to the availability of O and S.
#### GRB 180728A and SN 2018fip: the nearest high-energy cosmological gamma-ray burst with an associated supernova

 - **Abstract**
 The long GRB 180728A, at a redshift of $z = 0.1171$, stands out due to its high isotropic energy of $E_{\gamma,iso} \sim 2.5 \times 10^{51}$ erg, in contrast with most events at redshift $z<0.2$. We analyze the properties of GRB 180728A's prompt emission, afterglow, and associated supernova SN 2018fip, comparing them with other GRB-SN events. This study employs a dense photometric and spectroscopic follow-up of the afterglow and the SN up to 80 days after the burst, supported by image subtraction to remove the presence of a nearby bright star, and modelling of both the afterglow and the supernova. GRB 180728A lies on the $E_{p,i}-E_{\gamma,iso}$ plane occupied by classical collapsar events, and the prompt emission is one of the most energetic at $z < 0.2$ after GRB 030329 and GRB 221009A. The afterglow of GRB 180728A is less luminous than that of most long GRBs, showing a shallow early phase that steepens around 5 hours (0.2 days). The GRB exploded in an irregular, low-mass, blue, star-forming galaxy, typical of low-z collapsar events. Because of the relatively faint afterglow, the light curve bump of SN 2018fip dominates the optical emission already after $\sim$3 days and is one of the best sampled to date. The strong suppression below $\sim$ 4000 angstrom and a largely featureless continuum in the early 6--9 days spectra favor aspherical two-component ejecta with a high-velocity collimated component ($> 20,000 km s^{-1}$), dominant early-on, and a more massive, low-velocity component, which dominates at much later epochs. Our findings indicate that asymmetries need to be considered in order to better understand GRB-SNe. In any case, SN 2018fip shares many characteristics with typical GRB-SNe. Its kinetic energy is below the common range of $10^{52}-10^{53}$ erg and does not correlate with the high energy of the GRB, highlighting the diversity of the GRB-SN energy budget partition.

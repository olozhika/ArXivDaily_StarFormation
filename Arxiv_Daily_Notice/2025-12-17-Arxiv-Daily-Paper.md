#### Evolving the Loeb Scale

Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA)
 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13743

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.13743

 - **Abstract**
 We develop a differential formulation of the Loeb Scale that extends the original static framework into a radially evolving, real time classification scheme for interstellar objects. By promoting each anomaly metric to a function of heliocentric distance and introducing a relaxation equation for the effective score, our method incorporates memory, hysteresis and predictive capability. This allows us to have early, stable forecasts of an object's eventual Loeb level based on sparse data obtained at large distances, which is more helpful to quantify its true nature when near Earth.

 - **Abstract**
 Cool gas giant exoplanets, particularly those with properties similar to those of Jupiter and Saturn, remain poorly characterized due to current observational limitations. This white paper outlines the transformative science case for the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) to directly image and spectroscopically characterize a broad range of gaseous exoplanets with effective temperatures below 400 K. The study focuses on determining key atmospheric properties, including molecular composition, cloud and haze characteristics, and temperature structure, across planets of varying sizes and orbital separations. Leveraging reflected light spectroscopy and polarimetry, HWO will enable comparative planetology of cool gas giants orbiting both solar-type and M-dwarf stars, bridging the observational gap between hot exoplanets and Solar System giants. We present observational requirements and survey strategies necessary to uncover correlations between atmospheric properties and planetary or stellar parameters. This effort will establish critical constraints on planetary formation, cloud microphysics, and the role of photochemistry under diverse irradiation conditions. The unique capabilities of HWO will make it the first facility capable of characterizing true exo-Jupiters in reflected light, thus offering an unprecedented opportunity to place the Solar System in a broader galactic context.
#### The chemical DNA of the Magellanic Clouds V. R-process dominates neutron capture elements production in the oldest SMC stars

 - **Abstract**
 We present the chemical abundances of Fe, alpha- and neutron-capture elements in 12 metal-poor Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) giant stars, observed with the high-resolution spectrographs UVES/VLT and MIKE/Magellan. These stars have [Fe/H] between -2.3 and -1.4 dex, 10 of them with [Fe/H]<-1.8 dex. According to theoretical age-metallicity relations for this galaxy, these stars formed in the first Gyr of life of the SMC and represent the oldest SMC stars known so far. [alpha/Fe] abundance ratios are enhanced but at a lower level than MW metal-poor stars, as expected according to the slow star formation rate of the SMC. The sample exhibits a large star-to-star scatter in all the neutron-capture elements. The two r-process elements measured in this work (Eu and Sm) have abundance ratios from solar up to +1 dex, three of them with [Eu/Fe]>+0.7 dex and labeled as r-II stars. This [r/Fe] distribution indicates that the r-process in the SMC can be extremely efficient but is still largely affected by the stochastic nature of the main sites of production and the inefficient gas mixing in the early SMC evolution. A similar scatter is observable also for the s-process elements (Y, Ba, La, Ce, Nd), with the stars richest in Eu also being rich in these s-elements. Also, all the stars exhibit subsolar [s/Eu] abundance ratios. At the metallicities of these stars, the production of neutron-capture elements is driven by r-process, because the low-mass AGB stars have not yet evolved and left their s-process signature in the interstellar medium. We also present stochastic chemical evolution models tailored for the SMC that confirm this scenario.
#### Buried but not destroyed: the evolution from prompt cusps to NFW haloes

 - **Abstract**
 The internal structure of dark matter haloes encodes their assembly history and offers critical insight into the nature of dark matter and structure formation. Analytical studies and high-resolution simulations have recently predicted the formation of 'prompt cusps' - steep power-law density profiles that emerge rapidly from the monolithic collapse of primordial peaks. Yet, by $z=0$ most haloes are well described by Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) density profiles, raising the question of how these early cusps are transformed in a cosmological setting. We address this problem using 64 zoom-in $N$-body simulations of eight haloes, each resimulated with eight different free-streaming wavenumbers to control the abundance of small-scale structure while keeping the large-scale environment fixed. To mitigate numerical discreteness effects, we classify artificial fragments and genuine subhaloes with a physically motivated procedure based on matching subhaloes to their progenitor peaks. At the population level, we demonstrate that haloes initially form prompt cusps, and their profiles subsequently transition towards the NFW form. Our study reveals three distinct pathways by which prompt cusps evolve: major mergers, accretion of artificial fragments, and interactions with large-scale filaments, each having a distinct impact on the inner density profile. In particular, we show that the original power-law cusp remains visible in the profile of particles associated with the primordial peak even when the total halo profile is already NFW-like. This work highlights the imprint of early collapse on present-day halo structure and provides new insights into the origin of the universality of the NFW profile.
#### Convective Core Evolution of Main-Sequence Stars in Rapid Population Synthesis I: Framework and Implementation

 - **Abstract**
 Stars spend most of their lifetime on the main sequence (MS), where hydrogen burning establishes the internal chemical structure that governs the subsequent evolution. In massive stars, mass loss through winds and binary interactions can significantly modify this structure during the MS. We present a new MS evolution framework suitable for rapid binary population synthesis, implemented in the COMPAS code. Building on the semi-analytical model of Shikauchi et al. (2025), our framework captures the evolution of the convective core on the MS under arbitrary mass-loss or mass-gain histories, including a treatment for stellar rejuvenation and MS mergers. This new framework yields more massive helium cores at terminal-age MS, more compact radii in stripped MS stars, and systematically higher black hole masses than commonly used prescriptions. By providing a more realistic treatment of MS evolution, this framework improves the physical consistency of massive stars and binary evolution in rapid population synthesis.
#### Primordial Black Holes as Seeds for Extremely Overmassive AGN Observed by JWST

 - **Abstract**
 The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has recently identified Abell 2744-QSO1 as a compact, metal-poor, black hole (BH) dominated galaxy at $z\simeq 7$. This system exhibits an extreme black-hole-to-stellar mass ratio and unusually low metallicity, posing significant challenges to BH seeding models. Motivated by these discoveries, we perform high-resolution cosmological simulations with a massive primordial black hole (PBH; $M_{\rm BH}=5\times10^7\,M_\odot$) seed, incorporating for the first time a fully coupled treatment of PBH accretion, BH feedback, and Population~III/II star formation and stellar feedback. Although PBHs accelerate structure formation through the seed effect, the associated strong thermal feedback from the accretion delays the onset of star formation to $z\lesssim 10$, producing short, bursty episodes throughout the subsequent evolution. PBH-driven outflows expel enriched gas from the nucleus, while sustained inflows from the intergalactic medium continuously replenish pristine material. This feedback-regulated cycle naturally yields low accretion rates ($\dot{m}_{\rm BH}/\dot{m}_{\rm edd} \sim 1-10\%$), subsolar metallicities ($Z/Z_\odot\lesssim10^{-2}$) and extreme $M_{\rm BH}/M_\star$ ratios during both the initial star-forming phase and the subsequent quenching phases, in excellent agreement with JWST observations. Our results demonstrate that massive PBHs offer a viable pathway for forming the most extreme high-redshift systems, providing a physically motivated explanation for the extraordinary properties of Abell 2744-QSO1, as a sub-class of the broader population of JWST-discovered "little red dots".
#### Vertically resolved minimal-set k-distribution for thermal infrared absorption in the Venus atmosphere
 - **Authors:** Boris Fomin, Mikhail Razumovskiy

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14120

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.14120

 - **Abstract**
 The original k-distribution technique is applied to parameterize absorption of thermal radiation in the lower and middle atmosphere of Venus. It is developed for modeling scenarios in which the cost of full radiative transfer calculations necessitates the use of efficient and simplified parameterizations, such as climate modeling. Line-by-line reference modeling based on a Monte Carlo radiative transfer method is embedded into the construction of the k-terms, providing explicit control over accuracy. Using 16 spectral bands spanning 10--6000 cm^{-1}, the method produces 32 k-terms and 16 per-band spectral points for computing Venus cloud optical properties. Vertical resolution of the resulting k-terms is a key advantage, as it avoids the inter-level correlation assumption inherent to the correlated-k method. Height-dependent k(z) functions are supplied on the same vertical grid as the input temperature-pressure profile, enabling direct use in radiative transfer solvers and eliminating the need for vertical interpolation. The implementation yields plausible accuracy below 90 km, with cooling-rate errors of about 1 K day^{-1} and flux errors below 1 percent, while reducing the number of k-terms by a factor of approximately 2.5--3 relative to typical correlated-k approaches. A Fortran driver for generating k(z) functions for arbitrary Venus atmospheric profiles is provided in a public repository.

 - **Abstract**
 There is growing evidence that the Sun might have formed within a nebula impacted by at least one SNR. In this scenario, ejecta and shocks from SNRs may have provided the elements on which life as we know it is based. Investigating the chemical complexity of molecular clouds impacted by SNRs is therefore essential to unveil the star formation process and how life appeared on Earth. In this paper, we exploit this scientific questions and describe which technical specifications will drive in future generation telescopes.

 - **Abstract**
 Absorption spectroscopy toward high-redshift quasars provides strong constraints on the putative variation of fundamental constants of physics on cosmological time scales. The submillimeter ground-state transitions of methylidyne (CH) and water (H2O), both molecules widespread and coeval in the interstellar medium, provide a sensitive test for variations of alpha, the fine structure constant, and mu, the proton-to-electron mass ratio, taking advantage of the unmatched spectral resolution and frequency reliability of radio techniques. We used ALMA simultaneous observations of the two species to constrain any velocity offset between their absorption profiles toward the radio-bright lensed quasars PKS1830-211 (z_abs=0.88582) and B0218+357 (z_abs=0.68466). Our observational setup minimizes instrumental errors and known sources of systematics, such as time variability of the absorption profile and frequency-dependent morphology of the background quasar. The excellent correlation between CH and H2O opacities, the large number of individual narrow velocity components, and the number of independent spectra obtained due to the intrinsic time variability of the absorption profiles ensure that even the chemical segregation bias is minimized. We obtained bulk velocity shifts delta_v = -0.048 pm 0.028 km/s and -0.13 pm 0.14 km/s (1 sigma confidence level) between CH and H2O in the direction of PKS1830-211(NE) and B0218+357(SW), respectively. These values convert into the 3sigma upper limits |Delta_alpha/alpha| < 0.55 ppm and 1.5 ppm, respectively, taking into account the independent upper limits on |Delta_mu/mu| previously obtained for these systems. These constraints on |Delta_alpha/alpha|, at look-back times of about half the present age of the Universe, are two to four times deeper than previous constraints on any other single high-z system.
#### Coexistence of coagulation and streaming instabilities in protoplanetary discs

 - **Abstract**
 The streaming instability is considered one of the leading candidates for the formation of planetesimals, due to its ability to overcome the bouncing and fragmentation barriers. The formation of dense dust clumps through this process, however, is possible provided it involves solids with dimensionless stopping times $\sim 0.1$ in standard discs, which typically corresponds to 1-10 cm-sized particles. This implies that dust coagulation is required for the SI to be an efficient process. Here, we employ unstratified, shearing-box simulations combined with a moment equation for solving the coagulation equation to examine the effect of dust growth on the SI. In dust-rich discs with a dust-to-gas ratio $\epsilon\gtrsim 1$, coagulation is found to have little impact on the SI; while in dust-poor discs with $\epsilon\sim 0.01$, we observe the formation of vertically extended filaments through the action of the coagulation instability (CI), which is triggered due to the dependence of coagulation efficiency on dust density. For moderate dust-to-gas ratios $\epsilon\sim 0.1$ and Stokes numbers $St \lesssim 0.1$, we find onset of the SI within these filaments, with a linear growth rate significantly higher compared to standard SI. We refer to this regime as coagulation-assisted SI. The synergy between both instabilities in that case leads to isotropic turbulence and dust concentrations that are increased by a factor of $30-40$. As dust continues to grow, SI tends to overcome the effect of the CI such that the nonlinear saturation phase is similar to pure SI. Our results suggest that coagulation, by simply increasing dust size, may facilitate the formation of dense clumps through the SI; even though it has only little effect on its nonlinear evolution.
#### Bowshocks driven by the pole-on molecular jet of outbursting protostar SVS 13

 - **Abstract**
 Outflows play a key role in the star and planet formation processes. Some outflows show discrete clumps of cold molecular gas moving at extremely high velocities (EHVs) of $\sim$100 km s$^{-1}$, known as ''molecular bullets'', that are likely closely associated with their primary driving agent. Here we present ALMA CO(J=3-2) observations of a bright EHV molecular bullet that reveal its morphology in detail down to scales of 30 au and its kinematic structure across the entire intermediate velocity range ($\sim$30-100 km s$^{-1}$). These provide important new insights into how outflows transfer mass and momentum to the surrounding medium. The observed channel maps display several sequences of ring-like features whose velocity increases and size decreases with projected distance from the driving source, each sequence tracing a thin, bow-shaped shell culminating on-axis in a bright EHV head. The shape, kinematics, and mass of each shell all agree remarkably well with the simplest textbook models of momentum-conserving bowshocks produced by a time-variable EHV jet. The dynamical timescale between consecutive shells is of a few decades, with the latest ejection event coinciding with the protostar optical/IR outburst observed in $\sim$1990. The very strong evidence for bowshock-driven entrainment induced by jet variability revealed by this work suggests that accretion bursts, and therefore variations in the disk snowlines, should occur on decade timescales, which could substantially impact grain growth and planet formation.

 - **Abstract**
 The Milky Way (MW) is our unique laboratory to test star formation theories at the level of individual stars, serving as the Rosetta Stone to interpret extragalactic observations. The proposed White Paper focuses on the following key questions regarding the structure and evolution of the MW traced by young stellar populations: Q1. How do large-scale dynamical instabilities, like warps and vertical waves, drive the star formation of the Galactic thin disk? Q2. Do star-forming regions form stochastically, driven by local self-propagating feedback, or are they triggered by a common dynamical process acting on Galactic scales? Do internal feedback loops and external interactions tend to sustain or quench star formation in the MW? Q3. Are the clustered star-forming regions the only environments where stars form, or can stars also form in more diffuse structures such as the stellar strings?
#### 1D stellar mergers: entropy sorting and PyMMAMS

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar multiple systems are the norm, not the exception, with many systems undergoing interaction phases during their lifetimes. A subset of these interactions can lead to stellar mergers, where the two components of a stellar binary system come close enough to coalesce into a single star. Accurately modeling stellar mergers requires computationally expensive 3D methods, which are not suited for exploring large parameter spaces as required e.g., by population synthesis studies. In this work, we compare two 1D prescriptions based on the concept of entropy sorting to their 3D counterparts. We employ a basic entropy sorting method ('ES'), which builds the merger remnant by sorting the progenitor stars' shells by increasing entropy, and a Python version of the 'Make Me A Massive Star' code ('PM'), which additionally applies a shock-heating prescription calibrated on SPH simulations of stellar head-on collisions. Comparing to a set of 39 more recent SPH head-on collisions different from the ones used for PM calibration, we find that PM reproduces the outcome of these mergers a lot better than ES in terms of thermal and composition structure post-merger. Both 1D methods produce remnants that are rejuvenated more strongly than expected for massive stars, indicating that increased amounts of hydrogen are being mixed into the core. In an effort to further improve PM, we introduce a scaling factor for the shock-heating. We compare 1D models with both down- and up-scaled heating to a 3D MHD $9 + 8\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$ merger of main-sequence stars. Decreasing the shock-heating improves the agreement in terms of the entropy profile, but has only a minor impact on the subsequent stellar evolution of the remnant. We find that 1D methods are able to approximate 3D stellar merger simulations well, and that shock-heating has to be considered to properly predict the post-merger structures.
#### JWST Observations of the Double Nucleus in NGC 4486B: Possible Evidence for a Recent Binary SMBH Merger and Recoil

 - **Abstract**
 A recent study of the compact elliptical galaxy NGC 4486B using JWST-NIRSpec IFU kinematics confirmed a supermassive black hole (SMBH) of mass $M_{BH}=3.6\pm0.7\times10^8$ (~8% of the stellar mass). In addition to its double nucleus, the nuclear kinematics show pronounced asymmetries: a velocity-dispersion peak displaced by 6 pc from the galaxy center and a ~16 km/s offset in the mean stellar line-of-sight velocity near the SMBH. We examine the origin of the 12 pc double nucleus and these asymmetries and show that the observations favor an SMBH surrounded by an eccentric nuclear disk (END). END formation models require the SMBH to experience a gravitational wave (GW) recoil following a binary SMBH merger. Our orbit-superposition models contain ~50% retrograde stars at the edge of the nuclear region, in striking agreement with END-formation simulations. We infer a pre-merger mass ratio q>0.15 and a recoil kick of ~340 km/s. Our N-body simulations show that with such a kick, the SMBH returns to the center within ~30 Myr. Its flat central core is also consistent with earlier binary black hole scouring. We test two alternative mechanisms-buoyancy-driven oscillations and a pre-merger SMBH binary-but neither reproduces the observed offsets, favoring the GW-kick scenario. Our direct N-body simulations further show that a prograde SMBH binary in a rotating host can stall in a corotation resonance, delaying coalescence. Thus, although NGC 4486B is an old, relaxed galaxy near the Virgo cluster center, its SMBH appears to have merged only recently, making its nucleus a rare nearby laboratory for studying post-merger SMBH dynamics.

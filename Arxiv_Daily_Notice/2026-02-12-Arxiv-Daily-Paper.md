 - **Abstract**
 Tidal disruption events (TDEs) have traditionally been discovered in optical sky surveys through targeted searches of nuclear transients. However, it is expected that some TDEs will occur outside the galaxy nucleus, arising from wandering black holes originating in galaxy mergers. Here we present observations of TDE 2025abcr, the first optical TDE discovered in the outskirts of a host galaxy. The TDE was identified by a custom 'off-nuclear' implementation of the ML classifier $\texttt{tdescore}$, which classifies new ZTF transients based on their lightcurves. Follow-up observations confirm that TDE 2025abcr is a TDE-H+He, occurring 9.5$"$ (10.3 kpc projected distance) from the nucleus of a massive galaxy ($\mathrm{M}_{\star}$ = $10^{11.18 \pm 0.03}\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$) with a central black hole mass of $10^{8.82 \pm 0.65}\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$. TDE 2025abcr itself was likely disrupted by a much lighter black hole ($10^{6.09\pm0.53}\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$, as estimated with peak luminosity scaling relations). The black hole was either dynamically ejected from the nucleus or lies at the center of a very faint tidally-stripped dwarf galaxy undergoing a minor merger. Late-time observations of TDE 2025abcr could confirm the origin of this apparent 'orphan' black hole. The rate of highly offset ($\gtrsim$3 kpc) TDEs can be constrained to $<$10% of the nuclear TDE rate, but our discovery implies that many dozens of similar sources will be detected by the Vera C. Rubin each year with resolvable offsets.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the second set of discoveries from Keck Observations in the INfrared of Taurus and $\rho$ Oph Exoplanets And Ultracool dwarfs (KOINTREAU), an adaptive optics survey of young stars in the Taurus and $\rho$ Oph star-forming regions using Keck/NIRC2 in conjunction with the Keck infrared pyramid wavefront sensor. We have discovered two faint comoving companions to young stars ISO-Oph 96 and 2MASS J16262785-2625152. The companion to ISO-Oph 96, KOINTREAU-3b, is at a projected separation of 340 au (2.49"). Using our NIRC2 photometry and evolutionary models, and assuming that the companion has the same extinction as its host star, we infer that KOINTREAU-3b has a mass of $3.4\pm0.7$ M$_{\rm Jup}$. The companion to 2MASS J16262785-2625152, KOINTREAU-4b, has a projected separation of 180 au (1.25") and could have a mass of either $11.5^{+1.2}_{-1.6}$ M$_{\rm Jup}$ or $15.3^{+0.7}_{-0.8}$ M$_{\rm Jup}$, depending on whether the host star is a member of $\rho$ Oph or Upper Sco.

 - **Abstract**
 The magnetic field of the Sun drives a wide range of eruptive phenomena, from small-scale nanoflares to large flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs). While direct observations of solar activity cover only the past few decades, indirect evidence indicates that the Sun can occasionally produce events orders of magnitude stronger than any recorded ones in the modern era. Two complementary lines of evidence exist. First, extreme solar particle events (ESPEs) have been inferred from prominent spikes in cosmogenic isotope concentrations preserved in precisely dated natural archives such as tree rings and ice cores over the past 15 millennia. Second, high-precision space-borne photometry has revealed superflares on thousands of stars similar to the Sun. Whether these solar and stellar extremes are physically related remains an open question. We summarise the present state of understanding and discuss physical mechanisms that may link them. Although superflares and ESPEs are both extremely energetic manifestations of magnetic energy storage and release, their relationship does not appear to be one-to-one. Their occurrence and energetics likely depend on how magnetic flux and topology govern the partitioning of released energy between radiation, mass ejection, and particle acceleration.
#### Carbon from Interstellar Clouds to Habitable Worlds

 - **Abstract**
 Carbon is an essential element for a habitable world. Inner (r < 3 au) disk planetary carbon compositions are strongly influenced by supply and survival of carbonaceous solids. Here we trace the journey of carbon from the interstellar medium to the processes leading to planet formation. The review highlights the following central aspects: -Organics forming in evolved star envelopes are supplemented by aromatic molecules forming in the dense ISM to represent the seeds of (hydro)carbon supply through pervasive pebble drift to rocky planets and sub-Neptune cores. -Within the protoplanetary disk the sharp gradient in the C/Si content of Solar System bodies and mineral geochemistry outlines a tale of carbon loss from pebbles to within planetesimals and planets, and from planetary atmospheres. -Within two planet formation paradigms (pebble and planetesimal accretion) a range of planetary carbon content is possible that is strongly influenced by early (< 0.5 Myr) formation of a pressure bump that titrates drift. Overall, it is unlikely that the carbon architecture of our Solar System applies to all systems. In the absence of giant planets, carbon-rich rocky worlds and sub-Neptunes may be common. We outline observations that support their presence and discuss habitability of terrestrial worlds.
#### Re-visiting the Canis Major star-forming region with Gaia data release 3 data

 - **Abstract**
 Context: The Canis Major (CMa) star-forming region, a remote molecular cloud complex within the recently discovered Radcliffe Wave, remains under-explored in the literature. Aims: We revisit the stellar census in the CMa region, characterizing its stellar population, kinematics, and age using recent astrometric and photometric data from the third data release of the Gaia space mission (Gaia DR3). Methods: We conducted a membership analysis of Gaia DR3 sources across a 16 deg$^2$ field encompassing the youngest subgroups in CMa. This new stellar census, combined with spectroscopic observations, allowed us to investigate the structure, kinematics, and age of this region. Results: We identified 1531 objects as members of the CMa region, confirming 401 previously known members and introducing 1130 new candidate members. These objects have magnitudes ranging from 10 to 18 mag in the G band from Gaia DR3. We identified two subgroups of CMa stars in our sample labelled as Cluster A and Cluster B. They are located at roughly the same distance ($d_{A} = 1150^{+79}_{-88}$ pc and $d_{B} = 1183^{+103}_{-108}$ pc) and exhibit similar space motions that can be derived thanks to the precise radial velocities obtained in this study. The subgroups have a mean isochronal age of about 2-3 Myr. However, based on infrared photometry we show that Cluster A has a higher fraction of disc-bearing stars suggesting that it could be somewhat younger than Cluster B. Conclusions: Our analysis provides new insights into the stellar population of the Canis Major region, by identifying new members, characterizing their kinematics, and assessing their evolutionary stages. Future studies incorporating additional data from upcoming Gaia data releases, multi-wavelength and high-resolution spectroscopic observations will be essential to further advance our understanding of the history of star formation in this region.
#### Distance Estimation and Sky Localization of Eccentric Double White Dwarf Binaries from Gravitational Wave Observations inside Globular Clusters

 - **Abstract**
 The cosmic distance scale is built on multiple different techniques for estimating distances in space that are often connected and dependent on multiple measurements and assumptions. Double white dwarf binaries (DWDs) are common objects and are expected to produce gravitational wave (GW) signals that can be observed with space-based detectors such as LISA. By analyzing these signals we should be able to estimate the distance and sky location of the source. Previous studies have done this for circular binaries which, while they are abundant, have, in general, weaker signals than eccentric binaries and it is not possible to differentiate whether a circular binary is in the field or in a dense environment such as a globular cluster (GC). In this paper we used eccentric binaries from MOCCA GC simulations, simulated the GW signal from each binary at locations related to GCs in the Milky Way and estimated the precision on the distance and the sky location of the source. We find that distances can be estimated with higher precision than current day methods even with low eccentricity binaries and higher eccentricity further increases this precision. Although the probability of finding a tight and eccentric DWD is far lower than a circular one, we can expect to find at least a few in the dense environments of the Milky Way, such as GCs. These estimations would be independent measurements with high precision to objects inside dense environments, such as GCs inside the Milky Way and the Magellanic Clouds.
#### The metal-poor tail of the APOGEE survey I. Uncovering [Fe/H] < -2.5 stars from the inner Galaxy to the Magellanic Clouds

 - **Abstract**
 In the search for metal-poor stars, large spectroscopic surveys are an invaluable tool. However, the spectra of metal-poor stars can be difficult to analyse because of the relative lack of available lines, which can also lead to misclassification. We aim to identify the stars observed by the APOGEE survey that are below the metallicity limit of APOGEE's analysis. For the highest confidence candidates, we classify the orbital properties of the stars to investigate whether their orbital distribution matches what we would expect for stars that are this metal poor and to select especially interesting targets for spectroscopic follow-up purposes. We examined the properties derived by APOGEE for metal-poor stars from the literature to find signatures of stars with a metallicity below the range of the grid used for spectral analysis. The calibrated APOGEE stellar parameters provide a clear signature of the most metal-poor stars in the survey, indicated by null values for their metallicities while having effective temperatures and surface gravities determined by the pipeline. From comparison with the literature, we find that, within a temperature range of 3700 - 6700 K and above a threshold of S/N > 30, the vast majority of APOGEE stars without calibrated metallicities are very metal poor. The radial velocities provided by APOGEE, Gaia DR3 positions and astrometry along with spectrophotometric distances derived in this work allowed for the computation of their orbits. In this work, we select 289 very metal-poor red giant stars (likely below = -2.5) from the APOGEE results. Our sample contains 16 very metal-poor member candidates of the Magellanic Clouds, 14 very metal-poor stars with orbits confined to the inner Galaxy, and 13 inner Galaxy halo interlopers.
#### A search for new symbiotic stars in the Milky Way: Using machine learning techniques applied to photometric databases

 - **Abstract**
 Symbiotic stars (SySts) are interacting binaries composed of a red giant transferring material to a hot compact star, typically a white dwarf. Although only about 300 systems are confirmed, the Galactic population is estimated at 1.2 x 10^3 - 1.5 x 10^4, indicating that most remain undiscovered. We identify new SySts using a machine-learning approach that combines Gaia DR3, 2MASS, and WISE photometry, parallaxes, and the pseudo-equivalent width of H alpha. A Random Forest model was trained on 166 confirmed S-type SySts and 1600 non-symbiotic stars, applying SMOTE to mitigate class imbalance. The model achieved an F1-score of 89% for the symbiotic class. Applied to 2.5 x 10^6 color-selected sources, it identified 990 candidates with probabilities more than 70%. We further refined the sample using physically motivated cuts on effective temperature, surface gravity, metallicity, and SkyMapper photometry, yielding 12 high-confidence candidates. These objects show cool temperatures, low surface gravities, near-solar metallicity, H alpha emission, moderate-to-high luminosities, and UV excess consistent with S-type SySts. Validation on recently confirmed systems recovered 92.3%, demonstrating the robustness and generalizability of our method.

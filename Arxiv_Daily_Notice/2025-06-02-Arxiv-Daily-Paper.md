 - **Abstract**
 Supersonic turbulence plays a critical role in shaping astrophysical systems, from molecular clouds to the circumgalactic medium. Key properties of this turbulence include the Mach number, driving scale, and nature of the driving mechanism, which can be solenoidal (divergence-free), compressive (curl-free), or a mix of the two. A less studied property is the correlation time of the driving accelerations, $\tau_{\rm a}.$ While this timescale has a minimal impact on solenoidally-driven turbulence, we show that it has a strong impact on compressively-driven turbulence. Using high-resolution simulations with tracer particles, we analyze the evolution of density fluctuations, focusing on the PDF of the logarithmic density, $s$, and its rate of change, $\frac{ds}{dt},$ and the conditional statistics of $\frac{ds}{dt}$ and $\frac{d^2s}{dt^2}$. When the driving correlation time is comparable to the eddy turnover time, $\tau_{\rm a} \approx \tau_{\rm e},$ compressive driving leads to the formation of large, low-density voids in which the variance of $\frac{ds}{dt}$ is large. These are directly linked to sustained accelerated expansions, which results in a strong correlation between density and the divergence of the driving acceleration field. In contrast, when $\tau_{\rm a} \approx 0.1 \, \tau_{\rm e}$, compressive driving does not produce such voids, resulting in a narrower, less skewed distribution. We show using analytical estimates that $\tau_{\rm a}$ is may be significantly less than $\tau_{\rm e}$ in supernova-driven turbulence, highlighting the need to better understand the role of the driving correlation time in shaping the density structure of turbulent astrophysical systems.

 - **Abstract**
 The superfluid dark matter model offers an elegant solution to reconcile discrepancies between the predictions of the cold dark matter paradigm and observations on galactic scales. In this scenario, dark matter is composed of ultralight bosons with self-interactions that can undergo a superfluid phase transition in galactic environments. In this review, we explore the theoretical foundations of dark matter superfluidity, detailing the conditions required for the formation and stability of superfluid cores of astrophysical size. We examine the phenomenological consequences for galactic dynamics, including the impact on galaxy mergers, the formation of vortices, the behavior near supermassive black holes, modifications to dynamical friction, and the emergence of long-range interactions. By synthesizing theoretical developments with observational constraints, we aim to provide a comprehensive overview of the current status and future prospects of dark matter superfluidity as a viable extension of the standard cosmological model.
#### Bridging Unstratified and Stratified Simulations of the Streaming Instability for $τ_s=0.1$ Grains

 - **Abstract**
 The streaming instability (SI), driven by aerodynamic coupling between solids and the gas under a global radial pressure gradient, concentrates solids and facilitates planetesimal formation. Unstratified simulations are commonly used to study the SI, based on the assumption that they approximate conditions near the disk midplane. However, it remains unclear how accurately these unstratified simulations capture the midplane dust-gas dynamics in stratified disks. To address this, we examine the saturated state of the SI in stratified simulations and compare dust-gas dynamics to those in unstratified simulations across various radial pressure gradients. To this end, we consider a dimensionless dust stopping time ($\tau_s$) of 0.1 and perform 2D axisymmetric, stratified simulations. We find that the formation of dust filaments during dust settling exhibits morphological similarities to those in unstratified simulations. In the saturated state, we find that as the pressure gradient increases, the velocity dispersions of the gas and dust, as well as the strength of dust diffusion, increase. Most importantly, at any given pressure gradient, the velocity dispersions and density distributions of the gas and dust in our stratified simulations closely match those in unstratified simulations. While further exploration across the parameter space is needed, our results suggest that, for $\tau_s=0.1$, unstratified simulations represents well the midplane dust--gas dynamics in stratified disks before any strong clumping occurs. Consequently, our results confirm that in the saturated state, the streaming turbulence in stratified simulations behaves similarly to that in unstratified simulations for the parameter values explored here.

 - **Abstract**
 Several models of nuclear dust in active galactic nuclei (AGN) have been presented in the literature to determine its physical and geometrical properties, usually assuming the dust density distribution as the main aspect producing differences in the mid-infrared (MIR) emission of AGNs. We present a study of the MIR emission of nearby AGNs by exploring the effects of dust distribution and chemical composition on the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) using radiative transfer simulations. Our model grid includes smooth, clumpy, and two-phase dust distributions, combined with two dust compositions: the interstellar medium (ISM) dust composition including large grains (up to $\rm{10 \ \mu m}$), and the oxide/silicate-based composition from Reyes-Amador et al. (2024). A synthetic SED library was generated and analysed both on a model-to-model basis and with observed MIR spectra from 68 AGNs. We found that dust density distribution and dust composition significantly influence the spectral shapes and silicate features at $10$ and $\rm{18 \ \mu m}$, especially at edge-on orientations. The smooth distribution produces stronger and broader silicate absorption features, while the clumpy distribution generates stronger features in emission. The two-phase distributions exhibit intermediate characteristics depending on the clumpiness fraction ($f_{\text{cl}}$) and filling factor ($f_{\text{fill}}$). The ISM dust composition with large grains is more suited to reproduce the observed features and a higher fraction of good fits, particularly with Type-2 SEDs, independently of dust density distributions. The Reyes-Amador et al. (2024) composition provides a larger number of good fits with Type-1 SEDs for $f_{\text{cl}} \leq 0.5$, and with Type-2 SEDs for $f_{\text{cl}} \geq 0.9$. This work shows that no single dust distribution or composition reproduces all observations.

 - **Abstract**
 Sunspots survive on the solar surface for time-scales ranging from days to months. This requires them to be in an equilibrium involving magnetic fields and hydrodynamic forces. Unfortunately, theoretical models of sunspot equilibrium are very simplified as they assume that spots are static and possess a self-similar and axially symmetric magnetic field. These assumptions neglect the role of small scale variations of the magnetic field along the azimuthal direction produced by umbral dots, light bridges, penumbral filaments, and so forth. We aim at studying whether sunspot equilibrium is maintained once azimuthal fluctuations in the magnetic field, produced by the sunspot fine structure, are taken into account. To this end we apply the FIRTEZ Stokes inversion code to spectropolarimetric observations to infer the magnetic and thermodynamic parameters in two sunspots located at disk center and observed with two different instruments: one observed from the ground with the 1.5-meter German GREGOR Telescope and another with the Japanese spacecraft Hinode. We compare our results with three dimensional radiative magnetohydrodynamic simulations of a sunspot carried out with the MuRAM code. We infer clear variations in the gas pressure and density of the plasma directly related to fluctuations in the Lorentz force and associated with the filamentary structure in the penumbra. Similar results are obtained in the umbra despite its lack of observed filamentary structure. Results from the two observed sunspots are in excellent qualitative and quantitative agreement with the numerical simulations. Our results indicate that the magnetic topology of sunspots along the azimuthal direction is very close to magnetohydrostatic equilibrium, thereby helping to explain why sunspots are such long-lived structures capable of surviving on the solar surface for days or even full solar rotations.

 - **Abstract**
 Assuming that white dwarf (WD) magnetic fields are generated by a crystallization- and rotation-driven dynamo, the impact of the late appearance of WD magnetic fields in cataclysmic variables (CVs) has been shown to potentially solve several long-standing problems of CV evolution. However, recent theoretical works show that the dynamo idea might not be viable and that the late appearance of WD magnetic fields might be an age effect rather than related to the cooling of the core of the WD. We investigated the impact of the late appearance of WD magnetic fields on CV evolution assuming that the fields appear at fixed WD ages. We performed CV population synthesis with the BSE code to determine the fractions of CVs that become magnetic atcdifferent evolutionary stages. These simulations were complemented with MESA tracks that take into account the transfer of spin angular momentum to the orbit which can cause a detached phase. We find that the observed fraction of magnetic CVs as a function of orbital period is well reproduced by our simulations, and that in many CVs the WD should become magnetic close to the period minimum. The detached phase generated by the transfer of spin angular momentum is longest for period bouncers. Interpreting the late appearance of strong WD magnetic fields as a simple age effect naturally explains the relative numbers of magnetic CVs in observed samples. As many period bouncers might detach for several gigayears, the late appearance of WD magnetic fields at a fixed age and independent of the core temperature of the WD can significantly reduce the predicted number of accreting period bouncers.

 - **Abstract**
 In this article, we present the relationship between prominence eruptions (PEs) and coronal mass ejections (CMEs) from May 2010 to December 2019 covering most of solar cycle 24. We used data from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) for PEs and the Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO) for CMEs. We identified 1225 PEs, with 67% being radial, 32% transverse, and 1% failed PEs. The radial, transverse PEs, and the combined set have average speeds of ~53, 9, and 38 km/s, respectively. The PE association with CMEs is examined by assigning a confidence level (CL) from 0 (no association) to 3 (clear association). Out of 1225 PEs, 662 (54%) are found to be associated to CMEs including CL 1, 2, and 3. Our study reveals that the spatial and temporal relationships between PEs and CMEs vary over the solar cycle. During solar minima, CMEs tend to deflect towards the equator, possibly due to a stronger polar field. Temporal offsets are larger during solar maxima and smaller during the minima. This implies that the PEs appear in LASCO C2 FOV earlier during the minima than during the maxima. Among the 662 CMEs associated with PEs, 78% show clear bright core structures. Investigation of the morphological and temporal behavior of these CMEs indicate that the prominences evolves into CME cores at higher altitudes suggesting that PEs and CME cores are the same structure. The average speeds of the PEs, CME core, and CME leading edge are 62, 390, and 525 km/s, respectively. The speed of CME cores are more than the speed of PEs because the former are observed at larger heights where they have accelerated to higher speeds.

 - **Abstract**
 We study the chromospheric LOS velocities during the GOES M3.2 flare (SOL2013-05-17T08:43) using simultaneous spectroscopic data of the He I 1083.0 nm triplet and Ca II 854.2 nm line. A filament was present in the flaring area. The observational data were acquired with the VTT (Tenerife, Spain) and covered the pre-flare, flare, and post-flare phases. Spectroscopic inversion techniques (HAZEL and STiC) were applied individually to He I and Ca II lines to recover the atmospheric parameters. Different inversion configurations were tested for Ca II and two families of solutions were found to explain the red asymmetry of the profiles: a redshifted emission feature or a blueshifted absorption feature. These solutions could explain two different flare scenarios (condensation vs. evaporation). The ambiguity was solved by comparing these results to the He I inferred velocities. At the front of the flare ribbon, we observed a thin, short-lived blueshifted layer. This is seen in both spectral regions but is much more pronounced in He I, with velocities of up to -10 km/s. In addition, at the front we found the coexistence of multiple He I profiles within one pixel. The central part of the ribbon is dominated by He I and Ca II redshifted emission profiles. A flare-loop system, visible only in He I absorption and not in Ca II, becomes visible in the post-flare phase and shows strong downflows at the footpoints of up to 39 km/s. In the flare, the Ca II line represents lower heights compared to the quiet Sun, with peak sensitivity shifting from $\log \tau \simeq -5.2$ to $\log \tau \simeq -3.5$. The inferred LOS velocities support a cool-upflow scenario at the leading edge of the flare. The solar filament in the region remained stable. The inclusion of the He I triplet in the analysis helped resolve the ambiguity between two possible solutions for the plasma velocities detected in the Ca II line.
#### JWST NIRISS Transmission Spectroscopy of the Super-Earth GJ 357b, a Favourable Target for Atmospheric Retention

 - **Abstract**
 We present a JWST NIRISS/SOSS transmission spectrum of the super-Earth GJ 357 b: the first atmospheric observation of this exoplanet. Despite missing the first $\sim$40 % of the transit due to using an out-of-date ephemeris, we still recover a transmission spectrum that does not display any clear signs of atmospheric features. We perform a search for Gaussian-shaped absorption features within the data but find that this analysis yields comparable fits to the observations as a flat line. We compare the transmission spectrum to a grid of atmosphere models and reject, to 3-$\sigma$ confidence, atmospheres with metallicities $\lesssim$100$\times$ solar ($\sim$4 g/mol) with clouds at pressures down to 0.01 bar. We analyse how the retention of a secondary atmosphere on GJ 357 b may be possible due to its higher escape velocity compared to an Earth-sized planet and the exceptional inactivity of its host star relative to other M2.5V stars. The star's XUV luminosity decays below the threshold for rapid atmospheric escape early enough that the volcanic revival of an atmosphere of several bars of CO$_2$ is plausible, though subject to considerable uncertainty. Finally, we model the feasibility of detecting an atmosphere on GJ 357 b with MIRI/LRS, MIRI photometry, and NIRSpec/G395H. We find that, with two eclipses, it would be possible to detect features indicative of an atmosphere or surface. Further to this, with 3-4 transits, it would be possible to detect a 1 bar nitrogen-rich atmosphere with 1000 ppm of CO$_2$.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we perform a statistical inference of the classical background law governing the evolution of the temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMB), given by $T_{\rm CMB}(z) = T_0(1 + z)$. To this end, we employ Gaussian Process (GP) regression techniques to reconstruct the temperature evolution based on two observational datasets: (i) CMB-Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) cluster measurements and (ii) CMB-interstellar medium (ISM) interaction data. Our analysis reveals interesting results that may suggest potential deviations from the standard temperature-redshift relation, particularly at low redshifts ($z < 0.5$), where discrepancies up to $\sim$2$\sigma$ are observed. Additionally, we identify a mild but noteworthy tension, also at the $\sim$2$\sigma$ level, between our GP inferred value of the present-day CMB temperature, $T_{\rm CMB}(z=0)$, and the precise direct measurement from the COBE/FIRAS experiment. We also explore possible phenomenological implications of our findings, including interpretations associated with possible variations in fundamental constants, such as the fine-structure constant $\alpha$, which could provide a physical explanation for the observed deviations at low redshift.

 - **Abstract**
 High-spatial-resolution observations of disks around young stars suggest planetary systems begin forming early, during the protostellar phase (< 1 Myr) when stars accrete most of their mass via infall from the surrounding cloud. During this era shocks are expected to be ubiquitous around the gaseous accretion disk due to supersonic infall that strikes the disk. We investigate the role of shocks using a theoretical and modeling framework we call the shock twist-angle Keplerian (STAK) disk, connecting the disk and infalling envelope gas via a shock using general physical principles. Briefly, at the shock, energy is dissipated while angular momentum is conserved, so that the infalling gas must change direction sharply, yielding a bend or twist in the streamlines. The model's pre-shock gas follows free-fall parabolic trajectories, while the post-shock gas is on lower-energy, elliptical orbits. We construct synthetic observations and find that the deviations from circular Keplerian orbits are detectable in Doppler-shifted molecular spectral lines using radio interferometers such as ALMA. Specifically, the STAK model leads to line emission intensity and velocity-moment maps that are asymmetric and offset with respect to the disk structure traced by the dust continuum. We examine archival ALMA data for the class 0/I protostar L1527 and find the C$^{18}$O velocity moment map has features resembling the disk plus envelope emission that naturally arise when the two are connected by a shock. Thus, spectral line observations having sub-km/s spectral resolution and angular resolution sufficient to fully resolve the disk can reveal protostars' envelope-disk shocks.

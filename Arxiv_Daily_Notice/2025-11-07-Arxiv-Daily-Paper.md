#### Photon Orbit Signatures in Spectra of Black Hole Accretion Disks

 - **Abstract**
 Light orbiting an accreting black hole may impact the disk or jet multiple times before escaping to the observer, at a variety of angles with respect to the local magnetic field. In this letter, we characterize the imprints of these long path lengths and disparate magnetic field impacts in synchrotron spectra of hot accretion disks, as the strongly lensed ``photon ring'' exhibits a higher synchrotron turnover frequency in each lensed sub-image. We apply tools of varying complexity: first, we develop a minimal, unlensed one-zone model that isolates the first two sub-images of the accretion flow. By varying the magnetic field geometry encountered by each sub-image, we show that distinctive spectral signatures emerge in both total intensity and fractional linear polarization. Second, we examine a semi-analytic radiatively inefficient accretion flow (RIAF) model, in which we find that there is generally a frequency at which the first indirect image outshines the direct image even in total flux density. Lastly, we demonstrate that even general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulation snapshots show this spectral character. We find a typical correction to the unresolved spectrum of order $10\%$ near the turnover frequency that grows with increasing viewing inclination, growing to order unity at higher frequencies. We predict sensitive spectral studies of the cores of Messier 87* and Sagittarius A* at frequencies exceeding $300$ GHz to constrain the existence of the photon ring even without imaging, with prospects for photon ring detection even in other sources with unresolved shadows.

 - **Abstract**
 The detection of ultra-high-energy (UHE) neutrinos in the EeV range is the goal of current and future in-ice radio arrays at the South Pole and in Greenland. Here, we present a deep neural network that can reconstruct the main neutrino properties of interest from the raw waveforms recorded by the radio antennas: the neutrino direction, the energy of the particle shower induced by the neutrino interaction, and the event topology, thereby estimating the neutrino flavor. For the first time, we predict the full posterior PDF for the energy and direction reconstruction via neural posterior estimation utilizing conditional normalizing flows, enabling event-by-event uncertainty prediction. We improve over previous reconstruction algorithms and obtain a median resolution of 0.30 log(E) and 18 square degrees for a 'shallow' detector component and 0.08 log(E) and 28 square degrees for a 'deep' detector component for neutral current (NC) events at a shower energy of 1 EeV. This deep learning approach also allows us to reconstruct the more stochastic $\nu_e$ - charged current (CC) events. We quantify the impact of different antenna types and systematic uncertainties on the reconstruction and derive a goodness-of-fit score to test the compatibility of measured neutrino signals with the Monte Carlo simulations used to train the neural network.
#### SOFIA FEEDBACK Survey: The Eagle Nebula in [C II] and Molecular Lines

 - **Abstract**
 We characterize the physical conditions and energy budget of the M16 H II region using SOFIA FEEDBACK observations of the [C II] 158 $\mu$m line. The O stars in the $\sim 10^{4}~{\rm M}_{\odot}$ NGC 6611 cluster powering this H II region have blown at least 2 cavities into the giant molecular cloud: the large M16 cavity and the small N19 bubble. We detect the spectroscopic signature of an expanding photodissociation region shell towards N19, and traces of a thin, fragmented expanding shell towards M16. Our [C II] observations are resolved to 0.5 km s$^{-1}$ and 15.5$^{\prime\prime}$ and analyzed alongside similarly resolved CO J=3$-$2 observations as well as archival data ranging from the radio to X-ray tracing a variety of gas phases spanning dense $\sim$10 K molecular gas, $10^{4}$ K photoionized gas, and million-K collisionally ionized plasma. With this dataset, we evaluate the coupling of energetic feedback from NGC 6611 and the O9 V star within N19 to the surrounding gas. Winds from NGC 6611 have blown a 20 pc radius cavity constrained in size along the major axis of the natal giant molecular filament, and much of the mechanical wind energy ($>$90%) has escaped through breaches in the $\lesssim 10^{4}~{\rm M}_{\odot}$ shell. Reservoirs of dense gas remain within a few parsecs of the cluster. N19, younger than M16 by $\gtrsim 10^6$ yr, is driven by a combination of mechanical wind energy and thermal pressure from photoionized gas and has swept up $\sim 10^{3}~{\rm M}_{\odot}$ into neutral atomic and molecular shells.
#### Cosmic voids and the kinetic analysis. V. Hubble tension, the cosmological constant and aperiodic filaments
 - **Authors:** V.G. Gurzadyan, N.N. Fimin, V.M. Chechetkin

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.03990

 - **Abstract**
 The appearance and specific properties of the structures in the local Universe are studied by means of the Vlasov kinetic technique. The role of the cosmological constant in the local structure formation is considered via the theorem on the general function satisfying the identity of the gravity of sphere and of point mass. Then, the Hubble tension is naturally explained as a result of two flows, local and global one, with non-coinciding Hubble parameters. The linearized Vlasov-Poisson equation with the cosmological term is shown to lead to van Kampen's waves, of Landau damping and then to aperiodic structures. The aperiodicity thus is emerging as a intrinsic feature of the filamentary and void structure of the local Universe, revealing the self-consistent field mechanism of its formation. The damping of the aperiodicity then is predicted and can be observationally traced upon the increase of the scale of the filaments.
#### Low redshift observational constraints on dark energy models using ANN - CosmicANNEstimator

 - **Abstract**
 We present CosmicANNEstimator (Cosmological Parameters Artificial Neural Network Estimator), a machine learning approach for constraining cosmological parameters within the Lambda Cold Dark Matter ($\Lambda$CDM) framework. Our methodology employs two specialized artificial neural networks (ANNs) designed to analyze Hubble parameter and Supernova data independently. The estimator is trained on synthetic data covering broad parameter ranges, with Gaussian random noise incorporated to simulate observational uncertainties. Our results demonstrate parameter estimates and associated uncertainties comparable to traditional Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, establishing machine learning as an efficient alternative for cosmological parameter estimation. This work underscores the potential of neural network-based inference to complement traditional Bayesian methods and accelerate future cosmological analyses.
#### Machine-Learning Estimation of Energy Fractions in MHD Turbulence Modes

 - **Abstract**
 Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence plays a central role in many astrophysical processes in the interstellar medium (ISM), including star formation, heat conduction, and cosmic-ray scattering. MHD turbulence can be decomposed into three fundamental modes-fast, slow, and Alfvén-each contributing differently to the dynamics of the medium. However, characterizing and separating the energy fractions of these modes was challenging due to the limited information available from observations. To address this difficulty, we use 3D isothermal and multiphase MHD turbulence simulations to examine how mode energy fractions vary under different physical conditions. Overall, we find that the Alfvén and slow modes carry comparable kinetic-energy fractions and together dominate the turbulent energy budget in multiphase media, while the fast mode contributes the smallest fraction. Relative to isothermal conditions, multiphase simulations exhibit an enhanced fast-mode energy fraction. We further introduce a machine-learning-based approach that employs a conditional Residual Neural Network to infer these fractions directly from spectroscopic data. The method leverages the fact that the three MHD modes imprint distinct morphological signatures in spectroscopic maps owing to their differing anisotropies and compressibilities. Our model is trained on a suite of isothermal and multiphase simulations covering typical ISM conditions. We further demonstrate that our machine learning model can robustly recover the mode fractions from spectroscopic observables, achieving mean absolute errors of approximately 0.05 for seen data and 0.1 for unseen data.
#### Neural Network identification of Dark Star Candidates. I. Photometry

 - **Abstract**
 The formation of the first stars in the universe could be significantly impacted by the effects of Dark Matter (DM). Namely, if DM is in the form of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs), it could lead to the formation (at $z\sim 25-10$) of stars that are powered by DM annihilations alone, i.e. Dark Stars (DSs). Those objects can grow to become supermassive ($M\sim 10^6 \Msun$) and shine as bright as a galaxy ($L\sim 10^8 \Msun)$. Using a simple $\chi^2$ minimization, the first three DSs photometric candidates (i.e. \JADESeleven, \JADEStwelve, and \JADESzthirteen) were identified by \cite{Ilie:2023JADES}. Our goal is to develop tools to streamline the identification of such candidates within the rather large publicly available high redshift JWST data sets. We present here the key first step in achieving this goal: the development and implementation of a feed-forward neural network (FFNN) search for Dark Star candidates, using data from the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES) photometric catalog. Our method reconfirms JADES-GS-z13 and JADES-GS-z11 as dark star candidates, based on the chi-squared goodness of fit test, yet they are $\sim10^4$ times faster than the Neadler-Mead $\chi^2$ minimization method used in \cite{Ilie:2023JADES}. We further identify six {\it new photometric} Dark Star candidates across redshifts $z \sim 9$ to $z \sim 14$. These findings underscore the power of neural networks in modeling non-linear relationships and efficiently analyzing large-scale photometric surveys, advancing the search for Dark Stars.
#### 3D Non-LTE radiation transfer: theory and applications to stars, exoplanets, and kilonovae

 - **Abstract**
 Most of the physical information about astrophysical objects is obtained via the analysis of their electromagnetic spectra. Observed data coupled with radiation transfer models in physical conditions representative of stars, planets, kilonovae, and ISM, yield constrains on their physical structure, gas flow dynamics at the surface, mass loss, and detailed chemical composition of the systems. All these core astrophysical parameters are just as reliable as the physical quality of the models that are employed for simulations of radiation transfer. Recent advances in multi-D transfer modeling with Non-Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (NLTE) in inhomogeneous time-dependent systems revealed systematic shortcomings of canonical models. Owing to major complexities of solving coupled multi-frequency RT equations in 3D geometry, a number of approximations have been introduced. This review presents an overview of the physical problem, standard solutions, and recent methodological advances. We also provide an overview of main results in the area of 3D NLTE radiation transfer and its applications to modeling diverse astrophysical environments, including FGKM type- and OBA-type stars, multi-epoch spectra of kilonovae, and atmospheres of rocky and gaseous exoplanets.
#### Massive stars exploding in a He-rich circumstellar medium XII. SN 2024acyl: A fast, linearly declining Type Ibn supernova with early flash-ionisation features

 - **Abstract**
 We present a photometric and spectroscopic analysis of the Type Ibn supernova (SN) 2024acyl. It rises to an absolute magnitude peak of about -17.58 mag in 10.6 days, and displays a rapid linear post-peak light-curve decline in all bands, similar to most SNe Ibn. The optical pseudobolometric light curve peaks at ($3.5\pm0.8) \times 10^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$, with a total radiated energy of $(5.0\pm0.4) \times 10^{48}$ erg. The spectra are dominated by a blue continuum at early stages, with narrow P-Cygni \Hei~lines and flash-ionisation emission lines of C {\sc iii}, N {\sc iii}, and He {\sc ii}. The P-Cygni \Hei~features gradually evolve and become emission-dominated in late-time spectra. The \Ha~line is detected throughout the entire spectral evolution, which indicates that the CSM is helium-rich with some residual amount of H. Our multiband light-curve modelling yields estimates of the ejecta mass of $M_{ej}$ = $0.98^{+0.30}_{-0.20} \, \msun$, with a kinetic energy of $E_{k} = 0.13^{+0.03}_{-0.02} \times 10^{51}$ erg, and a $^{56}Ni$ mass of $M_{\mathrm{Ni}} = 0.017 \, \msun$. The inferred CSM properties are characterised by a mass of $M_{\rm{CSM}} = 0.39^{+0.04}_{-0.04}$ \msun, an inner radius of $R_0$=$15.6^{+1.9}_{-2.0}$ AU, and a density $\rho_{CSM} = (1.32\pm0.22)\times10^{-11} \, \mathrm{g\,cm^{-3}}$. The multi-epoch spectra are well reproduced by the CMFGEN/ \texttt{he4p0} model, corresponding to a He-ZAMS mass of 4~M$_\odot$. These findings are consistent with a scenario of an SN powered by ejecta-CSM interaction, originating from a low-mass helium star that evolved within an interacting binary system where the CSM with some residual hydrogen may originate from the mass-transfer process. In addition, a channel of core-collapse explosion of a late-type Wolf-Rayet star with H, or an Ofpe/WN9 star with fallback accretion, cannot be entirely ruled out.

 - **Abstract**
 The Euclid Quick Data Release 1 (Q1) encompasses 30 million sources across 63.1 square degrees, marking the beginning of petabyte-scale data delivery through Data Release 1 (DR1) and subsequent releases. Systematic exploitation of such datasets requires extracting millions of source-specific cutouts, yet standard tools like Astropy's Cutout2D process sources individually, creating bottlenecks for large catalogues. We introduce Cutana, a memory-efficient software tool optimised for batch processing in both local and cloud-native environments. Cutana employs vectorised NumPy operations to extract cutout batches simultaneously from FITS tiles, implements automated memory-aware scheduling, and supports both Zarr and FITS output formats with multiple common normalisation schemes (asinh, log, zscale). Cutana outperforms Astropy in all tested Q1 subset scenarios achieving near linear scaling and processing thousands of cutouts per second. On just four worker threads, Cutana can process all of Q1 in under four hours. The tool includes an ipywidget interface for parameter configuration and real-time monitoring. Integration with ESA Datalabs is underway for the Euclid DR1 release, with open-source release pending ESA open-source licensing processes.
#### The ALMA-ATOMS-QUARKS survey: Resolving a chemically rich massive protostellar outflow

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.04504

 - **Abstract**
 We present a comprehensive study on the physical and chemical structures of a chemically rich bipolar outflow in a high-mass star forming region IRAS 16272$-$4837 (SDC335), utilizing high-resolution spectral line data at 1.3 mm and 3 mm dual-bands from the ALMA ATOMS and QUARKS surveys. The high-velocity jet is enveloped by a lower-velocity outflow cavity, containing bright knots that show enhanced molecular intensities and elevated excitation temperatures. Along the outflow, we have identified 35 transitions from 22 molecular species. By analyzing the spatial distribution and kinematics of these molecular lines, we find that the molecular inventory in the outflow is regulated by three processes: (i) direct entrainment from the natal molecular core by the outflow; (ii) shock-induced release of molecules or atoms from dust grains; and (iii) thermal desorption and gas-phase reactions driven by shock heating. These results confirm that outflows are not only dynamical structures but also active chemical factories, where entrainment, shocks, and thermal processing jointly enrich the molecular content. Our findings confirmed that outflow chemistry has multi-origin nature, and provide critical insights into chemical evolution during high-mass star formation.
#### Dynamical Masses of Young Stellar Multiple Systems with the VLBA (DYNAMO-VLBA)

 - **Abstract**
 Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) provides high angular resolution images and has been used for stellar astrometry for decades. The DYNAMO-VLBA project utilizes the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) to study tight binary and multiple pre-main sequence stars, whose components have detectable radio emission and typical separations on the order of milli-arcseconds. Such systems cannot be resolved by Gaia, making VLBI an essential tool for the study of their orbital parameters and, eventually, the determination of their mass. Here, we report VLBA dynamical mass measurements of the individual stars in the S1 system in Ophiuchus and EC\,95 in Serpens. S1 is the most luminous and massive stellar member of the nearby Ophiuchus star-forming region. We find that the primary component, S1A, has a mass of $4.11 \pm 0.10\,M_{\odot}$. This is significantly less than the value of $\sim6\,M_{\odot}$ expected from theoretical models given the location of S1A on the HR diagram. The secondary, S1B, has a mass of $0.831 \pm 0.014\,M_{\odot}$ and is most likely a T Tauri star. In the Serpens triple system EC\,95, we measure the masses of EC\,95A and EC\,95B, finding $2.15\pm0.10$ M$_\odot$ and $2.00\pm0.12$ M$_\odot$, respectively. In this case, the measured masses agree with the location of the stars in the HR diagram for very young 2 $M_\odot$ stars. For the first time, we also estimated the mass of tertiary, EC\,95C, to be 0.26 $^{+0.53}_{-0.46}$ M$_\odot$.
#### $\texttt{unimpeded}$: A Public Grid of Nested Sampling Chains for Cosmological Model Comparison and Tension Analysis

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.04661

 - **Abstract**
 Bayesian inference is central to modern cosmology, yet comprehensive model comparison and tension quantification remain computationally prohibitive for many researchers. To address this, we release $\texttt{unimpeded}$, a publicly available Python library and data repository providing pre-computed nested sampling and MCMC chains. We apply this resource to conduct a systematic analysis across a grid of eight cosmological models, including $\Lambda$CDM and seven extensions, and 39 datasets, including individual probes and their pairwise combinations. Our model comparison reveals that whilst individual datasets show varied preferences for model extensions, the base $\Lambda$CDM model is most frequently preferred in combined analyses, with the general trend suggesting that evidence for new physics is diluted when probes are combined. Using five complementary statistics, we quantify tensions, finding the most significant to be between DES and Planck (3.57$\sigma$) and SH0ES and Planck (3.27$\sigma$) within $\Lambda$CDM. We characterise the $S_8$ tension as high-dimensional ($d_G=6.62$) and resolvable in extended models, whereas the Hubble tension is low-dimensional and persists across the model space. Caution should be exercised when combining datasets in tension. The $\texttt{unimpeded}$ data products, hosted on Zenodo, provide a powerful resource for reproducible cosmological analysis and underscore the robustness of the $\Lambda$CDM model against the current compendium of data.

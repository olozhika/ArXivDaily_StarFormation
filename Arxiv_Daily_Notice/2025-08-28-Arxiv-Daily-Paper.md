 - **Abstract**
 NGC 6302 is a spectacular bipolar planetary nebula (PN) whose spectrum exhibits fast outflows and highly ionized emission lines, indicating the presence of a very hot central star (~220,000 K). Its infrared spectrum reveals a mixed oxygen and carbon dust chemistry, displaying both silicate and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) features. Using the JWST Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) and Medium Resolution Spectrometer, a mosaic map was obtained over the core of NGC 6302, covering the wavelength range of 5--28 micron and spanning an area of ~18.5 arcsec x15 arcsec. The spatially resolved spectrum reveals ~200 molecular and ionized lines from species requiring ionisation potentials of up to 205 eV. The spatial distributions highlight a complex structure at the nebula's centre. Highly ionized species such as Mg VII and Si VII show compact structures, while lower-ionization species such as H^+ extend much farther outwards, forming filament-defined rims that delineate a bubble. Within the bubble, the H^+ and H_2 emission coincide, while the PAH emission appears farther out, indicating an ionization structure distinct from typical photodissociation regions, such as the Orion Bar. This may be the first identification of a PAH formation site in a PN. This PN appears to be shaped not by a steady, continuous outflow, but by a series of dynamic, impulsive bubble ejections, creating local conditions conducive to PAH formation. A dusty torus surrounds the core, primarily composed of large (micron-sized) silicate grains with crystalline components. The long-lived torus contains a substantial mass of material, which could support an equilibrium chemistry and a slow dust-formation process.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. We investigate the binding energies of atoms to interstellar dust particles, which play a key role in their growth and evolution, as well as for the chemical reactions on their surfaces. Aims. We aim to compute the binding energies of abundant atoms in the interstellar medium (C, N, O, Mg, Al, Si, S, Ca, Fe, and Ni) to silicate dust. Methods. We used the Geometries, Frequencies, and Non-covalent Interactions Tight Binding (GFN1-xTB) method to compute the binding energies. An FeMgSiO$_4$ periodic surface model, containing 81 local minima on the surface, was used. Results. A range of binding energies was found for each element. The median of the binding energies follows the order Si (14.8 eV) > Al (12.8 eV) > Ca (12.7 eV) > C (9.5 eV) > O (8.1 eV) > N (6.2 eV) > Fe (6.0 eV) > S (5.2 eV) > Mg (2.4 eV). The probability distribution of binding energies for each element except Ca is statistically consistent with a log-normal distribution. Conclusions. In general, Si, Ca, and Al atoms have large binding energies. Thus, these atoms can stay on the silicate dust particles at high temperatures. The binding energies of the other atoms, C, N, O, Mg, S, Fe and Ni, are relatively weak. However, the computed binding energies for these elements are still far stronger than the energies associated with dust temperatures typical of the ambient interstellar medium (ISM), suggesting that silicate grains are generally stable against sublimation. We estimate sublimation temperatures for silicate grains to range from 1600 K to 3000K depending on assumed grain size and lifetime. These binding energies on silicate dust grains, estimated from first principles for the first time, provide invaluable input to models of dust evolution and dust-catalyzed chemical reactions in the interstellar medium.

 - **Abstract**
 The galaxy LEDA 1313424 has recently been discovered to have nine rings [1]. The authors of the discovery paper interpret the rings to be the result of the passing of a smaller galaxy through the center of the LEDA galaxy 56 Myr ago. We point out several difficulties with this interpretation and propose instead that the rings of LEDA are the imprint upon baryonic matter of caustic rings of dark matter. Caustic rings of dark matter, with the pattern of radii observed in the LEDA galaxy, form if the dark matter is axions. Because they move slowly (LEDA's 70 kpc ring, for example, has speed 6.6 km/s) caustic rings of dark matter are plausible sites for the star formation observed in LEDA.

 - **Abstract**
 Carbon-deficient giants (CDGs) are a rare and chemically peculiar class of stars whose origins remain under active investigation. We present an asteroseismic analysis of the entire known CDG population, selecting 129 stars observed by $Kepler$, K2, and TESS to obtain seismic constraints. We detect solar-like oscillations in 43 CDGs. By measuring $\nu_{\rm max}$ and applying seismic scaling relations, we determine precise masses for these stars, finding that 79\% are low-mass ($M \lesssim 2~M_\odot$). The luminosity distribution is bimodal, and the CDGs separate into three chemically and evolutionarily distinct groups, characterized by clear trends in sodium and CNO abundances, $\alpha$-element enhancement, and kinematics. We find that two of these groups are only distinguished by their initial $\alpha$-element abundances, thus effectively reducing the number of groups to two. Lithium enrichment is common across all groups, linking CDGs to lithium-rich giants and suggesting a shared evolutionary origin. We find that spectroscopic $\log g$ is systematically offset from seismic values. Group~1 CDG patterns are most consistent with formation through core He-flash mixing, while the more massive and more chemically processed Groups~2 and 2$\alpha$ likely formed through mergers involving helium white dwarfs, possibly in hierarchical triples. Pollution from AGB stars appears very unlikely, given the unchanged [C+N+O] abundance across all groups.

 - **Abstract**
 We discovered a hyperluminous dust-obscured galaxy with mysterious blue-excess emission (BlueDOG) in rest-frame UV of its spectral energy distribution (SED) from a multi-wavelength survey in the AKARI Deep Field - South (ADF-S). We present the results of SED analysis with multiwavelength photometric data and spectroscopic analysis, observed with Gemini-S/GMOS, FLAMINGOS-2, to explore the origin of blue-excess emission of a hyperluminous BlueDOG, ADFS-KMTDOG-102, at z=2.6. The SED analysis shows that this BlueDOG is a highly massive system (log $M_{*}$/$M_\odot=12.3$) with substantial extinction. Additionally, the proportion of the old stellar population exceeds that of the young stellar population, which suggests stellar evolution cumulated from the early universe. The mass of supermassive black hole (SMBH) estimated using the extinction-corrected broad H$\rm\alpha$ emission line yields log $M_{\rm BH}$/$M_\odot$=10.2. We discuss the similarity between the BlueDOG and 'Little Red Dots' (LRDs), recently discovered with the James Webb Space Telescope, showing SED shapes remarkably similar to those of LRDs. The UV emission line ratios indicate that the emission lines are primarily powered by the central active galactic nuclei (AGN). In contrast, the origin of the blue-excess UV continuum remains ambiguous, since both recent star formation and AGN-induced scattered light are viable explanations, based on the results from the SED fitting and scattered light modeling.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the discovery of a vertical velocity anomaly (VVA) in the stellar component of the Galactic disk, consistent with the impact of a dark, ultra-compact dwarf galaxy (UCD)-sized object plunging into the Milky Way. The anomaly spatially coincides with a suite of gaseous disturbances -- including an \Hone\ void, a molecular shell (CO 16.134--0.553), and a vertical \Hone\ filament -- previously interpreted as signatures of a dark matter subhalo (DMSH) collision. Analysis of Gaia DR2 astrometry reveals a statistically significant vertical velocity dip co-located with these features, supporting a dynamical origin. The absence of a luminous source at the filament's terminus suggests a dark or failed UCD. These results provide rare observational evidence for a low-mass DMSH, with implications for the substructure of dark matter halos and constraints on the $\Lambda$CDM model.

 - **Abstract**
 Protoplanetary nebulae (PPNs) represent a critical evolutionary bridging stage between the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) and planetary nebula (PN) stages. Their dynamical structures provide key insights into late stellar evolution. Here, we report CO and $^{13}$CO imaging observations of the carbon-rich PPN IRAS 06530$-$0213, a source exhibiting the unidentified 21 micron emission band, conducted with the Northern Extended Millimeter Array (NOEMA). The CO maps reveal a spherical halo (diameter $\sim10''$) surrounding a central barrel-shaped torus, where the torus displays an inner diameter of $\sim1.5''$ and an outer diameter of $\sim2''$. Through three-dimensional morpho-kinematic modeling with the SHAPE software, we determine that IRAS 06530$-$0213 experienced its final thermal pulse during the AGB phase $\sim6500$ years ago, transitioning into the PPN phase $\sim4500$ years ago. Our analysis indicates that the blue-shifted CO emission, a feature also detected in several other PPNs and PNs previously misattributed to the interstellar clouds, actually originates from the obscuration of the central nebula by the remnant AGB halo. These findings are expected to deepen our understanding of the dynamical structures of PPNs, as well as their pivotal transitional role in the late-stage evolution of low-to-intermediate mass stars.
#### The evolutionary and asteroseismic imprints of mass accretion. The 10 M$_\odot$ $β$ Cep case study

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the structural and asteroseismic consequences of mass accretion in massive stars within close binary systems. Using MESA, we model the evolution of the 10 M$_{\odot}$ accretor through and after a Roche lobe overflow phase. In addition to changing the surface composition of the star, mass accretion also significantly modifies the internal structure by expanding the convective core and altering chemical stratification near the core-envelope boundary. This partial core rejuvenation creates a distinct mean molecular weight gradient and leaves a persistent local density modulation. In the late stages of mass transfer, changes in density and sound-speed profiles become apparent and influence stellar oscillations. We analyse the asteroseismic properties of the post-mass transfer models compared to single stars of the same mass and central hydrogen abundance. In the gravity mode regime, the altered Brunt-Väisälä frequency leads to period spacing patterns with larger amplitudes and phase shifts. For low and intermediate-order pressure modes, we find systematic frequency deviations linked to changes in the sound-speed profile. Weight function analyses confirm that these differences arise primarily from structural modifications near the convective core boundary. Furthermore, small frequency separations, sensitive to localised sound-speed gradients, reveal periodic variations attributable to the density discontinuity at the convective core edge. The accretor exhibits a larger sound-speed gradient integral and a longer acoustic radius ratio compared to the single star, consistent with its expanded core. Our results demonstrate that mass accretion imprints measurable asteroseismic signatures on both gravity and pressure modes. These signatures provide powerful diagnostics for identifying post-interaction stars, for refining stellar age and structure estimates in binary systems.

 - **Abstract**
 The behavior of lithium (Li) in Population I main sequence stars challenges standard stellar theory. Two phenomena stand out: the solar Li problem which extends to Li depletion in solar analogs and the Li dip observed in mid-F stars within open clusters. Building on the meridional circulation-driven radial mixing framework previously developed to explain Li-enriched red clump stars, we explore its relevance to Li depletion on the main sequence. First, our models reproduce the observed $A(\text{Li})$-Age correlation in solar analogs. Through detailed isochrone analysis, we find good agreement between the simulated and observed $A(\text{Li})$-$T_{\text{eff}}$ relationships within the solar analog parameter space. However, the predicted solar Li abundance ($\sim 1.5\,\text{dex}$) is still higher than current solar measurements. Second, our models partially explain the Li dip phenomenon in mid-F cluster stars. The models accurately reproduce Li distributions on the cool side of the Li dip in most clusters and capture the Li behaviors on the hot side observed in systems like the Hyades. However, we identify limitations in the models' ability to fully reproduce the dip morphology, particularly due to the rotation velocity distribution of sample stars in this temperature zone.

 - **Abstract**
 Many galactic globular clusters (GCs) contain at least two stellar populations. Recent observational studies found that the radial distributions of the first (P1) and second population (P2) differ in dynamically-young GCs. Since P2 is conventionally assumed to form more centrally concentrated, the rapid mixing (or even inversion) in some GCs but not others is puzzling. We investigate whether dynamical processes specific to certain GCs might cause this. Specifically, we evaluate the expansion of P2 by binary-single interactions in the cluster core and whether these can mix the P1/P2 radial distributions, using a set of toy-models with varying numbers and masses of primordial binaries. We find that even one massive binary star can push the central P2 outwards, but multiple binaries are required to fully mix P1 and P2 within a few relaxation times. We also compare our results to observed properties of mixed young GCs (NGC 4590, 5053, or 5904).
#### The Corona-Australis star-forming region: New insights on its formation history from detailed stellar and disk analysis

 - **Abstract**
 The star-forming complex of Corona Australis (CrA) is one of the closest and most isolated molecular clouds. It belongs to a chain of clusters that show age gradients with distance from the galactic plane. We aim to provide suggestions regarding its formation history by examining the stellar and disk populations, stellar multiplicity, and interstellar absorption. We made a census of stars and disks using Gaia DR3 and infrared data. Interstellar absorption in the direction of each star was derived by comparing SpTy from the literature and Gaia colors. Stellar multiplicity analysis accounts for both direct observation of visual companions (Gaia data and high-contrast imaging) and indirect detection of the presence of companions (eclipsing and spectroscopic binaries, and astrometry). The properties of the disks were obtained from the slopes of the spectral energy distributions. As found in previous studies, the CrA complex can be divided into two regions: a younger region (CrA-Main: 3+/-1Myr) and an older one (CrA-North: 6.7+/-0.3Myr), slightly younger than previously thought. While CrA-Main still appears bound to the gas, CrA-North is unbound and expanding. The stars that belong to CrA-North were in the most compact configuration 3.72Myr ago. At that time, CrA-Main and CrA-North were much closer to each other than they appear now. The fraction of disk-bearing stars is higher in Main than in North, as also expected due to the younger age of CrA-Main. We propose a formation history scenario for the CrA-complex. It started between 15 and 18 Myr ago with SNe explosions in the Upper Centaurus-Lupus complex, followed by a quiescent phase with little star formation. A star formation episode about 7Myr ago formed CrA-North stars. About 3.7Myr ago, a second SN explosion south of CrA-North triggered star formation in CrA-Main. This last SN might have been the origin of the pulsar RX J1856.5-3754.
#### Attempting an accurate age estimate of the open cluster NGC 6633 using CoRoT and Gaia

 - **Abstract**
 Asteroseismology of solar-like oscillations in giant stars allow the derivation of their masses and radii. For members of open clusters, this provides an age of the cluster that should be identical to the one derived from the colour-magnitude diagram, but independent of the uncertainties that are present for that type of analysis. We aim to identify and measure the properties of giant members of the open cluster NGC6633, and combine these with asteroseismic measurements to derive a precise and self-consistent cluster age. Importantly, we wish to constrain the effects of rotational mixing on stellar evolution, since assumptions about internal mixing can have a significant impact on stellar age estimates. We identify five giant members of NGC6633 using photometry and Gaia data, supplemented by spectroscopic literature measurements. These are combined with asteroseismic measurements from CoRoT data and compared to stellar-model isochrones. This constrains the interior mixing to a low level and enables the most precise, accurate and self-consistent age estimate so far for this cluster. Asteroseismology of the giants and the cluster colour-magnitude diagram provide self-consistent masses of the giant members and their radii constrain the stellar interior mixing to a low level. The [C/N] ratios and Li abundances also suggest that rotation has had very little influence on the evolution of the stars in NGC 6633. This results in an age estimate of 0.55+0.05-0.10 Gyr for NGC6633. Four giant members appear to be in the helium-core burning evolutionary phase as also expected from evolutionary timescales. For the largest giant, the evidence remains inconclusive. A comparison to other age and mass estimates for the same stars in the literature uncovers biases for automated age estimates of helium-core burning stars.
#### Probe the missing baryons in cosmic filaments with Fast Radio Bursts

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmic filaments are thought to host a substantial fraction of the missing baryons at redshifts $z<2$. In this study, we probe the baryonic content of these filaments using localized Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs). Filaments are identified from the galaxy distribution in the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) imaging surveys using the DisPerSe algorithm. We find tentative evidence ($\sim 3 \sigma$ significance) for a divergence in the relationship between the dispersion measure (DM) contributed by the intergalactic medium and redshift for FRBs whose signals intersect cosmic filaments compared to those that do not, suggesting excess baryons in the filamentary structures. Assuming an isothermal $\beta$-model gas profile with $\beta=2/3$, this discrepancy is best explained by a central baryon overdensity of $\delta = 20.78$, broadly consistent with previous simulation and observational results. The inferred baryon fraction residing in filaments decreases with redshift, from approximately $0.25-0.30\,\Omega_b$ at $z=0.02$ to $0.15-0.30\,\Omega_b$ at $z=0.5$, and $0.03-0.04\,\Omega_b$ at $z=0.8$. These estimates are likely lower bounds, particularly at $z>0.5$, due to the limited number of identified filaments and localized FRBs at higher redshifts. We also examine various factors that may affect the statistical significance of our results. Our method offers an independent approach to tracing baryons in cosmic filaments and underscores the importance of expanding localized FRB samples and deepening galaxy surveys, which are key steps toward refining these estimates and addressing the missing baryon problem.

 - **Abstract**
 This study examines the communication of astrobiology and the Search for Life Elsewhere (SLE) in academic papers, press releases, and news articles over three decades. Through a quantitative content analysis, it investigates the prevalence of speculations and promises/expectations in these sources, aiming to understand how research results are portrayed and their potential impact on public perception and future research directions. Findings reveal that speculations and promises/expectations are more frequent in news articles and press releases compared to academic papers. Speculations about conditions for life and the existence of life beyond Earth are common, particularly in news articles covering exoplanet research, while promises of life detection are rare. Press releases tend to emphasize the significance of research findings and the progress of the field. Speculations and promises/expectations in news articles often occur without attribution to scientists and in quotes of authors of the studies, and slightly less so in quotes of outside experts. The study highlights the complex dynamics of science communication in astrobiology, where speculations and promises can generate public excitement and influence research funding, but also risk misrepresenting scientific uncertainty and creating unrealistic expectations. It underscores the need for responsible communication practices that acknowledge the speculative dimension of the field while fostering public engagement and informed decision-making.
#### Where are the binaries? -- Searching for blue horizontal-branch stars in binary systems in the inner Galactic Halo

 - **Abstract**
 Blue horizontal-branch (BHB) stars are evolved low-mass objects that have completed their core hydrogen burning main-sequence (MS) stage and have lost significant mass during the red giant phase culminating in the helium flash. We determine the fraction of BHBs in binary systems over a wide range of separations in the inner Galactic Halo to constrain mass-loss mechanisms and evolutionary pathways. Using a catalog of 22,336 BHB candidates from Gaia DR3, we analysed radial velocity variations found in spectra (263 spectra of 89 targets) acquired using the Ondrejov Echelle spectrograph at the Astronomical Institute of the Czech Academy of Sciences together with archival spectra from the Ultraviolet and Visual Echelle Spectrograph (UVES) and Fiber-fed Extended Range Optical Spectrograph (FEROS). We searched for wide common proper motion pairs, binary candidates with enhanced astrometric noise, and binaries with astrometric orbital solutions in Gaia DR3. Archival light curves from Gaia DR3 and the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) were checked for binary induced variations. Synthetic SEDs and binary detection probabilities were modelled to account for selection effects. We find a binary fraction of <2.2%, far lower than the rates for their main-sequence (MS) and red-giant branch (RGB) progenitors (30-50%). This suggests that BHBs are either not descendants of binary systems, or that existing companions do not survive the BHB formation process. The negligible binary fraction implies single-star evolution could dominate BHB formation, contrasting with EHB stars where binarity is critical. Our results challenge models of mass loss on the RGB and highlight the need for alternative mechanisms.

 - **Abstract**
 A sub-parsec supermassive black hole binary at the center of the galaxy 3C 66B is a promising candidate for continuous gravitational wave searches with Pulsar Timing Arrays. In this work, we search for such a signal in the third data release of the Parkes Pulsar Timing Array. Matching our priors to estimates of binary parameters from electromagnetic observations, we find log Bayes factor of 0.22, highlighting that the source can be neither confirmed nor ruled out. We place upper limits at 95% credibility on the chirp mass $M < 6.05 \times 10^{8}\ M_{\odot}$, and on the characteristic strain amplitude $\textrm{log}_{10}(h_0)< -14.44$. This partially rules out the parameter space suggested by electromagnetic observations of 3C 66B. We also independently reproduce the calculation of the chirp mass with the 3-mm flux monitor data from the unresolved core of 3C 66B. Based on this, we outline a new methodology for constructing a joint likelihood of electromagnetic and gravitational-wave data from supermassive black hole binaries. Finally, we suggest that firmly established SMBHB candidates may be treated as standard sirens for complementary constraints on the universe expansion rate. With this, we obtain constraints on the Hubble constant with 3C 66B.

 The day-side atmospheres of the hottest ultra-hot Jupiters (UHJs) have long been subject to speculation about cloud formation, often without direct observational evidence. Here, we present a detailed analysis of the panchromatic day-side emission spectrum of WASP-121b$\unicode{x2014}$one of the hottest known UHJs$\unicode{x2014}$covering a broad wavelength range of $\sim$0.6-5.1$\unicode{x00B5}$m, based on archival JWST observations from NIRISS and NIRSpec/G396H. We report statistically significant detections of several key molecular species, including H$_2$O (13.4 $\sigma$), CO (14.7 $\sigma$), SiO (4.9 $\sigma$), TiO (5.4 $\sigma$), and VO (6.6 $\sigma$), establishing WASP-121b as one of the most thoroughly characterized exoplanetary atmospheres to date. Additionally, we present the robust detection of Titanate (CaTiO$_3$) clouds at 6.7$\sigma$$\unicode{x2014}$the first such detection in any exoplanet atmosphere. Our analysis further reveals strong evidence of TiO depletion, likely due to sequestration into refractory condensates such as Titanate clouds. The precisely constrained molecular abundances yield a super-solar C/O ratio of 0.963$\pm$0.024, a sub-solar Si/O ratio of 0.034$\pm$0.024, and a metallicity of 4.7$_{-1.38}^{+1.99}$ $\times$solar. These findings offer a unique window into the atmospheric chemistry of an extreme UHJ, positioning WASP-121b as a key benchmark for next-generation models of atmospheric evolution and dynamics.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a joint analysis of HI absorption Zeeman measurements and the morphology of filamentary HI emission to investigate the three-dimensional structure of the magnetic field in the diffuse neutral interstellar medium (ISM). Our analysis is based on the Arecibo Millennium Survey and new data from the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST) toward radio sources 3C 75, 3C 207, and 3C 409. Toward 3C 409, we make a 4$\sigma$ Zeeman detection and infer $B_{LOS}$ = 9.1 +/- 1.9$\mu$G, in agreement with Arecibo results. We quantify the dispersion of HI filaments at the locations and velocities of Zeeman components using GALFA-HI narrow-channel emission maps. Focusing on a subsample of 42 spectrally distinct components, we find a weak but statistically significant positive correlation (Spearman r = 0.3, $p = 0.01$) between $|B_{LOS}|$ and the circular variance of HI filament orientation angles. To examine its origin, we characterize the environments probed by HI absorption using dust emission, 3D dust maps, OH absorption, and CO emission. We find evidence that existing HI absorption Zeeman measurements trace magnetic fields that are coherent on parsec scales, probe primarily local gas ($100$-$500$ pc, often at distances consistent with the Local Bubble wall), and exhibit systematic differences in the magnitude of $B_{LOS}$. We attribute the correlation between Zeeman measurements and filamentary HI morphology to large-scale variations in magnetic field strength and/or inclination angle across different Galactic environments, which could arise due to the Local Bubble geometry or enhanced total field strength in denser regions.

 - **Abstract**
 The astrophysics of Long GRB (LGRB) progenitors as well as possible cosmological evolution in their properties still poses many open questions. Previous studies suggest that the LGRB rate density (LGRB-RD) follows the cosmic star formation rate density (SFRD) only at high-z and attribute this to the metallicity evolution of progenitor stars. For low z, opinions differ on whether the uptick in the LGRB RD is due to a distinct class of low-luminosity GRBs or perhaps even a different progenitor subclass. To investigate these questions, we utilize data from the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory and ground-based observatories (redshift). To test the hypothesis that the observations can be mapped (with/without evolution) to the well-established cosmic SFRD, we consider three cases: no evolution, beaming angle evolution, and a simple power-law evolution. The comparison shows that the 'no evolution' case can be ruled out. Our study highlights that the beaming angle evolution or the simple power law evolution are also not sufficient to obtain a good match between the LGRB-RD and SFRD. Rather, the inclusion of multiple evolving properties of LGRBs in combination appears to be required to match the two rate densities in their entirety.

 - **Abstract**
 The Keck Observatory Archive (KOA) curates all observational data acquired at the W. M. Keck Observatory. The archive is expected to grow rapidly as complex new instruments are commissioned and as the expectations of archive users have expanded. In response, KOA has implemented a new Python-based, VO-compliant query infrastructure. This work is a continuation of the architectural design and technology selection identified at ADASS 2024. We have deployed real-time ingestion of newly acquired data and a dedicated interface for observers to manage these data. Our ADASS 2024 poster identified the new technologies chosen: Plotly-Dash, a low-code framework that exploits event-driven callbacks to simplify the handling of user interactions; R-tree spatial indexing to speed up spatial searches by x20; a VO-compliant TAP middleware, already in use at the NASA Exoplanet Archive and NEID archive; and mViewer, a visualization engine in the Montage Image Mosaic toolkit that is optimized for astronomy images. These technologies will underpin new services that can be hosted on web pages or in Jupyter notebooks, and when completed, will replace the current query infrastructure. We have completed two new services now in beta release. The first is the Data Discovery Service, a web-based dashboard that returns spatial and temporal queries of the entire archive in seconds. It supports filtering observations by keywords, previewing results in an interactive data grid, and visualizing images, and it offers data downloads. The second is a Jupyter notebook that performs interactive visualization of Keck observations of protostars in the Rho Oph Dark Cloud and uses data from CDS and IRSA, as well as KOA.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a new dynamic formation model of a star, a disk, arms, and companions using a coupled map lattice (CML), a complex systems approach. This CML simulates the viscoelastic and chaotic dynamics and evolution of gas clumps containing a little dust with a minimal set of one Eulerian procedure for the flow formation of gas clumps due to gravitational interaction, and one Lagrangian procedure for the collision and mixture of gas clumps due to viscoelastic advection. Despite its simplicity, this CML successfully obtains four typical astronomical objects consistent with protoplanetary disk observations: a central star, Keplerian disk, spiral arms, and even stellar, substellar, and planetary companions. All these formation processes are truly dynamic, with the central star "starring" in them, and they are not based on the conventional disk gravitational instability but on the central star gravitational instability with high-dimensional chaotic gas ejection, namely the chaotic itinerancy. Of particular note is the process in which diverse companions are formed due to the rapid density increase caused by the intersection of spiral arms. This suggests a novel companion formation scenario that should be called "arm-crossing companion formation" with a view to planet formation, which may overcome the radial drift barrier and angular momentum problem.
#### PSR J0024$-$7204ai: a massive, eccentric binary system in the globular cluster 47 Tucanae

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper we present PSR J0024$-$7204ai, a 13.026-ms binary pulsar recently discovered in the globular cluster 47 Tucanae by the MeerKAT radio telescope. This is the slowest spinning pulsar known in this globular cluster, and has a $\sim1.67$-day orbit with an eccentricity of $e\approx0.18$. Although it was not yet possible to derive an unambiguous phase-connected timing solution, by combining detections obtained from MeerKAT and archival Parkes data we were able to measure the rate of advance of periastron to high significance, $\dot{\omega}$ = 0.1601 $\pm 0.0046$ deg yr$^{-1}$. This value implies a total system mass of $2.41 \pm 0.11\, \mathrm{M}_\odot$ (68.3\% C. L.), which, when combined with the binary mass function, gives a maximum pulsar mass of $\sim 1.7 \, \mathrm{M}_\odot$ and a minimum companion mass of $\sim 0.7\, \mathrm{M}_\odot$. Apart from being the slowest pulsar in 47~Tucanae, its orbit is by far the most eccentric and its companion is the most massive among all known binary pulsars in this globular cluster. One possibility is that system is an old MSP - Carbon-Oxygen White Dwarf binary, whose orbit was perturbed by stellar dynamical interactions in the cluster core. Further follow-up observations of this system will be essential for a more detailed characterisation of this system and its evolution.
#### Three-Dimensional Kinematics of the Oxygen-rich Supernova Remnant G292.0+1.8

 - **Abstract**
 Studying the remnants of young core-collapse supernovae (SNe) can yield insight into the chemical composition of their progenitors and the geometry of the explosions. The supernova remnant (SNR) G292.0+1.8 is one of only three known oxygen-rich SNRs in the galaxy-remnants of core-collapse for which relatively pure fragments of ejecta can be seen. Several dozen ejecta knots from G292.0+1.8 were the subject of a proper motion analysis, based on [O III] 5007-Angstrom images taken over a 22-year baseline by Winkler et al. 2009 (arXiv:0810.1935). They determined that the transverse velocities of the filaments are linearly proportional to their distances from a common expansion center, thus the O-rich filaments have been traveling with little deceleration since the initial supernova event,about 3000 years ago. In this paper, we use optical spectra of G292.0+1.8, all taken from the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory (CTIO), to measure radial velocities for 93 knots. Assuming un-decelerated expansion, as indi- cated by the proper motions, the radial velocity should be proportional to the distance from the center along the line of sight, just as the proper motions are proportional to the transverse distance. Therefore, we can map the three-dimensional structure and kinematics of the SNR. We find that the knots generally follow a broad bi-conical distribution, suggesting that the supernova explosion produced broad jets of ejecta. This structure is similar to that seen in some other young core-collapse supernova remnants.

 - **Abstract**
 Superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) remain an intriguing topic in supernova (SN) transient astronomy. While the majority of SLSNe are shown to be explained by energy streaming from the newly born magnetar, there are others which are powered by different mechanisms. We analyse the pseudo-bolometric light curve of the nearby helium-rich SLSN 2021bnw. We built models and run hydrodynamics radiative-transfer simulations with STELLA. Our best-fit models include 15-22.5 Msun of ejecta enriched with 1.7 Msun of 56 Ni and carrying energy of 4 foe, and colliding w ith 7 Msun of circumstellar matter which match the observed light curve very well. The early data can be explained as cooling of an expanding shell with the mass of 0.5 Msun and kinetic energy of 0.7 foe. We tend to exclude a pulsational pair-instability (PPISN) origin for SLSN 2021bnw. Instead we conclude that SLSN 2021bnw was preferably a core-collapse explosion of a star with the initial mass of not less than 61 Msun aided by magnetorotational effects.
#### On the dynamics, thermodynamics and fine structure of virtual erupting filaments

 - **Abstract**
 It is not fully understood why some solar filaments erupt while others do not. Those that do typically undergo a slow rise followed by an acceleration phase, though this transition requires further investigation. Erupting prominences have been observed to heat up during the acceleration phase, but the origin of this heating remains unclear. Moreover, some coronal mass ejections possess additional fine structure in white-light observations beyond the classical three-part morphology. We aim to elaborate on the dynamics of erupting prominences, investigate the heating during the acceleration phase, and correlate our findings with observations. We employ the open-source MPI-AMRVAC code to solve the 2.5D MHD equations on a coronal domain extending to 300 Mm, using adaptive mesh refinement to attain high resolution. Controlled combinations of footpoint shearing and converging motions applied to an initial magnetic arcade produce erupting flux ropes with self-consistent prominence and coronal rain formation due to thermal instability. We find both non-erupting and erupting cases related to the system energization. Comparison with observations from the AIA Filament Eruption Catalog shows that the slow-rise and impulsive phases are modulated by magnetic reconnection. The transition to acceleration corresponds to an increase in the inflow Alfvén Mach number. Thermal conduction and compressional heating can lead to prominence evaporation. We obtain nested circular fine structure in EUV images of the ejected flux ropes, partly resulting from plasmoid interactions. We conclude that internal heating processes and magnetic reconnection play key roles in the early evolution of CMEs.
#### Calibrating the Tip of the Red Giant Branch and measuring Magellanic Cloud distances to 2% exclusively with Gaia

 - **Abstract**
 We have calibrated the Tip of the Red Giant Branch (TRGB) using our recent catalog of homogeneous, high-accuracy Globular Cluster (GC) distances. The GC distances were determined by a global joint fit to optical period-Wesenheit relations of their member RR Lyrae stars and type-II Cepheids, anchored by trigonometric parallaxes; all data taken from the ESA Gaia mission's (early) third data release (GDR3). Using I-band measurements in 48 GCs from P. Stetson's database, we determined $M_{I,0} = -3.948^{+0.037}_{-0.034}$ mag (1.6% in distance). Calibrating the TRGB using Gaia's homogeneous, space-based RP photometry of 53 GCs, we found $M_{RP,0} = -3.807^{+0.041}_{-0.035}$ mag (1.8%). The stated uncertainties include statistical and systematic effects, including the correlated nature of the GC distances. The robustness of our calibrations is demonstrated via tests against small-number statistics and analysis choices. Specifically, we found no significant metallicity effect for our sample of old, low-metallicity GCs. We measured $\sim 2\%$ distances to the Large (LMC) and Small Magellanic Clouds (SMC), $18.447^{+0.036}_{-0.042}$ mag ($48.9 \pm 0.9$ kpc) and $18.898^{+0.049}_{-0.054}$ mag ($60.2 \pm 1.4$ kpc), respectively, using a single well calibrated photometric system: RP (spectro-)photometry from GDR3. Our new TRGB distances, whose absolute scale derives from Gaia parallaxes, are fully independent of the well-known detached eclipsing binary (DEB) distances and agree with them to within the uncertainties. Combining our new TRGB and existing DEB distances, we illustrate how additional constraints may be incorporated in the Local Distance Network and obtain $H_0 = 73.52 \pm 0.80$ km/s/Mpc. Expected improvements due to the upcoming fourth Gaia data release are discussed.

 - **Abstract**
 We address the challenge, commonly referred to as the cosmological averaging problem, of relating the large-scale evolution of an inhomogeneous Universe to that predicted by a homogeneous matter distribution in theories of gravity with nonminimal matter-gravity couplings. To this end, we focus on the class of $f(R,T)$ models defined by $f(R,T)=R+F(T)$, which provide a simple yet theoretically consistent realization of nonminimal matter-gravity interactions and can be reformulated as general relativity minimally coupled to a modified matter Lagrangian. Using nonstandard global monopole solutions as a toy model for realistic particles, we show that the spatial average of $F$ typically differs significantly from $F$ evaluated at the spatially averaged trace of $T$, implying that homogeneous cosmological models generally fail to capture the correct large-scale dynamics of the Universe. We further show that dust in these theories generally exhibits a non-vanishing proper pressure. Our results underscore the necessity of properly accounting for spatial averaging when modeling cosmology in theories with nonminimal matter-gravity couplings.

 - **Abstract**
 Carbon stars on the asymptotic giant branch are major contributors to galactic dust enrichment, with gas mass-loss rates up to 1e-4 Msun/yr. We present a homogeneous spectral energy distribution analysis of the Gaia DR3 Golden Sample of carbon stars in the Milky Way and Magellanic Clouds. Our dataset includes 14,747 sources with multi-band photometry from Gaia, 2MASS, and WISE, combined with recent distance and extinction estimates. For a subsample of 2,494 Mira variables, we model multi-band light curves to derive accurate mean magnitudes. Stellar and circumstellar parameters are obtained by fitting observations with a large grid of synthetic spectra computed with the DUSTY radiative transfer code using COMARCS atmospheres. We derive effective temperature, optical depth, and gas mass-loss rate for each source. The distributions peak around Teff = 3150 K, with mass-loss rates spanning 1e-11 to 1e-4 Msun/yr and inner dust temperatures near 1000 K. We find a correlation between variability amplitude and mass-loss rate. This framework provides a statistically robust view of carbon stars across environments with different metallicities. Apparent environmental dependencies are influenced by luminosity distributions and selection effects rather than purely intrinsic metallicity differences. The combined Gaia and WISE selection limits the detection of both highly obscured and faint Magellanic Cloud sources, but the observed trends remain significant within the sampled populations.
#### An observational test of the plasma lensing effect using QSOs with and without MgII absorption

 - **Abstract**
 Radio wave propagation can be perturbed by compact ionized gas clumps through plasma lensing, which induces frequency dependent magnification and may distort the observed number counts of background sources. The quasar (QSO) number densities are a powerful probe for understanding the effects of intervening material. Absorption lines in QSO spectra reveal the presence of interstellar and intergalactic gas, which can change observed fluxes through dust extinction and plasma lensing. By combining observations from radio (VLASS), infrared (WISE), and optical bands (DESI), we assembled a sample of QSOs: ~4000 sources with MgII absorbers, and ~12, 000 non-absorbers. In the radio band, the MgII sample shows a moderate excess at the bright end of the flux distribution, which is broadly consistent with plasma lensing predications. In the optical, the MgII sample turns over at higher g-band fluxes and exhibits a steeper decline at the faint end than the non-MgII sample. Control samples were constructed by matching in redshift, infrared (W1), and optical (g) luminosities. In these comparisons, the radio excess becomes less prominent, suggesting that the apparent magnification may not be robust evidence for plasma lensing. Nevertheless, a weak contribution cannot be ruled out, especially given residual excess observed at the bright end relative to the non-MgII sample. Dust extinction along the line-of-sight remains a plausible alternative. Regardless of the dominant mechanism, the multi-wavelength differences offer a valuable probe of the physical state of the intervening medium.

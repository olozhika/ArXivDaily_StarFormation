#### Tidally driven inertial waves enhance eccentricity damping and spin evolution in planets and stars

 - **Abstract**
 Tidal interactions influence the orbital motions of binary star systems and extrasolar planets alike. Tides also affect stellar and planetary rotation rates. We demonstrate that in addition to altering spin synchronization and pseudosynchronization, tidally driven inertial waves in the convective envelopes of low-mass stars and gas giant planets can enhance tidal eccentricity damping. Analytically, we find that eccentricity damping by inertial waves can be orders of magnitude faster than equilibrium tides, independent of any eddy viscosity prescription. We use simplified numerical experiments to demonstrate this enhancement, and to explore the effects of different mixing length treatments of convective turbulence, as well as a spin-down torque from magnetic braking. These calculations demonstrate that tidally driven inertial waves can produce an extended cool core of nearly circular binaries, helping to reconcile a longstanding discrepancy between observed and predicted main-sequence binary circularization. Our calculations additionally suggest that tidally driven inertial waves may leave identifiable signatures in the ratios of orbital to rotation periods for stellar binaries, including synchronous and sub-synchronous rotation periods reminiscent of populations identified in Kepler, TESS, and Gaia data.
#### WOCS XCIII: NGC 7789: the Evolution of Li, Stellar Rotation, and Extended Main Sequence Turnoffs

 - **Abstract**
 Precision UBVRI photometry of NGC 7789 is combined with Gaia data to map reddening variations across the cluster face. HYDRA spectra, Gaia astrometry, and isochrone fitting constrain the absolute reddening, apparent modulus, and age to E(B-V) = 0.30 +/- 0.02, (m-M)=12.51 +/- 0.06, and 1.46 +/- 0.02 Gyr for [Fe/H] between -0.2 and solar; the spectroscopic [Fe/H] = -0.13 +/- 0.068 (MAD) from 156 single-star members. Corrections for variable reddening reduce the scatter in the unevolved main sequence below the turnoff. A(Li) is derived for only single star members from the G-dwarf Li-Plateau to the tip of the red giant branch. Giants separate into two distinct groups, probable first-ascent giants with detectable Li that declines with evolution toward the red giant tip and stars within the clump and the asymptotic giant branch which only exhibit upper limits. A(Li) structure from the turnoff to the unevolved main sequence, including the Li-Dip, and the presence of an extended color spread among the upper main sequence stars are attributed to the V_ROT distribution, indicating the wall of the Li-Dip as the true hot boundary of the Kraft break. Differences in the color-magnitude diagram topology of NGC 7789 and NGC 752 are explored and attributed to differences in the individual cluster V_ROT distributions. Prior indications that main sequence stars more massive than the Li-Dip evolve redward across the Li-Wall, undergoing rotational spindown and Li depletion like stars within the Li-Dip, are confirmed.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a new spectroscopic pipeline designed to analyse large numbers of hot massive stars homogeneously. The pipeline has been developed to utilise large grids of FASTWIND non-LTE, line blanketed models in which spherical geometry is adopted, and uniquely incorporates model errors. The pipeline has been applied to three contemporary datasets involving Very Large Telescope spectroscopy of OB stars in the Magellanic Clouds, namely the VLT FLAMES Tarantula Survey (VFTS), XShooting-ULLYSES (XShootU) and Binaries at Low Metallicity (BLOeM). We find satisfactory agreement with previous detailed temperatures and surface gravities, although strong nebular contamination, binarity and disk emission from OBe stars are problematic for automatic pipelines, requiring visual inspection of fits. The tool has been incorporated into the pipeline for the VISTA/4MOST pipeline.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. The polarized thermal emission from interstellar dust offers a valuable tool for probing both the dust and the magnetic field in the interstellar medium (ISM). However, existing observations only yield the total amount of dust emission along the line of sight (LoS), with no information on its LoS distribution. Aims. We present a new method designed to give access to the LoS distribution of the dust emission, both in terms of intensity and polarization. Methods. We relied on three kinematic gas tracers (HI, 12CO, and 13CO emission lines) to identify the different clouds present along the LoS. We decomposed the measured intensity of the dust emission, $I_d$, into separate contributions from these clouds. We performed a similar decomposition of the measured Stokes parameters for linear polarization, $Q_d$ and $U_d$, to derive the polarization parameters of the different clouds, and from this we inferred the clouds' magnetic field orientations. Results. We applied our method to a $3~{\rm deg}^2$ region of the sky, centered on $(l,b) = (139°30',-3°16')$ and exhibiting signs of star formation activity. We found this region to be dominated by an extended and bright cloud with nearly horizontal magnetic field, as expected from the nearly vertical polarization angles measured by Planck. More importantly, we detected the presence of two smaller, depolarizing molecular clouds with very different magnetic field orientations in the plane of the sky ($\simeq 65°$ and $\simeq 45°$ from the horizontal). This is a novel and viable result, which cannot be directly read off the Planck polarization maps. Conclusions. The application of our method to the G139 region convincingly demonstrates the need to complement 2D polarization maps with 3D kinematic information when looking for reliable estimates of magnetic field orientations.
#### TRIShUL: Technique for Reconstructing magnetic Interstellar Structure Using starLight polarization

 - **Abstract**
 We present a novel technique to decompose line-of-sight (LOS) stellar polarization as a function of distance, aimed at reconstructing three dimensional (3D) plane-of-sky (POS) magnetic structures in the interstellar medium (ISM). The method assumes that the observed polarization arises from discrete, thin dust layers located at varying distances along the LOS. Using a simple frequentist framework, it identifies structural changes in the distance-sorted cumulative Mahalanobis distance of Stokes parameters (q and u) to detect the locations of dust layers and estimate their associated physical properties (parallax and Stokes parameters) necessary to construct 3D maps. We benchmark the method using mock datasets representative of high-Galactic-latitude regions, incorporating realistic Gaia parallax uncertainties and polarization expected from the upcoming Pasiphae survey. Tests show that the method reliably recovers dust cloud distances and polarization properties when the polarization exceeds 0.1%, and the effective background-star fraction is greater than 10% in samples of about 345 stars. The dependence on background fraction decreases as the intrinsic polarization amplitude of the dust field increases. We apply our method to existing polarization data from two illustrative sightlines, one at intermediate-high Galactic latitude and one near the Galactic plane, with known tomographic solutions, finding excellent agreement with the literature and demonstrating its accuracy across both regions. Comparing with the BISP-1 approach, both methods effectively recover dust cloud properties, but our approach is prior-free and computationally more efficient in determining the optimal number of clouds along the LOS. These advantages make it flexible and broadly applicable for multi-layer dust cloud reconstruction for the upcoming era of large-scale stellar polarization surveys.
#### Ram pressure shaping HVC droplets -- FAST HI observations of HVC AC-III and theoretical interpretation

 - **Abstract**
 FAST HI observations reveal unprecedented internal structures of the high-velocity cloud AC-III, which is found to consist of several coherent subclumps (D1--D6) with nearly constant line widths of $\sim 20~\mathrm{km~s^{-1}}$, while the global velocity spread ranges from $-220$ to $-180~\mathrm{km~s^{-1}}$. These subclumps exhibit parabolic morphologies, consistent with ram-pressure--confined droplets, with their heads tending to point toward the Galactic plane. A steady-state model reproduces both the morphology and the observed exponential density profiles. The tip density reaches $\sim 2~\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$, implying an ambient medium density of $\sim 10^{-3}~\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$, in agreement with the Galactic warm ionized medium at a distance of $\sim 5$~kpc. Deviations from symmetric droplet shapes, along with internal patterns such as strip-like ridges, rings, and holes, indicate rich internal dynamics. In particular, the observations are consistent with fluid loops forming inside the droplets in response to interactions between neighboring subclumps. These loops can generate ring-like dynamic patterns and drive secondary turbulence, sustaining long-lived internal motions. An intermediate-velocity component ($-150$ to $-100~\mathrm{km~s^{-1}}$) exhibits a shell-like morphology aligned with the head of AC-III, possibly shaped by pressure interactions mediated by the WIM. Overall, we suggest that HVC AC-III is entering the Galactic WIM layer and being sculpted by ram pressure into a droplet-like morphology, providing a valuable case for studying the structure formation, turbulence origin, and dynamic evolution of HVCs, as well as the physical properties of the ambient medium.
#### Direct Numerical Simulations of Oxygen-Flame-Driven Deflagration-to-Detonation Transition in Type Ia Supernovae

 - **Abstract**
 We present direct numerical simulations demonstrating deflagration-to-detonation transition (DDT) driven by oxygen flames in Type Ia supernova progenitors. Using the Castro hydrodynamics code coupled with the ``aprox13'' 13-isotope nuclear network, we simulate combustion in isolated fuel regions where oxygen flames trail carbon flames. In a fiducial one-dimensional run at $\rho_{0}=3.5\times10^{7}\ \mathrm{g\ cm^{-3}}$ we observe spontaneous DDT of the oxygen flame via the Zel'dovich gradient mechanism when the carbon-oxygen separation reaches $\sim 10\ \mathrm{km}$. The oxygen detonation then captures the carbon flame and triggers a stable carbon detonation. Systematic one-dimensional parameter scans show that successful carbon DDT requires upstream densities in the range $(3.1$--$3.6)\times10^{7}\ \mathrm{g\ cm^{-3}}$ and a minimum carbon-flame thickness of $\gtrsim 20\ \mathrm{m}$. Two-dimensional simulations confirm DDT and demonstrate that the multidimensional cellular structure of the oxygen detonation can promote carbon detonation at somewhat lower densities than in one dimension. These results provide direct numerical evidence that oxygen-flame-driven DDT is physically plausible in turbulent white-dwarf environments and underscore the importance of multidimensional effects for Type Ia supernova explosion modeling.

 - **Abstract**
 We present theoretical predictions of the born-again scenario for post-asymptotic giant-branch stars. An extensive model grid for born-again objects has been constructed, particularly including models for the Very Late Thermal Pulse with and without convective overshooting, and also including models for the Late Thermal Pulse. We constructed a large parameter space to analyze the dependencies of the born-again model on core mass, hydrogen-envelope mass, and overshoot parameters, and we analyzed how changes in these parameters affect the models' evolution. We applied our grid of models to interpret observations of DY\,Cen, a star exhibiting characteristics similar to confirmed born-again stars. We compared DY\,Cen with models from multiple aspects, including heating rate, evolutionary tracks, and surface abundances. Ultimately, we concluded that none of our born-again models could match all of the observed properties of DY\,Cen, especially its surface chemistry; DY\,Cen is therefore an unlikely born-again star.
#### The SOMA MM Survey. I. An Astrochemical Census of Massive Protostars

 - **Abstract**
 During massive star formation, dense gas undergoes chemical evolution, producing both simple and complex organic molecules (COMs) characteristic of hot molecular cores. How this evolution depends on protostellar physical properties remains unclear. We investigate the chemical content of 22 well-studied massive protostars from the SOFIA Massive (SOMA) Star Formation survey, aiming to identify correlations between chemical and physical parameters. We analyzed Atacama Compact Array and Total Power 1.3 mm (Band 6) data, deriving column densities, line widths, and excitation temperatures of multiple molecular species by modeling detected lines under local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) using MADCUBA. Spectra show 35 species, from simple molecules (e.g., CO, SO, SiO) to complex organic molecules (COMs), with seven sources exhibiting high chemical complexity (> 100 transitions). Average excitation temperatures vary across the sample: $T_\text{ex}>100~\text{K}$ for eight sources, $50-100~\text{K}$ for four, and $T_\text{ex} < 50~\text{K}$ for the remainder. Sources with $T_\text{ex} < 50~\text{K}$ trace lukewarm, chemically simple gas, while those with $T_\text{ex}>100~\text{K}$ indicate the presence of typical hot cores where thermal desorption is efficient, resulting in line-rich spectra. Comparing these chemical properties with the bolometric luminosity to envelope mass ratio ($L_\text{bol}/M_\text{env}$), an evolutionary tracer, we find tentative correlations with line widths, excitation temperature, and column densities. These data provide important constraints for chemodynamical models of massive protostellar cores.

 - **Abstract**
 Unveiling massive stars' internal structure and the physical origin and efficiency of the internal mixing processes? It is now possible using the apsidal motion rate in close eccentric binaries! The apsidal motion rate depends on the tidal interactions occurring between the stars and is proportional to k2, a measure of the star's inner density profile. Confronting standard stellar models with observations reveals the famous k2-discrepancy: models predict too high a k2 for the stars, that is to say, stars with too low a density contrast between their core and envelope. We built bespoke GENEC stellar evolution models including tidal mixing for the twin massive binary HD 152248. The models reveal the instabilities allowing to reproduce the stellar density profiles: advecto-diffusive models better reproduce k2 than magnetic models. A large overshooting is necessary to converge towards the observed k2, yet alone is not sufficient. While a change in metallicity or mass-loss rate has no significant impact on k2, a larger initial helium abundance allows us to better reproduce the k2. Yet, a super-solar helium abundance is not observationally supported. Our analyses highlight the need for a process in the stars that slows down the radial expansion.

 - **Abstract**
 Direct detection of intercluster filaments is challenging due to their low surface density, resulting in a weak deflection field. We present weak-lensing detections of intercluster filaments using wide-field Dark Energy Camera (DECam) observations from the Local Volume Complete Cluster Survey (LoVoCCS). A matched-filter method was applied to identify filamentary structures in three nearby ($z < 0.1$) systems centered on Abell 401, Abell 2029, and Abell 3558. We discover two prominent filaments ($\geq 4\sigma$) in each system, with the strongest detections ($6.4\sigma - 7.3\sigma$) around Abell 401 and Abell 2029. In particular, we report the first robust weak-lensing detections $(>5 \sigma)$ of the intercluster bridges connecting the cluster pairs Abell 401/399, Abell 2029/2033, Abell 2029/SIG, and Abell 3558/3556. Adopting a filament convergence model motivated by numerical simulations, we infer the maximum convergence ($\kappa_0$) and characteristic width ($h_{\mathrm{c}}$) for all six filaments, yielding $\kappa_0 \sim 0.015 - 0.053$ and $h_{\mathrm{c}} \sim 0.11 - 0.45 \ \mathrm{Mpc}$. The performance of the matched-filter technique is validated using mock shear catalogs and further tested on a null field around Abell 2351. We also explore the potential of using the B-mode lensing signal of filaments to suppress cluster-induced shear contamination. These results demonstrate the feasibility of directly mapping dark matter filaments with current and future wide-field weak-lensing datasets.

 - **Abstract**
 An understanding of the assembly history of the complex star cluster Omega Centauri has long been sought after, with many studies separating the stars on the color-magnitude diagram into multiple groupings across small magnitude ranges. Utilizing the oMEGACat combined astro-photometric and spectroscopic dataset we parse 14 subpopulations from the upper red-giant branch to below the main-sequence turnoff. We combine our results with previous works to estimate the age and age spread of each population. We find that the chemically enhanced (P2) populations are all ~1 Gyr younger (~11.6 Gyr old) and have significantly higher intrinsic age spreads (0.6 Gyr) than the primordial (P1) populations (~12.6 Gyr old, 0.3 Gyr spread), with the intermediate (Im) populations falling in between the two. Additionally, we connect for the first time the Chromosome Diagram to the two-stream age-metallicity relation, allowing us to link the P1 and P2 stars to the distinct star formation tracks, proposed to be in-situ and ex-situ contributions to the cluster's assembly. Our results are consistent with some suggested formation models and rule out others but no current model can explain all observed features of the subpopulations.
#### The light curve model fitting of LMC Cepheids: MESA-RSP versus Stellingwerf's code predictions

 - **Abstract**
 A major challenge in modeling classical Cepheids is the treatment of convection, particularly its complex interplay with pulsation. This inherently three-dimensional process is typically approximated in one-dimensional hydrocodes using dimensionless turbulent convection (TC) free parameters. Calibrating these parameters is essential for reproducing key observational features such as light-curve amplitudes, secondary bumps, and the red edge of the instability strip. In this work, we calibrate TC parameters adopted in the publicly available MESA-RSP code through comparison with both observational data of classical Cepheids and stellar parameter constraints from the Stellingwerf code. We compute multi-band (V, I, and Ks) MESA-RSP light curves for 18 observed Large Magellanic Cloud Cepheids, using stellar parameters determined from the Stellingwerf code. By fine-tuning the mixing-length and eddy viscosity parameters, we calibrate the TC treatment in MESA-RSP. We then compare the resulting period-luminosity (PL), period-radius (PR), and period-mass-radius (PMR) relations with predictions from the Stellingwerf models. We successfully reproduce multi-band light curves and obtain PL, PR, and PMR relations consistent with Ragosta et al. (2019). While in broad agreement with previous work, we explicitly identify distinct mass-luminosity (ML) relations for fundamental-mode and first-overtone Cepheids for the first time. This suggests that the macroscopic processes affecting the ML relation depend on stellar mass and/or effective temperature range. Although our study focuses on the calibration of TC parameters, we do not find a single set of parameter values that reproduces all light curves. No statistically significant correlation is found between stellar properties and convection parameters, although subtle trends with period and effective temperature may be present.
#### Neon is an inhibitor of CO hydrogenation in pre-stellar core conditions

 - **Abstract**
 Neon (Ne) is the fifth most abundant element in the Universe. Because it is chemically inert, it has never been considered in astrochemical models that studied molecular evolution. In the cold dark environments of pre-stellar cores, where the temperatures are below 10 K, Ne can condense onto the surface of interstellar grains. We investigated the effect of Ne on the production of formaldehyde (H$_2$CO) and methanol (CH$_3$OH) through carbon monoxide (CO) hydrogenation on different cold surfaces. We highlight its role in conditions corresponding to pre-stellar cores. In an ultra-high vacuum system, we conducted two types of experiments. The first experiment involved the co-deposition of CO and H atoms with or without Ne. The second experiment involved depositing a monolayer of CO and separately a monolayer of Ne (or vice versa), followed by bombarding the layers with hydrogen atoms. Additionally, we used a gas-grain chemical code to simulate a pre-stellar core and determine where Ne can affect the chemistry. The presence of Ne on the surface significantly inhibits CO hydrogenation at temperatures below 12 K. In the co-deposition experiments, we observed a 38% decrease in the H$_2$CO production at 11 K when the quantity of Ne in the mixture was lower than a monolayer. At 10 K and with one monolayer in the mixture, the production decreased to 77%, and it reached 91% for a few monolayers of Ne in the mixture at 9 K. While the decrease in CH$_3$OH formation is still notable, it is less pronounced: 43% at 11 K, 61% at 10 K, and 77% at 9 K. Experiments with stacked layers revealed that the CO layer decay varies slightly when the Ne layer is positioned above or below it. This observation indicates that Ne and CO create a mixture in which Ne can diffuse and stabilize at the surface, which isolates CO molecules from the accreting H atoms.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a fully integrated model of comet evolution that couples thermal and compositional processes with dynamical processes continuously, from formation to present-day activity. The combined code takes into account changes in orbital parameters that define the heliocentric distance as a function of time, which is fed into the thermal/compositional evolution code. The latter includes a set of volatile species, gas flow through the porous interior, crystallization of amorphous ice, sublimation and refreezing of volatiles in the pores. We follow the evolution of three models, with radii of 2, 10 and 50 km for 4.6 Gyr, through different dynamical epochs, starting in the vicinity of Neptune, moving to the Oort Cloud and after a long sojourn there, back inward to the planetary region. The initial composition includes a mixture of CO, CO2 ices, amorphous water ice with trapped CO and CO2, and this http URL find that the CO ice is completely depleted in the small object, but preserved in the larger ones from a depth of 500 m to the center, while the CO2 and the amorphous ice are entirely preserved. Of crucial importance is the change in CO abundance profiles during the cooling phase, as the objects migrate to the OC. Upon return from the Oort Cloud, the activity is driven by CO sublimation at large heliocentric distances (up to 50 au), by CO2 inward of 13 au and by gas released from crystallizing amorphous ice at about 7 au. We test the effect of radioactive heating by long-lived isotopes and find that it is negligible. Considering sub-solar temperatures and limited active areas, we show that CO2 production rates can exceed the detection limit as far out as 25 au.

 - **Abstract**
 Galaxy mergers trigger starburst activity and galactic outflows that enrich the circumgalactic medium, profoundly impacting galaxy evolution. These phenomena are intrinsically linked to the physical conditions of the medium, which is permeated by magnetic (B) fields affecting its transport and dynamics. Here, we spatially resolve, $0.24$" (96 pc), the B-fields in the dusty and molecular outflows of Arp 220, the closest ($78$ Mpc) Ultra-Luminous Infrared Galaxy hosting two interacting nuclei, denoted as East and West. We perform ALMA $870~\mu$m dust continuum polarization and CO(3-2) emission line polarization, and report the first detection of CO(3-2) emission line polarization through the Goldreich-Kylafis effect in an outflow. Dust polarization shows that Arp 220 E has a spiral-like B-field on the disk with a linear polarization fraction of $0.4\pm0.1$% that may produce the detected circular polarization passing through foreground aligned dust grains. Arp 220 W reveals a B-field parallel to the red- and blueshifted outflows in both the dust and emission line polarization maps. The outflows show a dust polarization of $0.2$%, while the CO(3-2) emission line polarization is $1-2$% at $4-6\sigma$ significance across independent velocity channels. A highly polarized ($3-5$%) dusty bridge has a B-field orientation of $\sim110^{\circ}$ connecting both nuclei. Mean B-field strengths of $1.6$ mG and $8$ mG for the blue- and redshifted outflows, respectively, are estimated. These strong B-fields are attributed to amplification by compression in nuclear clouds and supernova remnants. This amplified B-field is likely sustained by the turbulent kinetic energy in the outflow and may be critical in directing the transport of metals and cosmic rays into the circumgalactic medium.

 - **Abstract**
 The properties of stars and planets are shaped by the initial conditions of their natal clouds. However, the spatial scales over which the initial conditions can exert a significant influence are not well constrained. We report the first evidence for parsec-scale spatial correlations of stellar magnetospheric inclinations ($i_{\rm mag}$), observed in the Lupus low-mass star forming region. Applying consensus clustering with a hierarchical density-based clustering algorithm, we demonstrate that the detected spatial dependencies are stable against perturbations by measurement uncertainties. The $i_{\rm mag}$ correlation scales are on the order of ~3 pc, which aligns with the typical scales of the Lupus molecular cloud filaments. Our results reveal a connection between large-scale forces -- in the form of expanding shells from the Upper Scorpius and Upper-Centaurus-Lupus regions -- and sub-au scale system configurations. We find that Lupus has a non-uniform $i_{\rm mag}$ distribution and suggest that this results from the preferential elongation of protostellar cores along filamentary axes. Non-uniformity would have significant implications for exoplanet occurrence rate calculations, so future work should explore the longevity of these biases driven by the star-cloud connection.

 - **Abstract**
 The 21-cm signal from the epoch of cosmic dawn ($z \sim 10-30$) offers a powerful probe of new physics. One standard mechanism for constraining decaying dark matter from 21-cm observations relies on heating of the intergalactic medium by the decay products, an effect whose observability is entangled with the uncertain Lyman-$\alpha$ fluxes and X-ray heating from the first stars. In this Letter, we explore a novel mechanism, where the Lyman-$\alpha$ photons produced from dark matter decay initiate early Wouthuysen-Field coupling of the spin temperature to the gas temperature, thereby boosting the 21-cm signal. This mechanism provides constraints on dark matter that are less dependent on uncertainties associated with star formation than constraints on exotic heating. We study this effect for decaying dark matter with masses $m_{\chi}\sim20.4-27.2$ eV, where diphoton decay efficiently produces Lyman-series photons. We present forecasts for the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array and the Square Kilometre Array, showing their potential to probe an unconstrained parameter space for light decaying DM, including axion-like particles.

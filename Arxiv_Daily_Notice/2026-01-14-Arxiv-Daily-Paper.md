#### Intermediate-mass black hole incubators. Gas accretion onto stellar black hole clusters in galactic central molecular zones

 - **Abstract**
 The stellar dynamical evolution of massive star clusters formed during starburst periods leads to the segregation of $\gtrsim10^4 M_\odot$ stellar-mass black hole sub-clusters in their centres. In gas-rich environments, such as galactic central molecular zones, these black hole clusters are likely to accrete large amounts of the gas from their surroundings, which in turn affects their internal dynamics. In this Letter we estimated the corresponding accretion rate onto the black hole cluster and its radiative feedback. We assessed whether such an accretion flow can lead to the collapse of the black hole cluster into an intermediate-mass black hole. The estimates were obtained analytically, considering the astrophysical conditions and star formation history reported for the central molecular zone of our Galaxy. We find that a stellar black hole cluster with mass $\gtrsim10^4 M_\odot$ located in the twisted ring of molecular clouds with radius $\approx100$ pc that is observed in the central molecular zone of our Galaxy can accrete about the same mass in gas on a timescale of a few million years. We suggest that this is sufficient for its subsequent collapse into an intermediate-mass black hole. Based on an estimate of the dynamical friction inspiral time, we further argue that the locations of the intermediate-mass black hole candidates recently observed in the central molecular zone are compatible with their formation therein during the last starburst period reported to have occurred $\approx1$ Gyr ago.

 - **Abstract**
 The nucleus of the Milky Way is known to drive a large-scale, multiphase galactic outflow, with gas phases ranging from the hot highly-ionized to the cold molecular component. In this work, we present the first systematic search for molecules in the Milky Way wind. We use the Atacama Pathfinder EXperiment (APEX) to observe the 12CO(2-1) emission line in 19 fields centered on previously known high-velocity atomic hydrogen (HI) clouds associated with the outflow. Over 200 CO clumps are detected within 16 different HI clouds. These clumps have typical radii of 1 - 3 parsec, high velocity dispersions of 1 - 6 km/s and molecular gas masses ranging from a few to several hundred solar masses. Molecular clumps in the wind sit on the low-mass end of the mass - size relation of regular molecular clouds, but are far displaced from the mass (or size) - linewidth relation, being generally more turbulent and showing high internal pressures. Nearly 90% of the clumps are gravitationally unbound with virial parameters >> 10 - 100, indicating that these structures are either being disrupted or they must be confined by external pressure from the surrounding hot medium. While the observed properties of CO clumps do not seem to evolve clearly with latitude, we find that molecular gas is not detected in any of the 6 HI clouds with projected distances over 1 kpc from the Galactic Center, suggesting the existence of a maximum timescale of ~ 3 Myr for the dissociation of molecular gas within the wind. Overall, current observations in the Galactic center support a scenario in which a hot wind entrains cold gas clouds from the disk, driving their progressive transformation from molecular to atomic and ultimately ionized gas through stripping, turbulence, and dissociation.
#### Quantifying Symmetry: Transformation Information for Planetary Nebulae and Supernova Remnants

 - **Abstract**
 We present a quantitative symmetry-identification pipeline for astrophysical images based on Transformation Information (TI), an information measure of self-similarity under geometric transformations. TI is expressed as a Kullback-Leibler (cross-entropy) divergence between an image and its rotated or reflected counterpart on the overlapping domain. By scanning rotation angles and reflection axes, we obtain TI curves whose local minima identify symmetry operations. We validate the method on a wind-rose pattern and then apply it to planetary nebulae, where the recovered axes trace bipolar and multipolar lobes consistent with morphology-based classifications. Applying TI to supernova remnants yields estimate axes associated with protrusions, rims, and substructure. To emphasize global morphology, we introduce a thresholded two-level variant that compares binary silhouettes and can reveal outline-driven symmetries. Finally, we quantify symmetry using a minima prominence-to-width score and show that this compact descriptor separates Type Ia and core-collapse remnants into distinct populations for an X-ray sample. TI provides a non-parametric, reproducible framework for symmetry identification, classification and population studies.
#### Relativistic jets from millisecond proto-magnetars

 - **Abstract**
 Rapidly rotating, strongly magnetized neutron stars (``millisecond proto-magnetars'') formed in stellar core-collapse, neutron star mergers, and white dwarf accretion-induced collapse have long been proposed as central engines of gamma-ray bursts (GRB) and accompanying supernovae/kilonovae. However, during the first few seconds after birth, neutrino heating drives baryon-rich winds from the neutron star surface, potentially limiting the magnetization and achievable Lorentz factors of the outflow and casting doubt on whether proto-magnetars can launch ultra-relativistic jets at early times, as needed to power short-duration GRB. We present 3D general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of neutrino-heated proto-magnetar winds that incorporate M0 neutrino transport. While the global wind properties broadly agree with previous analytic estimates calibrated to one-dimensional models, our simulations reveal essential multidimensional effects. For rapidly rotating models with spin periods P = 1 ms, centrifugal forces strongly enhance mass loss near the rotational equator, producing a dense, sub-relativistic outflow ( ~0.1c). This equatorial wind naturally confines and collimates less baryon-loaded outflows emerging from higher latitudes, leading to the formation of a structured bipolar jet with a peak magnetization up to ~ 30-100 along the pole, sufficient to reach bulk Lorentz factors ~ 100 on larger scales. The resulting angular stratification of the outflow energy into ultra-relativistic polar and sub-relativistic equatorial components is broadly consistent with the observed partition between beaming-corrected GRB energies and supernova/kilonova ejecta. Our results demonstrate that millisecond proto-magnetars can launch relativistic jets within seconds of formation and highlight their potential role in powering the diverse electromagnetic counterparts of compact-object explosions.

 - **Abstract**
 The 1-100 pc region embedding long-duration gamma-ray bursts (lGRBs) has been hitherto unexplored, as extremely high ionisation by the GRB prevents application of optical absorption spectroscopy on such distances. We show that the GRB ionising flux imprints a unique time- and spatially-dependent ionisation structure on the gas, that can be probed by X-ray absorption. Application of this model to a selected sample of 7 bright GRB X-ray afterglow spectra observed by \textit{XMM-Newton} EPIC-pn enables an independent, quantitative estimation of the density (log(n) $\sim$ 2-4) and distances (5-100 pc) of the ionized absorber directly from the GRB X-ray spectrum, thereby allowing us to locate the absorbing medium of this representative sample of long GRBs in the region of the density-size diagram populated by star-forming regions versus other gravitationally bound objects in the Universe.

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar bow shocks are formed when an outflow interacts with the interstellar medium. In white dwarfs accreting from a binary companion, outflows are associated with either strong winds from the donor star, the accretion disk, or a thermonuclear runaway explosion on the white dwarf surface. To date, only six accreting white dwarfs are known to harbour disk-wind driven bow shocks that are not associated to thermonuclear explosions. Here, we report the discovery of a bow shock associated with a high-proper-motion disk-less accreting white dwarf, 1RXS J052832.5+283824. We show that the white dwarf has a strong magnetic field in the range B~42-45 MG, making RXJ0528+2838 the a bonafide known polar-type cataclysmic variable harbouring a bow shock. The resolved bow shock is shown to be inconsistent with a past thermonuclear explosion, or being inflated by a donor wind, ruling out all accepted scenarios for inflating a bow shock around this system. Modelling of the energetics reveals that the observed bow shock requires a persistent power source with a luminosity significantly exceeding the system accretion energy output. This implies the presence of a powerful, previously unrecognized energy loss mechanism - potentially tied to magnetic activity - that may operate over sufficiently long timescales to influence the course of binary evolution.
#### On the Jeans criterion for hydrostatic and infalling gas

 - **Abstract**
 We study the local gravitational instability of non-rotating astrophysical fluids allowing for the presence of an external gravitational potential in addition to the fluid self-gravity. We present a self-consistent linear-perturbation analysis taking into account pressure and density gradients in the background medium. We explore two different steady-state configurations for the unperturbed gas: hydrostatic equilibrium and infall into a gravitational potential well. We show that in both cases the instability criterion is the classical Jeans criterion, which, contrary to previous claims, is not modified by the presence of the external gravitational field. While in the case of hydrostatic equilibrium linear local perturbations are always gravitationally stable, the conditions for gravitational instability can be met in the case of infalling gas, also in the presence of additional non-gravitational forces such as that due to a wind. We conclude that the Jeans criterion can have a role in regulating the formation of clumps and star clusters in streams or shells of gas infalling into galactic gravitational potential wells, as well as, on smaller scales, the fragmentation of gas in collapsing molecular clouds.

 - **Abstract**
 Geologic records of cosmogenic 10Be are sensitive to changes in the radiation environment with time. Recent works suggest there are periods when the Sun encountered massive cold clouds which compressed the heliosphere to within Earth's orbit. This would expose Earth to increased galactic cosmic rays and MeV-energy particles of heliospheric origin. We model 10Be production in Earth's atmosphere during possible cold cloud encounters, and estimate their detectability in marine records of variable temporal resolution. We find that an AU-scale cold cloud encounter can be detected using ocean sediment measurements of 10Be if Earth spends time inside the compressed heliosphere. For typical relative speeds between the Sun and local interstellar clouds, this translates to a crossing time of ~100 years. A cloud must have an extension on the scale of parsecs to tens-of-parsecs (crossing time 0.1-1 Myr) to be detectable through 10Be measurements in iron-manganese crusts.
#### QED V: Variations in metal loading of galactic winds with element nucleosynthetic origin

 - **Abstract**
 Type Ia supernovae, type II supernovae, and asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars are important sites of stellar nucleosynthesis, but they differ greatly in their rates, their location within a galaxy, and the mean thermal energy and abundance distribution of their ejecta. In earlier papers in this series we have shown that a significant fraction of metals newly synthesized by type II supernovae are promptly lost to galactic winds -- i.e., galactic winds are metal loaded. Here we investigate whether the elements returned by type Ia supernovae and AGB stars are similarly metal loaded, or whether metal loading varies significantly with nucleosynthetic site. We use a series of high-resolution ``tall box'' simulations of the interstellar medium with the \quokka~GPU-accelerated code, within which we systematically vary the galaxy gas surface density, metallicity, and the scale heights and relative rates of the different nucleosynthetic sources. We show that the metal loadings of galactic winds differ substantially between metals produced by different sources, with typical variations at the level of $\approx 0.3$ dex, a phenomenon we term differential metal loading. Which set of metals suffers preferential loss from this phenomenon varies depending on the galactic environment, and is not easily predictable \textit{a priori}. Our findings call into question the the interpretation of diagnostics of galaxy formation, for example star formation timescales and initial mass functions, based on abundance diagnostics, since the abundance variations upon which these techniques rely are often at levels comparable to those we show can be induced by differential metal loading.
#### Unraveling Year-Long Radial Velocity Variations in Red Clump Region -- I: Comprehensive analysis of a K0 Giant star, 2 Draconis

 - **Abstract**
 Slow-rotating evolved stars frequently exhibit radial velocity (RV) variations on annual timescales, complicated by instrumental systematics and aliasing in the one-year regime. Here we investigate the origin of the near-yearly periodicity in 2 Dra, a star located in the red-clump region, assessing possible causes between stellar activity, instrumental profile (IP) effects, sampling alias, and planetary companions. We applied two independent approaches: (1) constraining diagnostic signals and performing a correlation analysis ($r$) between period-confined signals, and (2) evaluating phase stability by partitioning Keplerian fits. These methods enabled us to examine the physical connections and phase coherence among stellar activity indicators, RV measurements, and IP diagnostics. Our analysis suggests a stellar rotation period of $\simeq270\text{--}320$\,d for 2~Dra. The 340-d RV signal does not appear to originate from stellar activity in this chromospherically quiet star ($|r| \lesssim 0.33$), nor from instrumental systematics near the annual period ($|r| \lesssim 0.1$). This conclusion is supported by contrasting phase behavior: the RV and stellar activity phases remain stable, whereas the IP phases do not. We therefore propose that the 340-d variation likely arises from either small-amplitude intrinsic variability or a tentative gas giant companion with potential weak activity-induced modulation. The case of 2~Dra provides a framework for distinguishing the origins of $\sim$1-yr RV variations in other evolved stars.

 - **Abstract**
 In this {\it Letter}, we present a compelling and robust argument for the roles of neutrino fast flavor conversion (FFC) in the explosion mechanism of core-collapse supernova (CCSN), combining the {\it multi-angle} FFC subgrid model rooted in quantum kinetic theory with the multi-dimensional four-species Boltzmann neutrino radiation hydrodynamics. Employing various progenitor masses and the nuclear equations of states, we find that the effect of FFC on CCSN explosion is bifurcated depending on the progenitors. For the lowest-mass progenitor, FFC facilitates the shock revival and enhances the explosion energy, whereas for higher-mass progenitors its impact is inhibitory. We identify the mass accretion rate as the key determinant governing this bifurcation. When the mass accretion rate is low (high), the contribution of FFC to neutrino heating becomes positive (negative), because the heating efficiency enhancement via FFC-driven spectral hardening of electron-type neutrinos dominates over (is outweighed by) the concurrent reduction in neutrino luminosity. Our results further highlight the limitations of approximate neutrino transport, and demonstrate that a multi-angle treatment is essential for accurately capturing FFC effects; otherwise, FFCs are missed and even generated spuriously.
#### Anatomy of Empirical Transit Spectra of Mars based on TGO/NOMAD

 - **Abstract**
 Transit spectroscopy is a powerful tool for probing atmospheric structures of exoplanets. Accurately accounting for the effects of aerosols is key to reconstructing atmospheric properties from transit spectra, yet this remains a significant challenge. To advance this effort, it is invaluable to examine the spectral features of well-characterized planetary atmospheres. Here, we synthesize empirical transit spectra of Mars across different seasons based on data from the NOMAD's Solar Occultation channel onboard ExoMars/TGO, which operates at wavelengths of 0.2-0.65 and 2-4 micron. In the generated empirical transit spectra, the atmosphere below 25 km is found to be largely opaque due to the presence of micron-sized dust and water ice clouds, both of which substantially weaken spectral features. The spectra exhibit CO2 absorption features at 2.7-2.8 micron and signatures of sub-micron-sized mesospheric water ice clouds around 3.1 micron, accompanied by a continuum slope. The amplitudes of these spectral features are found to vary with the Martian seasons, where the dust storms weaken the CO2 signatures and strengthen the water ice features, which serve as potential indicators of a dusty planet like Mars. If TRAPPIST-1f possessed a Mars-like atmospheric structure, both CO2 and water ice features would be detectable at a noise level of 3 ppm, a level likely beyond current observational capabilities. Nevertheless, the 3.1 micron feature produced by sub-micron-sized mesospheric water ice clouds offers a novel avenue for characterizing the atmospheres of habitable-zone exoplanets.

 - **Abstract**
 Our Local Group, dominated in mass by the Milky Way (MW) and M31, provides a unique laboratory for testing $\Lambda$CDM cosmology on small scales owing to its proximity. However, its connection to the surrounding large-scale environment, which is essential for interpreting its properties, is inadequately understood. In this work, we explore the connection between Local Group analogues (LGAs) and their surrounding large-scale environments using the ABACUSSUMMIT simulation suite, highlighting the key role of the coupling energy of the MW-M31 orbit, $E_{\rm coupling}$. We find that LGAs with high $E_{\rm coupling}$ preferentially reside in denser regions, whereas those with low $E_{\rm coupling}$ tend to occupy low-density environments. Furthermore, LGAs with low $E_{\rm coupling}$ exhibit strong alignment with cosmic filaments, manifested as a pronounced polar anisotropy in the distribution of tracer haloes. By contrast, LGAs with high $E_{\rm coupling}$ show a weaker polar anisotropy but an enhanced azimuthal anisotropy, with large-scale tracer haloes preferentially lying in the plane spanned by the halo pair and the orbital spin vector. Within this framework, our Local Group is characterised by typical $E_{\rm coupling}$ residing in a relatively under-dense environment, yet it remains consistent with the 95\% range of analogue systems identified in the simulation.
#### On the estimation of Sulfuric Acid Vapor concentrations below the Venus cloud deck using the Akatsuki Radio Science Experiment

 - **Abstract**
 We report new constraints on the vertical distribution of sulfuric acid vapor in the Venusian atmosphere, derived from a refined analysis of radio occultation (RO) data. The method estimates the power spectral density (PSD) of the received signal to recover both the signal intensity and the Doppler shift. The received signal power is estimated at 1-sec cadence which enhances the sensitivity and detection of the signal at lower altitudes of Venus, even in regions of high atmospheric opacity. After correcting total attenuation for refractive losses, absorption by known microwave absorbers is removed, leaving a residual signal attributable to sulfuric acid vapor. Two different methods of estimating the absorption due to Sulfur Dioxide have been presented, including one which incorporates in-situ data, which should better constrain the sulfuric acid vapor abundance below the clouds. Retrieved profiles for altitudes of 40 - 50 km reveal an increasing vapor abundance to more than 10 ppm below the clouds, and a sharp decline above 50 km in line with the expected saturation profile. These measurements agree with current models of the Venusian cloud structure and composition, and demonstrate that RO data, when coupled with optimized spectral analysis, can yield quantitative constraints on trace absorbers in optically thick atmospheres.
#### Revisiting the Great Attractor: The Local Group's streamline trajectory, cosmic velocity and dynamical fate

 - **Abstract**
 We revisit the Great Attractor using the Manticore-Local suite of digital twins of the nearby Universe. The Great Attractor concept has been proposed as an answer to three distinct questions: what sources the Local Group velocity in the cosmic microwave background frame, where present-day velocity streamlines converge, and where the Local Group is moving to. Addressing the original motivation of the Great Attractor -- explaining the Local Group cosmic velocity -- we find that mass within $155~h^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc}$ accounts for only ${\sim}72\%$ of that velocity magnitude with ${\sim}38\,°$ directional offset. We show that even in the purely linear regime convergence within this volume is not guaranteed, particularly when also accounting for small-scale contributions to the observer velocity; no single structure, including the proposed Great Attractor, would be expected to dominate the velocity budget. Streamline convergence is smoothing-scale-dependent, transitioning from Virgo at small scales through the Hydra--Centaurus region at intermediate scales to Shapley at large scales; at intermediate smoothing the convergence point lies near Abell 3565 with an asymmetric basin of mass $\log( M / (h^{-1} \mathrm{M}_\odot)) = 16.4 \pm 0.1$ that excludes Norma. To address the third question, we evolve the Manticore-Local realisations to scale factor $a = 10$ in a new Beyond-Present-Time simulation suite and identify the asymptotic future location of the Local Group. We find that the dominant motion is towards Virgo, but even it contributes at most one third of the Local Group velocity. Our results demonstrate that the classical Great Attractor is not a dynamically dominant structure but an artifact of the instantaneous velocity field, and that no single attractor is likely to account for the Local Group motion in the cosmic rest frame.
#### Substellar population of the young massive cluster RCW 36 in Vela

 - **Abstract**
 The initial mass function (IMF) is a cornerstone of star formation studies, yet its universality remains debated. We investigate the IMF in the young massive cluster RCW 36, located in the Vela Molecular Ridge and comparable to the Orion Nebula Cluster in stellar density. Our goal is to build the most complete census of RCW 36 and derive its first IMF and star-to-brown-dwarf (BD) ratio. We combine new GLAO observations from HAWK-I/VLT with archival data (2MASS, SOFI/NTT) and Gaia DR3 kinematics. Photometric accuracy and source extraction were improved using \textsc{DeNeb}, a deep-learning algorithm that removes complex nebular emission. Membership probabilities were assigned via color-magnitude diagram comparisons with a control field, and stellar masses were estimated using model isochrones. We find a revised distance of $954\pm40\,$pc and determine the IMF down to $\sim0.03\,M_{\odot}$, described by a broken power law ($dN/dM\propto M^{-\alpha}$) with $\alpha=1.62\pm0.03$ for $0.20$-$20\,M_{\odot}$ and $\alpha=0.46\pm0.14$ for $0.03$-$0.20\,M_{\odot}$. The star-BD ratio is $2$-$5$, consistent with other Galactic clusters. Lastly, through a study of the differences in the IMF within and outside $0.2\,$pc and the cumulative mass distributions for low-mass and intermediate to high-mass sources, we also detected signs of possible mass segregation within RCW 36, which should be primordial. RCW 36 shares many characteristics with other young massive clusters, such as a shallower than Salpeter high-mass slope and the possibility of mass segregation. The flatter lower-mass regime of the IMF is similar to most Galactic clusters. The star-BD ratio is also in line with the observed values in other clusters, independent of their inherent properties.
#### The drastic impact of Eddington-limit induced mass ejections on massive star populations

 - **Abstract**
 Massive stars are the key engines of the Universe. However, their evolution and thus their ionizing feedback are still not fully understood. One of the largest gaps in current stellar evolution calculations is the lack of a model for the mass ejections that occur when the stars reach the Eddington limit, such as during an Luminous Blue Variable (LBV) phase. We aim to remedy this situation by providing a physically motivated and empirically calibrated method applicable in any 1D stellar evolution code to approximate the effect of such mass loss on stellar evolution. We employ the 1D stellar evolution code MESA, in which we implement a new mass-loss prescription that is acting when stellar models inflate too much when reaching the Eddington limit. Synthetic massive-star stellar populations using calculated grids of single-star models with this mass loss prescription are compared with the observed populations in the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds. In combination with already computed grids of binary evolution models, we investigate the impact of binarity on our predictions. Our single-star models reproduce key features of the observed stellar populations, namely (i) the absence of stars located beyond the Humphreys-Davidson limit, (ii) an upper limit of RSG luminosities, (iii) the faintest observed single WR stars, (iv) the absolute number of O-stars, WRs, and RSGs, (v) WO stars in low metallicity environments, and (vi) the positions of LBV stars in the HRD. Our binary population explains at the same time the 70% binary fraction of O-stars and the 40% binary fraction of WR stars. However, our synthetic population also has caveats, such as an overproduction of bright H-free WN stars. Our results show that the effect of Eddington-limit induced mass ejections on the structure and evolution of massive stars can remove tension between predicted and observed massive star populations.

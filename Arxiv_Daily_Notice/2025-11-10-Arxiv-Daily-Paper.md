 - **Abstract**
 We present SGNL, a scalable, low-latency gravitational-wave search pipeline. It reimplements the core matched-filtering principles of the GstLAL pipeline within a modernized framework. The Streaming Graph Navigator library, a lightweight Python streaming framework, replaces GstLAL's GStreamer infrastructure, simplifying pipeline construction and enabling flexible, modular graph design. The filtering core is reimplemented in PyTorch, allowing SGNL to leverage GPU acceleration for improved computational scalability. We describe the pipeline architecture and introduce a novel implementation of the Low-Latency Online Inspiral Detection algorithm in which components are pre-synchronized to reduce latency. Results from a 40-day Mock Data Challenge show that SGNL's event recovery and sensitivity are consistent with GstLAL's within statistical and systematic uncertainties. Notably, SGNL achieves a median latency of 5.4 seconds, a 42\% reduction compared to GstLAL's 9.3 seconds.
#### The essential elements of dust evolution: a-C(:H) nanoparticle sub-structures and photo-fragmentation

 - **Abstract**
 Hydrogenated amorphous carbon materials, a-C(:H), are heterogeneous structures consisting of carbon atoms in different hybridisation states and bonding configurations and are thought to constitute a significant and observationally important fraction of the interstellar dust material. This work aims to characterise semi-conducting a-C(:H) nanoparticle structures and, in particular, their property-characterising aromatic domain size distribution and so predict how they will behave in intense UV radiation fields that can fragment them through dissociative and charge effects as a result of carbon-carbon bond-breaking. Using a statistical approach we determine the typical sizes of the aromatic domains, their size distribution, how they are network-bonded, and where they are to be found within the structure. We consider the effects of thermal excitation, photo-dissociation and charging of a-C(:H) nanoparticles, and the products of their fragmentation. The derived UV photon-induced fragmentation lifetimes for nanometre-sized a-C(:H) nanoparticles, with radii ~0.4-0.5nm radius and containing ~40-60 carbon atoms, are of the order of 10^6-10^7yr in the diffuse interstellar medium and likely 10^2-10^4 times shorter in photodissociation regions, depending on the local radiation field intensity. Grains larger than this are stable against photodissociation. In H{\footnotesize II} regions only a-C(:H) nanoparticles with radii greater than 0.7nm (> 150 carbon atoms) are likely to survive. The photon-driven fragmentation of sub-nanometre a-C(:H) particles was determined to be important in the diffuse interstellar medium and also in high excitation regions, such as photodissociation and HII regions. However, in these same regions Coulomb fragmentation is unlikely to be an important dust destruction process.

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.04764

 - **Abstract**
 Quiescent solar prominences show distinct small-scale dynamics in observations. Their internal density contrasts with the surrounding corona make them susceptible to Rayleigh-Taylor (RT) instabilities, leading to vertically structured prominence morphologies when observed at the solar limb. As a result, prominences develop bubbles and plumes, along with secondary Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) roll-ups along their edges. Recent observations also suggest magnetic reconnection events within the RT-driven turbulent flows. We perform high-resolution 2.5D resistive magnetohydrodynamic simulations using the open-source MPI-AMRVAC code, reaching a spatial resolution of $\sim 11.7$ km in a 2D domain of size 30 Mm$\times$30 Mm and evolving the system for approximately 10 minutes of solar time. A dense, magnetic pressure supported prominence serves as the initial state, which becomes unstable at the prominence-corona interface. The resulting interaction between RT and KH instabilities leads to the formation of current sheets and localized reconnection events. The reconnection-driven outflows form energetic jets that enhance energy transport and dissipation across the prominence. We analyze our high-resolution prominence simulation using synthetic images of the broadband SDO/AIA 094, 171, and 193 Å and narrowband H$\alpha$ filters, to compare the developing fine-scale structures with their observational counterparts. Most secondary instabilities emerge in the hotter coronal regions surrounding the cooler prominence core. While our simulated features match observed scales, speeds, and duration, the simulated activity remains concentrated in hot, surrounding coronal plasma rather then the cool prominence material, implying that key physical ingredients may be missing. Future 3D studies in more realistic magnetic configurations are required to address these limitations.
#### Kinematic and extinction analysis of a potential spiral arm beyond the Galactic bar

 - **Abstract**
 Determining the structure of the Milky Way is essential for understanding its morphology, dynamics, and evolution. However, studying its innermost regions is challenging due to high extinction and crowding. The detection of a double red clump (RC; core-helium-burning stars) feature at very low Galactic latitudes suggests the presence of a spiral arm beyond the Galactic bar, providing new insights into the Galaxy's structure along this complex line of sight. We evaluate this possibility by analysing the proper motion and extinction distributions of the detected RC features. We constructed proper motion and extinction difference maps to investigate the kinematic and reddening properties of the RC populations, and the kinematic differences were validated using N-body simulations of a Milky Way-like galaxy. We find that the two RC features are kinematically distinct, with a relative proper motion difference of $-0.16\pm0.02\, mas/yr$ in the component parallel to the Galactic plane. This difference can be explained by Galactic rotation if the two RCs lie at different distances, consistent with the simulations. The extinction towards the secondary RC is also $\sim0.05$ mag higher than that of the primary RC. Additionally, we estimate that the extinction difference between the RC features corresponds to only $\sim5\%$ of the total extinction from Earth to the first RC, suggesting little interstellar material between the farthest edge of the Galactic bar and the kinematically distinct structure traced by the secondary RC. Using $JK_s$ photometry, we derive $A_J/A_{K_s}=3.34\pm0.07$, consistent with previous results and showing no significant variation across fields or along the line of sight. The results support the secondary clump tracing a distant structure, possibly a spiral arm, although we cannot exclude that the population belongs to the disc.
#### Blind Strong Gravitational Lensing Inversion: Joint Inference of Source and Lens Mass with Score-Based Models

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.04792

 - **Abstract**
 Score-based models can serve as expressive, data-driven priors for scientific inverse problems. In strong gravitational lensing, they enable posterior inference of a background galaxy from its distorted, multiply-imaged observation. Previous work, however, assumes that the lens mass distribution (and thus the forward operator) is known. We relax this assumption by jointly inferring the source and a parametric lens-mass profile, using a sampler based on GibbsDDRM but operating in continuous time. The resulting reconstructions yield residuals consistent with the observational noise, and the marginal posteriors of the lens parameters recover true values without systematic bias. To our knowledge, this is the first successful demonstration of joint source-and-lens inference with a score-based prior.
#### On the Energetic Role of Forward Neutrino Scattering in Core-Collapse Supernovae

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.04896

 - **Abstract**
 We revisit neutrino-matter coupling in the post-shock region of core-collapse supernovae by restoring nuclear recoil in coherent neutrino-nucleus scattering (CEvNS). The resulting local energy transfer (a few keV per ~10 MeV neutrino) accumulates across the ~100 km stalled-shock layer, yielding a total heating of 10^49-10^50 erg, comparable within an order of magnitude to the increment required to trigger shock revival in current multidimensional simulations. This indicates that the long-standing failure of isoenergetic transport schemes to revive the shock originates from their neglect of recoil kinematics. Because the momentum exchange in each scattering is tiny, the emergent neutrino spectra and lepton-number balance remain essentially unchanged. The result highlights nuclear recoil as a minimal yet physically grounded correction to standard neutrino transport, providing a self-consistent route toward reliable explosion modeling.
#### Investigation on the Predictive Potentiality of Photospheric Magnetic Parameters for Distinguishing Confined from Eruptive Solar Flares

 - **Abstract**
 A question often arises as to why some solar flares are confined in the lower corona while others, termed eruptive flares, are associated with coronal mass ejections (CMEs). Here we intend to rank the importance of pre-flare magnetic parameters of active regions in their potentiality to predict whether an imminent flare will be eruptive or confined. We compiled a dataset comprising 277 solar flares of GOES-class M1.0 and above, taking place within 45 deg from the disk center between 2010 and 2023, involving 94 active regions. Among the 277 flares, 135 are confined and 142 are eruptive. Our statistical analysis reveals that the magnetic parameters that are most relevant to the flare category are: total unsigned magnetic flux $\Phi$, mean magnetic shear angle $\Theta$ along the polarity inversion line (PIL), photospheric free magnetic energy $E_f$, and centroid distance $d$ between opposite polarities. These four parameters are not independent of each other, but in combination, might be promising in distinguishing confined from eruptive flares. For a subset of 77 flares with high-gradient PILs, the area of high free energy regions ($A_{\mathrm{Hi}}$) becomes the most effective parameter related to the flare type, with confined flares possessing larger $A_{\mathrm{Hi}}$ than eruptive ones. Our results corroborate the general concept that the eruptive behavior of solar flares is regulated by an interplay between the constraining overlying flux, which is often dominant in both $\Phi$ and $E_f$ and related to $d$, and the current-carrying core flux, which is related to $\Theta$.

 - **Abstract**
 The $\gamma$-ray from Giant molecular clouds (GMCs) is regarded as the most ideal tool to perform in-situ measurement of cosmic ray (CR) density and spectra in our Galaxy. We report the first detection of $\gamma$-ray emissions in the very-high-energy (VHE) domain from the five nearby GMCs with a stacking analysis based on a 4.5-year $\gamma$-ray observation with the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO) experiment. The spectral energy distributions derived from the GMCs are consistent with the expected $\gamma$-ray flux produced via CR interacting with the ISM in the energy interval 1 - 100 $~\rm$ TeV. In addition, we investigate the presence of the CR spectral `knee' by introducing a spectral break in the $\gamma$-ray data. While no significant evidence for the CR knee is found, the current KM2A measurements from GMCs strongly favor a proton CR knee located above 0.9$~\rm$ PeV, which is consistent with the latest measurement of the CR spectrum by ground-based experiments.

 - **Abstract**
 We present an emulator suite for the one- and two-loop cold dark matter power spectrum from the Effective Field Theory of Large Scale Structures (EFTofLSS). Specifically, we emulate separately the various contributions to the one- and two-loop parts of the power spectrum, leaving out the possible counterterms which can be added as multiplicative prefactors. By leaving the time-dependence of the counterterms unspecified at the emulation stage, our technique has the advantage of being extremely versatile in fitting any type of counterterm parametrisation to data, or to simulations, without having to change the emulator. We construct our emulators using the method of symbolic regression which results in functions that can be used directly in computer code, while achieving errors of better than $0.5\%$ within the $k$-range of validity of EFT and maintaining ultra-fast computational evaluation of less than $\sim5\times10^{-4}s$ on a single core.
#### Upper limits on atmospheric abundances of KELT-11b and WASP-69b from a retrieval approach

 - **Abstract**
 WASP-69b and KELT-11b are two low-density hot Jupiters, which are expected to show strong atmospheric features in their transmission spectra. Such features offer valuable insights into the chemical composition, thermal structure, and cloud properties of exoplanet atmospheres. High-resolution spectroscopic observations can be used to study the line-forming regions in exoplanet atmospheres and potentially detect signals despite the presence of clouds. We aimed to detect various molecular species and constrain the chemical abundances and cloud deck pressures using high-resolution spectroscopy. We observed multiple transits of these planets with CARMENES and applied the cross-correlation method to detect atmospheric signatures. Further, we used an injection-recovery approach and retrievals to place constraints on the atmospheric properties. We detected a tentative H$_2$O signal for KELT-11b but not for WASP-69b, and searches for other molecules such as H$_2$S and CH$_4$ resulted in non-detections for both planets. By investigating the signal strength of injected synthetic models, we constrained which atmospheric abundances and cloud deck pressures are consistent with our cross-correlation results. In addition, we show that a retrieval-based approach leads to similar constraints of these parameters.

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.05174

 - **Abstract**
 The center-to-limb variations (CLVs) of photospheric and chromospheric spectral lines were obtained in 2025 July and August using drift scans from the echelle spectrograph of the 0.7 m Vacuum Tower Telescope at the Observatorio del Teide (ODT) in Tenerife, Spain. This instrument can observe four spectral regions simultaneously, enabling multi-line spectroscopy with high spectral resolution of various activity features and the quiet Sun in the lower solar atmosphere. The initial results of Halpha observations demonstrate the diagnostic potential of drift scans obtained with a ground-based, high-resolution telescope. Data products include spectroheliograms and maps of physical parameters such as line-of-sight velocity, line width, and line-core intensity. The combination of the CLV from photospheric and chromospheric lines, as well as the wide range of formation heights of the selected lines, renders this dataset ideal for characterizing stellar and exoplanet atmospheres.
#### Co-existence of Internal Gravity Waves and Tayler-Spruit Magnetic Fields in the Radiative Core of Low-mass Stars

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.05181

 - **Abstract**
 The Tayler-Spruit dynamo (TSD) is able to generate a small-scale magnetic field in the differentially rotating stably stratified layers of stars and was recently observed in numerical simulations. In parallel, the propagation of internal gravity waves in stars can be modified in the presence of a magnetic field. Here we first want to estimate the interaction between a magnetic field generated by the TSD and internal gravity waves in the radiative core of low-mass stars. This allows us to then characterise the effect of this interplay on the observed standing modes spectrum and on the internal transport of angular momentum by progressive waves. To do this, we use the STAREVOL evolution code to compute the structure of low-mass rotating stars along their evolution. In particular, we implement a formalism to describe the TSD and estimate the regions where the generated magnetic field is strong enough to change the identity of internal gravity waves to magneto-gravity waves. In addition, we evaluate the possible limitation of angular momentum transport by the combined action of rotation and magnetism. We show that along the pre-main sequence and main-sequence evolution, the lowest frequencies of the excited gravity wave spectrum could be converted to magneto-gravity waves by the magnetic field generated by the TSD. During the red-giant branch we find that most of the excited spectrum of progressive internal gravity waves could be converted into magneto-gravity waves in the very central region.

 - **Abstract**
 The papers included in this Focus Point collection are devoted to the studies on the cosmological tensions and challenges stimulated by the latest observational data. The first results of the LARES-2 laser ranging satellite on the high precision testing of the frame-dragging effect predicted by General Relativity are presented. The data on the S-stars monitoring in the Galactic center obtained by GRAVITY collaboration were analysed within the Physics-informed neural network (PINN) approach. The results enabled to probe the role of the cosmological constant, of the dark matter, the star cluster in the core of the Galaxy obtaining an upper limit for the star density. The topics include the conversion of high-frequency relic gravitational waves into photons in cosmological magnetic field, cosmological gravitational waves stochastic background generation through the spontaneous breaking of a global baryon number symmetry, observational predictions of the Starobinsky inflation model and other studies.
#### Near-degeneracy effects in Quadrupolar Mixed Modes. From an Asymptotic Description to Data Fitting

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.05314

 - **Abstract**
 Dipolar (l=1) mixed modes revealed surprisingly weak differential rotation between the core and the envelope of evolved solar-like stars. Quadrupolar (l=2) mixed modes also contain information on the internal dynamics, but are very rarely characterised due to their low amplitude and the challenging identification of adjacent or overlapping rotationally split multiplets affected by near-degeneracy effects. We aim to extend broadly used asymptotic seismic diagnostics beyond l=1 mixed modes by developing an analogue asymptotic description of l=2 mixed modes, explicitly accounting for near-degeneracy effects that distort their rotational multiplets. We derive a new asymptotic formulation of near-degenerate mixed l=2 modes that describes off-diagonal terms representing the interaction between modes of adjacent radial orders. We implement the formalism within a global Bayesian mode-fitting framework, for a direct fit of all l=0,1,2 modes in the power spectrum density. We are able to asymptotically model the asymmetric rotational splitting present in various radial orders of l=2 modes observed in young red giant stars without the need for any numerical stellar modelling. Applied to the Kepler target KIC 7341231, our formalism yields core and envelope rotation rates consistent with previous numerical modelling, while providing improved constraints from the global and model-independent approach. We also characterise the new target KIC 8179973, measuring its rotation rate and mixed-mode parameters for the first time. The global fit allows for much better precision than standard methods, yielding better constraints for rotation inversions. We place the first observational constraints on the asymptotic l=2 mixed mode parameters (DPi_2,q_2,eps_g2), paving the way towards the use of asymptotic seismology beyond l=1 mixed modes.
#### A subpopulation of low-mass, spinning black holes: signatures of dynamical assembly

 - **Abstract**
 Gravitational-wave observations of massive, rapidly spinning binary black holes mergers provide increasing evidence for the dynamical origin of some mergers. Previous studies have interpreted the mergers with primary mass $\gtrsim45\,M_\odot$ as being dominated by hierarchical, second-generation mergers, with rapidly spinning primaries being the products of previous black hole mergers assembled in dense stellar clusters. In this work, we reveal confident evidence of another subpopulation with rapid and isotropic spins at low mass containing the two exceptional events GW241011 and GW241110, consistent with a hierarchical merger hypothesis. Our result suggests the mass distribution of the second-generation black holes is peaked at low primary masses of $\sim16\,M_\odot$ rather than $\gtrsim45\,M_\odot$ in the pair-instability gap. Such low-mass second-generation black holes must be formed from the merger of even lighter first-generation black holes, implying that dense, metal-rich stellar environments contribute to the binary black hole population. By separating the contamination of higher-generation black holes, our result reveals the primary mass distribution of first-generation black holes formed from stellar collapse, which shows a significant dip between $\sim12\,M_\odot$ to $\sim20\,M_\odot$. This may indicate a dearth of black holes due to variation in the core compactness of the progenitor.

#### Revisiting the Radius Valley Across Stellar Types: A Transit-Only Analysis of M, K, G, and F Stars with Updated NASA Exoplanet Archive Data

 - **Abstract**
 The radius valley -- a deficit of exoplanets between super-Earths and sub-Neptunes -- is a key diagnostic of planet formation and atmospheric evolution. We investigate how the radius valley depends on stellar type by analyzing an updated, transit-only sample of exoplanets from the NASA Exoplanet Archive. Planets are selected with $P < 100$ days and divided by host spectral class (M, K, G, F). We construct weighted radius distributions and apply statistical tests to quantify the valley depth. We recover a pronounced valley centered near $\sim 1.8\,R_\oplus$ for G/K stars, but shifted to $\sim 1.6\,R_\oplus$ for M dwarfs and $\sim 1.9\,R_\oplus$ for F stars. These results support the view that the radius valley is shaped by stellar-dependent processes such as photoevaporation, core-powered mass loss, and orbital migration.

 - **Abstract**
 The orbits of stars around Sgr A*, the Milky Way's supermassive black hole, provide a unique laboratory for testing its environment with unprecedented precision. In this work, we compute the apsidal precession induced by extended matter distributions through Lagrange's equations and compare it with the measured precession of S2, reproducing and extending GRAVITY's constraints. In particular, we push bounds on boson clouds to larger gravitational couplings $\alpha$ and to the second-fastest superradiant mode. We also show that environments with mass of order $1\%$ of Sgr A* drive stellar orbits to decay by dynamical friction within a few Myr. The inner star cluster is however efficiently replenished, masking this effect observationally. We also show that orbital resonances from boson clouds have no impact on relevant timescales. While S2 currently provides the cleanest dataset, our framework is readily applicable to other stars that we identify as particularly promising, whose orbits will be measured with increasing accuracy, opening up new opportunities to probe the environment of Sgr A*.

 - **Abstract**
 Over the last two decades, the Sun has been observed to be depleted in refractory elements as a function of elemental condensation temperature (\tcond) relative to $\sim 80\%$ of its counterparts. We assess the impact of Galactic chemical evolution (GCE) on refractory element--\tcond\ trends for 109,500 unique solar analogs from the GALAH, APOGEE, Gaia RVS, and \cite{bedell18} surveys. We find that a star's \feh\ and \alphafe\ are indicators of its \tcond\ slope (\rsq\ = $15 \pm 5$, $23 \pm 10\%$ respectively) while \teff\ and \logg\ contribute more weakly (\rsq\ = $9 \pm 5$, $13 \pm 16\%$). The Sun's abundance pattern resembles that of more metal-rich (0.1 dex) and $\alpha$-depleted stars ($-0.02$ dex), suggesting a connection to broader GCE trends. To more accurately model stars' nucleosynthetic signatures, we apply the K-process model from \cite{Griffith24}, which casts each star's abundance pattern as a linear combination of core-collapse and Type Ia supernovae contributions. We find the Sun appears chemically ordinary in this framework, lying within $0.5\sigma$ of the expected solar analog abundance distribution. We show that refractory element--\tcond\ trends arise because elements with higher \tcond\ have higher contributions from core-collapse supernovae. Refractory element depletion trends primarily reflect nucleosynthetic enrichment patterns shaped by GCE and local ISM inhomogeneities, with these processes accounting for $93\%$ of the observed variation within 2$\sigma$. This work highlights how abundance diversity due to local and global chemical enrichment may often mask and mimic population-scale signatures of planet-related processes.
#### Breaking Down the $\textsf{CosmoGEMS}$: Toward Modeling and Understanding Globular Cluster Stellar Streams in a Fully Cosmological Context

 - **Abstract**
 Next-generation surveys are expected to uncover thousands of globular cluster (GC) stellar streams, motivating the need for a theoretical framework that produces realistic GC streams in a fully cosmological, Milky Way-like environment. We present $\textsf{CosmoGEMS}$, a star-by-star cosmological GC stream framework that self-consistently links small-scale cluster physics with large-scale Galactic dynamics. The initial phase-space positions of stream stars are informed by post-processed GC populations within the FIRE cosmological simulation. Escaped stars are orbit-integrated from their time of escape to the present day in a time-evolving Galactic potential extracted from the same simulation using a basis function expansion. We explore two example streams on different orbits. One forms a long, thin stream with a velocity dispersion consistent with Milky Way GC streams. However, it exhibits a clump and orbital-phase-dependent misalignments due to the evolving potential. The other stream develops both a thin component and a diffuse, shell-like structure, similar to features observed in streams like Jhelum. These results highlight the power of fully cosmological models in producing realistic stream morphologies and kinematics. Unlike idealized simulations, our models naturally incorporate time-dependent changes in the progenitor's orbit, including orbital plane evolution, which significantly affects stream structure. This challenges common assumptions in stream-finding algorithms and interpretation. $\textsf{CosmoGEMS}$ provides a key step toward connecting future stellar stream observations with the physics of globular cluster evolution and hierarchical galaxy formation in a cosmological context.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. kAndb is a substellar companion near the planet-brown dwarf boundary, orbiting a B9IV star at 50-100 au. Estimates of its age and mass vary, fueling a decade-long debate. Atmospheric parameters (Teff 1650-2050 K, log(g) 3.5-5.5) remain poorly constrained due to model differences and heterogeneous datasets. Aims. We refine the characterization of kAndb using mid-infrared data to capture its bolometric emission. Combined with NIR measurements, we constrain Teff, log(g), and radius to reduce uncertainties in age and mass. Methods. We obtained JWST/MIRI coronagraphic data (F1065C, F1140C, F1550C) and recalibrated NIR photometry with an updated ATLAS stellar model. MIRI color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) probe the likelihood of species (CH4, NH3, silicates). We compared H and F1140C colors and magnitudes to isochrones to constrain age and mass. We modeled the spectral energy distribution with atmosphere models to refine Teff, radius, and log(g), and to constrain age and mass using evolutionary models. Results. Cloudy atmosphere models fit best, consistent with the L0/L2 spectral type and position near silicate-atmosphere field objects in the MIRI CMD. We derived an age of 47+-7 Myr and mass of 17.3+-1.8 MJup by weighted-mean model combination. Modeling yielded Teff = 1791+-68 K and radius = 1.42+-0.06 RJup, improving precision by 30%. Log(g) = 4.35+-0.07 dex represents a 70% improvement over the previous best value (4.75+-0.25). Conclusions. The new mass places kAndb just above the deuterium-burning limit. The age is 75% more precise and consistent with the Columba association (42 Myr). The Teff suggests silicate clouds, requiring spectroscopic confirmation. MIRI data were crucial to refining radius and temperature, which led to stronger constraints on age and mass and improving the overall characterization of kAndb.

 - **Abstract**
 We present optical photometry and spectroscopy of SN 2019hnl. Discovered within ~26 hr of explosion by the ATLAS survey, SN 2019hnl is a typical Type IIP supernova with a peak absolute V band magnitude of -16.7+-0.1 mag, a plateau length of ~107 days, and an early decline rate of 0.0086+-0.0006 mag (50 days)^-1. We use nebular spectroscopy and hydrodynamic modeling with the SNEC, MESA, and STELLA codes to infer that the progenitor of SN 2019hnl was a M_ZAMS ~ 11M_solar red supergiant which produced 0.047+-0.007M_solar of 56Ni in the explosion. As a part of our hydrodynamic modeling, we reduced hydrogen envelope mass by scaling the mass loss within the "Dutch" wind scheme to fit our light curve, showing that the progenitor of a relatively typical Type IIP SN may experience partial stripping during their evolution and establish massive (~0.2M_solar) CSM environments prior to core collapse.

 - **Abstract**
 The Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) experiences disruption from tidal and ram-pressure forces as it travels through the halo of the Milky Way. In this project, we combine radio emission-line observations from the GASS and GASKAP surveys with UV absorption-line observations from the HST Ultraviolet Legacy Library of Young Stars as Essential Standards (ULLYSES) program to trace the material in front of the LMC. Along our 8 stellar sightlines near 30 Doradus, we observe gaseous structures likely associated with two arm-like features flowing in and around the LMC's disk. We detect the nearside gas in neutral, low, and medium ionization species. The lower-ionization species likely undergo both thermal and non-thermal broadening while the moderately-ionized phase is influenced by more non-thermal processes. The total integrated column density of AlIII decreases with increasing angular offset from 30 Doradus, with sightlines within 0.25 degrees containing more moderately ionized gas. We demonstrate from a Gaussian decomposition technique on the HI emission that both arms likely trace an additional 1.0 degree in Galactic longitude toward the 30 Doradus region than previously predicted. We constrain the orientation of the arms by suggesting that they likely converge around (l,b) =(280.5$^\circ$, -31.2$^\circ$) and at least partially cross in front of the LMC. Our observations are consistent with two competing origins of the arms: 1) outflowing material is swept back by tidal and ram-pressure forces or 2) tidally stripped inflows fuel the ongoing stellar activity inside the LMC. Future studies are needed to distinguish between these scenarios.
#### Discovery of the pre-main-sequence eclipsing binary MML 48

 - **Abstract**
 We present the discovery of the eclipsing binary MML 48, which is a member of Upper Centaurus Lupus, has an associated age of 16 Myr, and is composed of two young, low-mass stars. We used space- and ground-based observations to characterize the system with both time-series photometry and spectroscopy. Given the extreme mass ratio between the stars, q_EB = 0.209 +- 0.014, we modeled a single-lined spectroscopic and eclipsing binary system. The orbital period, 2.0171068 +- 0.0000004 d, is measured from the highest precision light curves. We derive a primary mass of 1.2 +- 0.07 Msun using stellar models, and with radial velocities we measured a secondary mass of 0.2509 +- 0.0078 Msun. The radii are large, as expected for pre-main-sequence stars, and are measured as 1.574 +- 0.026 +- 0.050 Rsun and 0.587 +- 0.0095 +- 0.050 Rsun, for the primary and secondary stars, respectively. MML 48 joins the short list of known low-mass, pre-main-sequence eclipsing binaries (EBs), being one of only five systems with intermediate ages (15-25 Myr), and the system with the most extreme mass ratio. The primary star is currently at the "fusion bump", undergoing an over-production of energy in the core due to the build-up of 3He before reaching its equilibrium abundance set by the proton-proton (p-p) I chain. MML 48 A is the first young star in an eclipsing system that has been found during its fusion bump. MML 48 is thus an important benchmark for low-mass stellar evolution at a time when the stars are rapidly changing, which allows for a tight constraint on the corresponding isochrone given the uneven mass ratio.

 - **Abstract**
 We perform a detailed analysis of radial oscillations to discuss dynamical stability in two-fluid neutron stars composed of ordinary nuclear matter and a gravitationally coupled dark matter component. Using a fully relativistic two-fluid formalism, we solve the eigenvalue problem for a coupled system of equations with small-amplitude radial perturbations and derive the critical line corresponding to stability boundaries. We also compare these stability boundary lines obtained from the radial perturbations with those obtained from a generalized turning-point criterion based on extremization of mass and particle numbers, and find that the two methods agree to within better than $1\%$ across the parameter space explored. We consider both mirror dark matter and self-interacting fermionic dark matter models, and examine how microphysical properties$-$such as nuclear equations of state, dark matter mass, and vector coupling strength$-$reshape the topology of the stability boundary and gravitational mass contours. Our results reveal the emergence of ultra-dense and compact stars, with nuclear central densities exceeding single-fluid instability thresholds by factors of two or more, and the appearance of twin-star configurations with identical masses but distinct radii and internal fluid compositions. These findings have direct implications for the interpretation of neutron star observables and motivate future studies involving phase transitions, density discontinuities, or additional interactions in multi-component stellar systems. In particular, the emergence of exotic stable configurations beyond conventional stability limits underscores the need to reassess standard criteria in light of multi-fluid dynamics, with significant consequences for multimessenger probes of dense matter$-$including gravitational wave signals, mass-radius constraints, and post-merger remnants.

 - **Abstract**
 Post-Asymptotic Giant Branch (post-AGB) binary stars are evolved systems that host circumbinary discs formed through mass loss during late-stage binary interaction. Their structural, kinematic, and chemical similarities to planet-forming discs have motivated the idea that these systems may act as sites of "second-generation" planet formation. In this study, we assess whether the gravitational instability mechanism - a proposed pathway for giant planet formation in some protoplanetary discs-can operate in post-AGB discs. Using the Toomre criterion under well-motivated assumptions for disc structure and size, mass, and thermal properties, we assess the conditions for gravitational instability. We first benchmark our analytical framework using several well-studied protoplanetary disc systems before applying the same analysis to observed post-AGB discs. We find that post-AGB discs are generally gravitationally stable at present, due primarily to their low masses. The disks were stable against collapse, even when accounting for potentially higher disk mass in the past. In contrast, several protoplanetary discs analysed in the same way show that they likely experienced gravitationally unstable phases early on. Finally, we revisit the planet formation scenario proposed for the post-common envelope system NN Serpentis first carried out by Schleicher and Dreizler and we show that gravitational instability could be feasible under specific, high disc mass assumptions, however we note that their proposed disc mass is unlikely. Overall, our results provide the first systematic theoretical assessment of gravitational instability in post-AGB discs, demonstrating that this mechanism is unlikely to dominate second-generation planet formation in these systems, and underscoring the need to explore alternative pathways-such as core accretion-in future studies
#### A Full-Atmosphere Model of Jupiter

 - **Abstract**
 This paper presents a combined 1D photochemical-thermochemical kinetics model of Jupiter's deeper atmosphere, troposphere and stratosphere. The model covers atmospheric pressure range from $1.1 \times 10^{3}$ bar to $7.4 \times 10^{-11}$ bar and is the first model that incorporates sulfur chemistry when spanning an atmospheric region of this extent. This model incorporates a new version of the STAND reaction network with updated NH4SH chemistry, and updated Antoine equation parameters for NH4SH and H2S. Validation against current models of Jupiter's atmosphere as well as recent observational data shows that our model successfully describes Jupiter's main observed chemical features. Since one of the focuses of the model is the chemistry on nitrogen, it correctly predicts the formation of a mixed NH3-NH4SH cloud layer between 0.1 and 1 bar. It also describes the chemistry of HCN throughout the atmosphere and discovers a region in the stratosphere between $1 \times 10^{-6}$ and $6.76 \times 10^{-8}$ bar, where HCN forms through radical chemistry with maximum mixing ratio 33 ppb at $2.94 \times 10^{-7}$ bar -- a prediction testable by observations. At the same time, our model predicts a quenched N2 mixing ratio 490 ppm up to 10$^{-6}$ bar. The model therefore successfully bridges the gap between existing models of separate regions of Jupiter's atmosphere and makes new testable predictions of several chemical species.
#### SISSI: Supernovae in a stratified, shearing interstellar medium. II. Star formation near the Sun is quenched by expansion of the Local Bubble

 - **Abstract**
 The age of the Local Bubble (LB) can be used to constrain the timescales, on which the interstellar medium in the solar neighborhood is evolving. Previous estimates have put the age of the LB at $\gtrsim 14\,\text{Myr}$, and suggested that its expansion was powered by $\sim 15-20$ SNe, yet in a companion paper we have seen hints that this age might be too high. Following up on these hints, we aim to place new constraints on the age of the LB. We reconstruct the geometry and momentum of the LB using publicly available 3D dust maps to compare its geometry to that of the high-quality sample of simulated supernova remnants in the SISSI project. We find that, in contrast to previous estimates, $\gtrsim 20$ SNe over $\sim 4\,\text{Myr}$ are required to explain both the momentum and the size of the LB. The julia source-code for our analysis is made available at this https URL. Previous estimates of the age of the LB have seemingly overestimated its age and underestimated the number of SNe powering its expansion. Our results are in tension with the assumption that the LB is powered solely by SNe associated with the nearby Scorpius-Centraurus OB association, which appears to have stopped forming stars at about the same time as the LB began to expand. In light of this new evidence, our results cast serious doubts on the claim that star formation in the solar neighborhood was driven by the expansion of the LB, and might have instead quenched it.
#### A fast machine learning tool to predict the composition of astronomical ices from infrared absorption spectra

 - **Abstract**
 Current observations taken by James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) allow us to observe the absorption features of icy mantles that cover interstellar dust grains, which are mainly composed of $\mathrm{H_2O}$, $\mathrm{CO}$, and $\mathrm{CO_2}$, along with other minor species. Thanks to its sensitivity and spectral resolution, JWST has the potential to observe ice features towards hundreds of sources at different stages along the process of star formation. However, identifying the spectral features of the different species and quantifying the ice composition is not trivial and requires complex spectroscopic analysis. We present Automatic Ice Composition Estimator (AICE), a new tool based on artificial neural networks. Based on the infrared (IR) ice absorption spectrum between 2.5 and 10 microns, AICE predicts the ice fractional composition in terms of $\mathrm{H_2O}$, $\mathrm{CO}$, $\mathrm{CO_2}$, $\mathrm{CH_3OH}$, $\mathrm{NH_3}$, and $\mathrm{CH_4}$. To train the model, we used hundreds of laboratory experiments of ice mixtures from different databases, which were reprocessed with baseline subtraction and normalisation. Once trained, AICE takes less than one second on a conventional computer to predict the ice composition associated with the observed IR absorption spectrum, with typical errors of $\sim$3 $\%$ in the species fraction. We tested its performance on two spectra reported towards the NIR38 and J110621 background stars observed within the JWST Ice Age program, demonstrating a good agreement with previous estimations of the ice composition. The fast and accurate performance of AICE enables the systematic analysis of hundreds of different ice spectra with a modest time investment. In addition, this model can be enhanced and re-trained with more laboratory data, improving the precision of the predictions and expanding the list of predicted species.

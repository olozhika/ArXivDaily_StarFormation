 - **Abstract**
 Central to our understanding of stellar evolution and its impact on processes in our Galaxy and across the Universe is the study of mass loss. While the general framework is well established, recent JWST observations of objects like NGC 3132 have revealed intricate nebular structures, suggesting complex mass-loss processes likely driven by multiple star system at its core. These findings pose new challenges for the currently available investigation tools. The primary goal of this study is the first detailed comparison of the physical properties and chemical composition obtained for NGC 3132, based on the latest detailed 3D model and observations from MUSE, JWST and Spitzer. We evaluate the reliability of the traditional empirical method and photoionization model for abundances estimations, both based on the same available high-quality, spatially resolved observations. We find that the model and empirical method yield consistent results for the integrated total properties such as Te, ne and chemical abundances. However, when applied to simulated observations from the model, the empirical method fails to recover the model input abundances, providing only an approximate estimate. This discrepancy arises in part from the loss of information when summing fluxes over regions which have complex ionisation structures. This discrepancy in the case of oxygen has been estimated to be up to 35%. Moreover, the latest IR data reveal a spatial correlation between H2, c(Hb) as well as the [8.0]/[4.5] IRAC ratio. Finally, new clumps are discovered in [Ni II] 7378 Å, [Fe II] 8617 Åand [Fe III] 5270 Åemission lines.

 - **Abstract**
 Gamma-ray emission from the plane of the Milky Way is understood as partly originating from the interaction of cosmic rays with the interstellar medium. The same interaction is expected to produce a corresponding flux of neutrinos. In 2023, IceCube reported the first observation of this galactic neutrino flux at 4.5$\sigma$ confidence level. The analysis relied on neutrino flux predictions - based on gamma ray observations - to model the expected neutrino emission from the galactic plane. Three signal hypotheses describing different possible spatial and energy distributions were tested, where the single free parameter in each test was the normalization of the neutrino flux. We present first results of an analysis that can improve the characterization of Galactic neutrino emission by dividing the galactic plane into segments in galactic longitude. An unbinned maximum-likelihood analysis is used that can fit the spectral index and the flux normalization separately in each segment. While gamma ray telescopes can not differentiate between hadronic and leptonic emission, neutrino production must come from hadronic processes. Measuring a spectral index can further help to understand the contribution of unresolved neutrino sources inside the galactic plane. This work uses a full-sky cascade dataset and provides model-independent insight into the variation of the neutrino flux and energy distribution from different regions of the galactic plane.

 - **Abstract**
 Orphan penumbrae (OPU) are features resembling sunspot penumbrae, but are not connected to an umbra. Here we compare OPUs and sunspot penumbrae, including their filaments. We also identify and describe the main mechanisms for the formation of OPUs and we characterise their decay process. Our study is based on spectropolarimetric inversions of active regions observed with the Hinode spectropolarimeter. We manually identified 80 individual OPUs, allowing us to study them statistically. In addition, we analysed the time-evolution of selected OPUs using data provided by the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager. Orphan penumbrae display a broad range of shapes, associated with typically $\Omega$-shaped magnetic field configurations, where opposite polarity fields predominate at the two ends of the OPU. In addition, the properties of the OPU filaments are remarkably uniform between different OPUs, resembling the ones in sunspot penumbrae. Most OPUs form by either a patch of a penumbra separating from a sunspot, or by new magnetic flux emerging close to the polarity inversion line of an active region. We observe chromospheric fibrils above almost all OPUs in Hinode H$\alpha$ images, indicating that a part of the magnetic field of the OPUs extends to the chromosphere. Our results show that OPU filaments can form given a broad range of boundary conditions for the magnetic field.

 - **Abstract**
 The gas-phase metallicity affects heating and cooling processes in the star-forming galactic interstellar medium (ISM) as well as ionising luminosities, wind strengths, and lifetimes of massive stars. To investigate its impact, we conduct magnetohydrodynamic simulations of the ISM using the FLASH code as part of the SILCC project. The simulations assume a gas surface density of 10 M$_\odot$ pc$^{-2}$ and span metallicities from 1/50 Z$_\odot$ to 1 Z$_\odot$. We include non-equilibrium thermo-chemistry, a space- and time-variable far-UV background and cosmic ray ionisation rate, metal-dependent stellar tracks, the formation of HII regions, stellar winds, type II supernovae, and cosmic ray injection and transport. With the metallicity decreasing over the investigated range, the star formation rate decreases by more than a factor of ten, the mass fraction of cold gas decreases from 60% to 2.3%, while the volume filling fraction of the warm gas increases from 20% to 80%. Furthermore, the fraction of H$_\mathrm{2}$ in the densest regions drops by a factor of four, and the dense ISM fragments into approximately five times fewer structures at the lowest metallicity. Outflow mass loading factors remain largely unchanged, with values close to unity, except for a significant decline at the lowest metallicity. Including the major processes that regulate ISM properties, this study highlights the strong impact of gas phase metallicity on the star-forming ISM.
#### JVLA Measurement of Grain Size in the Compact Dust Ring around Class I Protostar WL 17

 - **Abstract**
 The maximum grain size in protoplanetary disks is a critical parameter for planet formation, as the efficiency of mechanisms like streaming instability and pebble accretion depend on grain size. Even young class 0/I objects, such as HL Tau, show substructures in their disks, indicating the potential for early planet formation. In this study, we investigated the grain size in the dust surrounding the class I object WL 17 using the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array. Observations were conducted across seven frequency bands (Q, Ka, K, Ku, X, C, and S bands) ranging from 2 to 48 GHz, corresponding to wavelengths of 15 cm to 6.3 mm, with a spatial resolution exceeding 0\farcs5. While the ring structure at 0\farcs1 of WL 17 remains unresolved in our data, its emission is clearly detected at all observed frequencies, except at 2 GHz. To estimate the maximum grain size ($a_{\rm max}$) within the ring, we compared the observed spectral energy distribution (SED) with theoretical SEDs calculated for various $a_{\rm max}$ values using radiative transfer models. Assuming the dust opacity follows the DSHARP model, our analysis suggests that certain structures internal to the ring achieved a maximum grain size of approximately 4.2 mm. Additionally, we discuss the gravitational stability of the ring and the potential planetary core mass that could form through pebble accretion within the structure.

 - **Abstract**
 The supernova remnant (SNR) RCW86 is among the few SNRs with Balmer-emission lines containing broad and narrow spectral components that trace fast, non-radiative shocks in partially-ionized gas.\ These are invaluable laboratories for collisionless shock physics, especially for poorly-understood phenomena like electron-ion equilibration, and shock precursors. Here we present the first $\sim$0.3 pc spatial scale integral field unit (IFU) observations of the southwestern RCW86 shock, obtained as part of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey-V Local Volume Mapper (SDSS-V LVM). The forward shock, clearly visible as thin filaments in narrowband images, have broad H$\alpha$ components, indicating shock velocities varying from 500--900 km/s in the south to 1000--1500 km/s in the north. The varying velocity widths and broad-to-narrow intensity ratios show that electrons and ions have lower equilibration ($T_e/T_p \rightarrow 0.1$) in faster ($>$800 km/s) shocks, in line with previous studies. The broad components are generally redshifted from the narrow components by $\lesssim$100 km/s, likely due to shock-obliquity or non-Maxwellian post-shock distributions. We observe high extinction-corrected Balmer-decrements of 3--5 in the narrow components, indicating that conversion of Ly$\beta$ photons to H$\alpha$ is more efficient than Ly$\gamma$ to H$\beta$. Broad HeII$\lambda$4686 was marginally ($\gtrsim$2$\sigma$) detected in the southern shock, meaning the shock is impacting gas with high ($>$30--100\%) neutral fraction. We also find the first evidence of an intermediate H$\alpha$ component in RCW86, with $\Delta$V(FWHM) = 193--207 km/s, likely due to a neutral precursor. We also briefly discuss the southwestern radiative shock, and lay out the exciting future of studying astrophysical shocks with LVM.
#### The Rosetta Stone Project. I. A suite of radiative magnetohydrodynamics simulations of high-mass star-forming clumps

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Star formation and, in particular, high-mass star formation are key astrophysical processes that are far from being fully understood. Unfortunately, progress in these fields is slow because observations are hard to interpret as they cannot be directly compared to numerical simulations. Synthetic observations are therefore necessary to better constrain the models. Aims. With the Rosetta Stone project, we aim to develop an end-to-end pipeline to compare star formation simulations with observations as accurately as possible in order to study the evolution from clumps scales to stars. Methods. Using the adaptive mesh-refinement code RAMSES, we computed a first grid of model of star-forming clumps to develop our pipeline and explore the impact of the clump initial conditions on their evolution. The main purpose of this set of simulations is to be converted into synthetic observations to enable a direct comparison with real star-forming clumps observed with Herschel and ALMA. Results. The Rosetta Stone simulations presented here provide a catalog available for full post-processing and subsequent comparison with observations (RS1). Among all the parameters explored here, the strength of the magnetic field has the strongest influence on the clump evolution (fragmentation, star formation, global collapse) at both large and small scales. Numerical parameters such as the resolution per Jeans length or the threshold for accretion onto sink particles affects the formation of low-mass sinks. Finally, the widely used L/M ratio is found to be a good indicator of the clump evolutionary state regardless of its initial condition, but this could change when more feedback processes (jets, HII regions) are included. Conclusions. We now have a new suite of simulations of star-forming clumps that is available for full post-processing and subsequent comparison with the observations,

 - **Abstract**
 The accurate determination of the absolute energy scale in cosmic ray measurements is both a challenging and fundamentally important task. We present how measurements of radio pulses from extensive air showers with the Auger Engineering Radio Array, combined with per-event simulations of radio emission using the CoREAS extension of CORSIKA, allow us to determine the energy scale of cosmic rays between $3\cdot 10^{17}$\,eV and several $10^{18}$\,eV. Our analysis accounts for many factors, each of which is controlled on the 5\% level or better. The absolute calibration of the antennas and the entire analog signal chain builds on a Galactic calibration in combination with a detailed understanding of the antenna-gain patterns. Additional key elements include compensation for temperature-dependent signal amplification, continuous detector health monitoring, an active veto for thunderstorm conditions, an unbiased event reconstruction, and per-event atmospheric modeling in the simulations. The analysis benefits from a high-statistics dataset of over 800 measured cosmic ray showers. We describe our analysis method, perform multiple cross-checks, and evaluate systematic uncertainties. We find that absolute energies determined with AERA are 12\% higher than those established with the Auger Fluorescence Detector, a result well in agreement within systematic uncertainties and thus a strong independent confirmation of the absolute energy scale of the Pierre Auger Observatory.

 - **Abstract**
 Identifying the progenitors of thermonuclear supernovae (Type Ia supernovae; SNe Ia) remains a key objective in contemporary astronomy. The rare subclass of SNe Ia that interacts with circumstellar material (Type Ia-CSM) allows for studies of the progenitor's environment before explosion, and generally favours single-degenerate progenitor channels. The case of SN Ia-CSM PTF11kx clearly connected thermonuclear explosions with hydrogen-rich CSM-interacting events, and the more recent SN 2020eyj connected SNe Ia with helum-rich companion progenitors. Here we present a study of SN 2020aeuh, a Type Ia-CSM with delayed interaction. We analyse photometric and spectroscopic data that monitor the evolution of SN 2020aeuh and compare its properties with those of peculiar SNe Ia and core-collapse SNe. At early times, the evolution of SN 2020aeuh resembles a slightly overluminous SN Ia. Later, the interaction-dominated spectra develop the same pseudocontinuum seen in Type Ia-CSM PTF11kx and SN 2020eyj. However, the later-time spectra of SN 2020aeuh lack hydrogen and helium narrow lines. Instead, a few narrow lines could be attributed to carbon and oxygen. We fit the pseudobolometric light curve with a CSM-interaction mode, yielding a CSM mass of 1-2 M$_{\odot}$. We propose that SN 2020aeuh was a Type Ia supernova that eventually interacted with a dense medium which was deficient in both hydrogen and helium. Whereas previous SNe Ia-CSM constitute our best evidence for nondegenerate companion progenitors, the CSM around SN 2020aeuh is more difficult to understand. We include a hydrodynamical simulation for a double-degenerate system to showcase how the dynamical evolution of such a progenitor scenario could produce the CSM observed around SN 2020aeuh. It is clear that SN 2020aeuh challenges current models for stellar evolution leading up to a SN Ia explosion.

 - **Abstract**
 The IceCube Neutrino Observatory is currently the largest and most sensitive detector for astrophysical neutrinos and has pioneered the field of high-energy neutrino astronomy. Despite being designed with the primary goal of identifying astrophysical TeV neutrinos and their corresponding sources, recent studies, utilising the DeepCore subdetector, have shown IceCube's proficiency in being sensitive to astrophysical neutrinos at GeV energies. Currently, there is a gap in sensitivity between the supernova detection system at MeV energies and the lowest-energy triggering events around 1 GeV. In this contribution, we present the ongoing efforts to cover this gap and increase the sensitivity of IceCube to sub-GeV astrophysical neutrinos. Despite high background rates, we show how the complimentary use of manifold and supervised machine learning can make IceCube sensitive to neutrinos from transient sources down to energies of 100 MeV.
#### A new type-1 transition in NGC 1346 revealed by (spectro)polarimetry

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first photo- and spectropolarimetric observations of the changing-look active galactic nucleus NGC~1346 taken with the Perkins telescope (November 2022, March 2025) and VLT/FORS2 (August and September 2024), which have revealed a new spectral transition. We find that NGC~1346 has reverted to its former (2001) type-1 spectral state after having been a type-2 active galactic nucleus from 2004 to 2022. More and more intense broad H$\beta$ (3720 $\pm$ 310 km.s$^{-1}$ full width at half maximum) and H$\alpha$ (2985 $\pm$ 230 km.s$^{-1}$) emission lines appeared between August and September 2024, suggesting that the broad-line region (BLR) is increasingly irradiated. The strong blueshift of the Balmer lines ($\sim$ 1600 km.s$^{-1}$) indicates that the gas is moving toward the observer, possibly due to a radiation-driven outflow. The strong difference between 2022's ($\sim$ 3\%) and 2024-2025's de-biased polarization ($\le$ 0.5\%), the blueing of the spectra between August and September 2024, and the slow rise in the integrated flux between 2022 and 2025 argue against asymmetric or temporary obscuration by a cloud passing in front of the line of sight. Two options, either a re-illumination of the BLR or a tidal disruption event, can explain the observed properties of NGC~1346. Timely follow-up observations taken while the phenomenon is still ongoing are needed to determine which of the two solutions is the correct one.

 The IceCube Observatory at the South Pole has been operating in its full configuration since May 2011 with a duty cycle of about 99%. Its main component consists of a cubic-kilometer array of optical sensors deployed deep in the Glacial ice designed for the detection of high-energy astrophysical neutrinos. A surface array for cosmic ray air shower detection, IceTop, and a denser inner subdetector, DeepCore, significantly enhance the capabilities of the observatory, making it a multipurpose facility. This list of contributions to the 39th International Cosmic Ray Conference in Geneva, Switzerland (July 15-24, 2025) summarizes the latest results from IceCube covering a broad set of key questions in physics and astrophysics. The papers in this index are grouped topically to highlight IceCube contributions related to high-energy neutrino and multi-messenger astrophysics, atmospheric fluxes, cosmic-ray physics, low-energy neutrino transients, physics beyond the Standard Model, detector calibration and event reconstruction, and the status and performance of the IceCube Upgrade, a dense sensor infill complemented by calibration devices to be deployed by the end of 2025. Contributions related to IceCube-Gen2, the planned future extension of IceCube, are available in a separate collection.

 - **Abstract**
 The IceTop array at the surface of the IceCube Neutrino Observatory measures extensive air showers produced by cosmic-ray particles with energies from PeV up to EeV, covering the transition region from galactic to extragalactic sources. This contribution presents significant improvements that will enhance the measurement of the cosmic-ray energy spectrum. (I) To analyze more than a decade of data with increasing snow overburdens on the detector, an improved method to handle the time-dependent attenuation of the detector signals was developed. (II) New analysis cuts have been developed to increase the measured event rate while improving the reconstruction quality. (III)~A~new reconstruction method that separately fits the electromagnetic and muonic components, while incorporating data from the deep in-ice detector, enables the reconstruction of air showers with cores outside the IceTop array, up to zenith angles of 50°. These improvements will significantly increase the event statistics and extend the IceTop spectrum towards higher energies.
#### Unambiguous GeV gamma-rays from molecular clouds illuminated by particles diffusing from the adjacent supernova remnant G335.2+0.1 that is confined in an expanding bubble

 - **Abstract**
 We report the detection of GeV gamma-ray emission likely associated with supernova remnant (SNR) G335.2+0.1 and the finding of a molecular cloud ($\sim20$--$30^\prime$ in angular size) that is very likely in physical contact with the SNR and responsible for the gamma-ray emission. Using the 16.8 yr Fermi-LAT data, an extended emission, with a significance of 13.5 $\sigma$ and a radius 0.24° in 0.2--500 GeV in the uniform-disk model, was found to the adjacent east of the SNR. With archival Mopra CO-line data, a large molecular clump at local-standard-of-rest velocity $\sim-48$ to $-43$ km s$^{-1}$ was revealed appearing coincident with the gamma-ray source. The SNR was found located in a cavity encircled by a 'C'-shaped ring-like molecular shell at $-45$ to $-43$ km s$^{-1}$. This morphological agreement, together with the position-velociy diagrams made along lines cutting across the cavity, suggests that the SNR was evolving in the expanding molecular bubble created by the stellar wind of the progenitor with a mass $\gtrsim 15 M_{\mathrm{sun}}$. The giant molecular cloud, visible at around $-46$ km s$^{-1}$, and the associated SNR are thus estimated to lie at a kinematic distance of 3.1 kpc, with the HI absorption taken into account. We suggest that the SNR has entered the radiative phase after the blastwave recently struck the cavity wall. With the evolutionary scenario of the SNR, we demonstrate that the gamma-ray emission reported here can be naturally interpreted by the hadronic interaction between the accelerated protons that escaped from the SNR shock and the eastern large molecular clump.
#### Statistical Analysis of Early Spectra in Type II and IIb Supernovae

 - **Abstract**
 We present a comprehensive analysis of the early spectra of type II and type IIb supernovae (SNe) to explore their diversity and distinguishable characteristics. Using 866 publicly available spectra from 393 SNe, 407 from type IIb SNe (SNe IIb) and 459 from type II SNe (SNe II), we analysed H$\alpha$ and He~I 5876 A at early phases ($<40$ days from the explosion) to identify possible differences between these two SN types. By comparing the pseudo-equivalent width (pEW) and full width at half maximum (FWHM), we find that the strength of the absorption component of these lines serves as a quantitative discriminator, with SNe IIb exhibiting stronger lines at all times. The most significant differences emerge within the first 10-20 days. To assess the statistical significance of these differences, we apply statistical methods and machine-learning techniques. Population density evolution reveals a clear distinction in both pEW and FWHM. Quadratic Discriminant Analysis confirms distinct evolutionary patterns, particularly in pEW, while FWHM variations are less pronounced. A combination of t-distributed Stochastic Neighbour Embedding and Linear Discriminant Analysis effectively separates the two SN types. Additionally, a Random Forest Classifier demonstrates the robustness of pEW and FWHM as classification criteria, allowing for accurate classification of newly observed SNe II and IIb based on computed classification probabilities. Applying our method to low-resolution spectra obtained from the Zwicky Transient Facility Bright Transient, a magnitude-limited survey, we identified 34 misclassified SNe. This revision increases the estimated fraction of SNe IIb from 4.0% to 7.26%. This finding suggests that misclassification significantly impacts the estimated core-collapse SN rate. Our approach enhances classification accuracy and provides a valuable tool for future supernova studies.

 - **Abstract**
 Neutrino observations are crucial for multi-messenger astronomy, but currently limited by effective area and atmospheric background. However, while other telescopes must point their limited field of view, IceCube can perform full-sky realtime follow-up of astrophysical transient sources with high uptime. For this, IceCube uses its Fast Response Analysis (FRA), which can provide results from an unbinned maximum likelihood analysis within tens of minutes of an astrophysical transient. Besides manually selected transient candidates, it also routinely scans areas of the sky compatible with gravitational wave alerts from LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA and the IceCube event singlets most likely to originate from an astrophysical source. Currently the analysis uses TeV muon neutrino candidate events whose signature permits especially precise angular reconstruction, selected and reconstructed at the South Pole and transmitted with low-latency over satellite. Recently, different event selections are also being included in IceCube analyses. These efforts include the follow-up of gravitational wave events with GeV neutrinos detected by IceCube-DeepCore and the observation of the Galactic plane with cascade events produced by all neutrino flavors. If made available on a day-scale latency, these event selections can also be used in FRAs. Moreso, multiple event samples can be combined in a Fast Response Analysis that is sensitive to a broader energy range of a neutrino transient spectrum and ensures the inclusion of all neutrino flavors. We present the analysis method and technical aspects of such an extension of the existing framework. This includes a proposed new pipeline allowing the inclusion of the more computationally-intensive reconstruction methods used by the aforementioned event selections. The extension is validated using example analyses implemented in this framework. (abbreviated)

 - **Abstract**
 The rapid neutron-capture process (r-process) is responsible for the creation of roughly half of the elements heavier than iron, including precious metals like silver, gold, and platinum, as well as radioactive elements such as thorium and uranium. Despite its importance, the nature of the astrophysical sites where the r-process occurs, and the detailed mechanisms of its formation, remain elusive. The key to resolving these mysteries lies in the study of chemical signatures preserved in ancient, metal-poor stars. In this review, we explore r-process nucleosynthesis, focusing on the sites, progenitors, and formation mechanisms. We discuss the role of potential astrophysical sites such as neutron star mergers, core-collapse supernovae, magneto-rotational supernovae, and collapsars, that can play a key role in producing the heavy elements. We also highlight the importance of studying these signatures through high-resolution spectroscopic surveys, stellar archaeology, and multi-messenger astronomy. Recent advancements, such as the gravitational wave event GW170817 and detection of the r-process in the ejecta of its associated kilonovae, have established neutron star mergers as one of the confirmed sites. However, questions remain regarding whether they are the only sites that could have contributed in early epochs or if additional sources are needed to explain the signatures of r-process found in the oldest stars. Additionally, there are strong indications pointing towards additional sources of r-process-rich nuclei in the context of Galactic evolutionary timescales. This review summarizes what has been learned so far, the challenges that remain, and the exciting prospects for future discoveries. The increasing synergy between observational facilities, computational models, and large-scale surveys is poised to transform our understanding of r-process nucleosynthesis in the coming years.

 - **Abstract**
 Non-relativistic effective field theories (NREFTs) play a crucial role in various areas of physics, from cold atom experiments to cosmology. In this paper, we present a systematic framework for deriving NREFTs from relativistic theories with generic self-interactions. Our approach allows for (but is not limited to) non-power-law potentials (such as those arising from dilatons or axions) or potentials that are non-analytic around the classical vacuum (such as those with logarithmic radiative corrections). These are of theoretical and phenomenological interest but have largely been unexplored in the non-relativistic regime. NREFTs are typically viewed as approximations for systems with low velocities, weak couplings, and small field amplitudes. The latter assumption is relaxed in our approach, as long as the mass term remains dominant (ensuring the validity of the non-relativistic limit). Additionally, we establish an effective fluid description for the non-relativistic scalar field, identifying key quantities such as energy density, pressure, and sound speed. To enable cosmological applications, we extend our formalism to account for the expanding universe, providing a reliable tool for investigating ultra-light dark matter models with arbitrary self-interactions. Finally, we demonstrate the applicability of our NREFT in analyzing solitons, which is also relevant to cosmology for studying celestial objects such as boson stars and the cores of dark matter halos.

 - **Abstract**
 Astrophysical high-energy (TeV-PeV) neutrinos were first discovered in 2013, but their origin remains largely unknown. Here we present SN 2023uqf, a supernova found in coincidence with high-energy neutrino IC231004A, as part of a systematic optical follow-up program with the Zwicky Transient Facility. SN 2023uqf had a luminous and rapidly-evolving lightcurve, and spectroscopic observations indicated that the source was a Type Ibn supernova. Spectroscopic signatures confirm ongoing interaction between the supernova ejecta and a dense circumstellar medium, as expected for high-energy neutrino production in a core-collapse supernova. Given the rare nature of Type Ibn supernovae, SN 2023uqf is unlikely to have been discovered by chance over the course of our program (p=0.3%). Our discovery of SN 2023uqf provides the first observational evidence to support long-held theories that interacting supernovae can serve as cosmic hadron accelerators.

 - **Abstract**
 We study the efficiency of high-e migration as a pathway for Hot Jupiter formation in the dense globular cluster 47 Tuc. Gravitational N-body simulations are performed to investigate the orbital evolution of star-planet systems due to dynamical stellar perturbations. Planetary systems that have been scattered into orbits of sufficiently high eccentricity can undergo tidal circularisation, with Hot Jupiter formation being one possible stopping condition. We also account for the possibility of (i) ionisation due to high-energy encounters, (ii) tidal disruption of the planet by tidal forces inside the Roche limit and (iii) Warm Jupiter formation. The orbital evolution of a population of cold Jupiter progenitors, with initial semi-major axes between 1-30 au, is simulated over 12 Gyr using a simplified dynamical model of 47 Tuc. Our computational treatment of dynamical encounters yields an overall HJ occurrence rate of F_HJ = 5.9 x 10^-4 per cluster star (a 51 per cent enhancement relative to the analytic baseline). The probability of Hot Jupiter formation is highest in the core and falls off steeply beyond a few parsecs from the centre of the cluster, where the stellar density is too low to drive efficient eccentricity diffusion.

 - **Abstract**
 The nearby TRAPPIST-1 system, with its seven small rocky planets orbiting a late-type M8 star, offers an unprecedented opportunity to search for secondary atmospheres on temperate terrestrial worlds. In particular, the 0.8 Earth-radii planet TRAPPIST-1 d lies at the edge of the habitable zone (equilibrium temperature ~262 K). Here we present the first 0.6-5.2 micron NIRSpec/PRISM transmission spectrum of TRAPPIST-1 d from two transits with JWST. We find that stellar contamination from unocculted bright heterogeneities introduces 500-1,000 ppm visit-dependent slopes, consistent with constraints from the out-of-transit stellar spectrum. Once corrected, the transmission spectrum is flat within $\pm$100-150 ppm, showing no evidence for a haze-like slope or molecular absorption despite NIRSpec/PRISM's sensitivity to CH4, H2O, CO, SO2, and CO2. Our observations exclude clear, hydrogen-dominated atmospheres with high confidence (greater than 3$\sigma$). We leverage our constraints on even trace amounts of CH4, H2O, and CO2 to further reject high mean molecular weight compositions analogous to Titan, a cloud-free Venus, early Mars, and both Archean Earth and a cloud-free modern Earth scenario (greater than 95% confidence). If TRAPPIST-1 d retains an atmosphere, it is likely extremely thin or contains high-altitude aerosols, with water cloud formation at the terminator predicted by 3D global climate models. Alternatively, if TRAPPIST-1 d is airless, our evolutionary models indicate that TRAPPIST-1 b, c, and d must have formed with less than approximately 4 Earth oceans of water, though this would not preclude atmospheres on the cooler habitable-zone planets TRAPPIST-1 e, f, and g.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a kinematic study of young stars in Messier 16 (M16) using the Gaia Data Release 3 and high-resolution spectra. A total of 345 stars are selected as genuine members using the published lists of X-ray, infrared sources, and early-type stars as well as the Gaia data. There is severe differential reddening across this region and the reddening law of the intracluster medium appears abnormal. The distance to M16, derived from the parallaxes of the members, is about 1.7 kpc. The ages of members, estimated by comparing their color-magnitude diagram with theoretical isochrones, range from 1 Myr to 4 Myr. This star-forming region is composed of an open cluster (NGC 6611) and a distributed population. This cluster shows a clear pattern of expansion and rotation. Some of the distributed population are spatially associated with the gas pillars located at the ridge of H II bubble. In particular, several stars moving away from the cluster are physically associated with the northeastern pillar. In addition, their younger ages support the idea that the formation of these stars was triggered by the feedback from massive stars in NGC 6611. On the other hand, the other stars do not show systematic radial or stream motions; therefore, they likely formed through spontaneous star formation events. We discuss the formation of young stars in the context of cluster expansion, spontaneous star formation, and feedback-driven star formation, and suggest that all of these mechanisms possibly contributed to their formation.
#### Solar magnetic flux rope eruptions caused by inverse flux feeding processes

 - **Abstract**
 Large-scale solar eruptions are generally accepted to have coronal magnetic flux ropes as their core structures. Recent studies found that the solar eruptions could be initiated by a sequence of flux feeding processes, during with chromospheric fibrils rise and merge with the pre-existing coronal flux rope. Further theoretical analyses have demonstrated that the normal flux feeding, i.e. the axial magnetic flux within the fibril is in the same direction as that in the flux rope, results in the accumulation of the total axial flux within the flux rope, so as to initiate the eruption. If the directions of the axial flux in the fibril and the flux rope are opposite, it is termed inverse flux feeding, whose influence on coronal flux ropes, however, is still unclear. In this paper, we use a 2.5-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic model to simulate the evolution of coronal flux ropes associated with inverse flux feeding. It is found that inverse flux feeding is also efficient in causing solar eruptions: although the total signed axial magnetic flux of the rope decreases after inverse flux feeding, the total unsigned axial flux can accumulate; the eruption occurs if the unsigned axial flux of the rope reaches a critical value, which is almost the same as the threshold for normal flux feeding. The total axial currents within the rope are also similar during the onset of the eruptions caused by both normal and inverse flux feeding. Our simulation results suggest that it is the unsigned axial magnetic flux rather than the signed axial flux that regulates the onset of coronal flux rope eruptions.
#### Theoretical Mass Function for Secondaries Forming via Gravitational Instability in Circumstellar Disks

 - **Abstract**
 This paper constructs a theoretical framework for calculating the distribution of masses for secondary bodies forming via gravitational instability in the outer regions of circumstellar disks. We show that several alternate ways to specify the mass scale of forming objects converge to the same result under the constraint that the parental disks are marginally stable with stability parameter $Q=1$. Next we show that the well-known constraint that the formation of secondary bodies requires rapid cooling is equivalent to that of opacity limited fragmentation. These results are then used to derive a mass function for secondary objects forming through disk instablity. The resulting distribution is relatively narrow, with log-normal-like shape, a characteristic mass scale of order $M_{\scriptstyle \rm P}\sim10M_{\scriptstyle \rm Jup}$ and an approximate range of $4-80M_{\scriptstyle \rm Jup}$. Current estimates for the occurrence rate suggest that these objects are outnumbered by both stars and planets formed via core accretion.
#### The Effects of Sunspots on Spectral Line Shapes in the Visible

 - **Abstract**
 We present a comparative spectral analysis to explore the ability of a cooler Sun model to accurately capture the spectral line shape changes caused by Sunspots. In the search for small Earth-like planets, the effects of stellar surface activity can overwhelm the $\sim$10 cm/s planetary RV signal. This necessitates the development of new stellar modeling methods and a greater understanding of the impact of surface activity on stellar spectra. Some attempts to model out noise from Sunspot activity, in particular, have used a sum of a stellar model with a model of a cooler, but otherwise identical star. From our analysis, we find that a cooler effective temperature alone cannot capture the numerous spectral line shape variations seen in a Sunspot observation. The cooler temperature of a Sunspot not only deepens the cores of atomic lines, it also increases and strengthens molecular lines that are not fully represented in our line list. Furthermore, our LTE models and a comparison cool star also fail at capturing line strengthening, broadening, blending, and splitting induced by the magnetic field in the Sunspot.

 - **Abstract**
 The IceCube Neutrino Observatory at the South Pole detects neutrinos of astrophysical origin via their interactions with ice. The main array is optimized for the detection of neutrinos with energies above 1 TeV. A much smaller infill array, known as IceCube DeepCore, extends the sensitivity down to a few GeV. Neutrinos observed in both parts of the detector are used for astrophysical-source searches with multiple messengers. We present two analyses that follow up archival gravitational wave (GW) events from runs O1 through O3 of LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA. The first analysis uses two neutrino datasets: one with high-energy tracks and another consisting of low-energy tracks and cascades. These two neutrino datasets were previously used independently to follow-up GW events. In the analysis presented here, a combined likelihood search is performed using both datasets to search for neutrinos coincident with the GW events across a wide energy range, from a few GeV to several PeV. The second analysis, for the first time, uses a neutrino-induced cascade sample with events of energy above ~1 TeV for searches of coincident neutrino-GW emission. We present results from both analyses and discuss prospects for conducting these analyses in real time.

 - **Abstract**
 Line intensity mapping (LIM) is an emerging technique for probing the large scale structure (LSS) in the post-reionisation era. This captures the integrated flux of a particular spectral line emission from multiple sources within a patch of the sky without resolving them. Mapping different galaxy line emissions, such as the HI $21$-cm and CO rotational lines via LIM, can reveal complementary information about the bias with which the line emitters trace the underlying matter distribution and how different astrophysical phenomena affect the clustering pattern of these signals. The stage where the structures in the cosmic web merge to form a single connected structure is known as the percolation transition. Using mock HI $21$-cm and CO($1-0$) LIM signals in the post-reionisation universe, we explore the connectivity of structures through percolation analysis and compare it with that of the underlying galaxy distribution. We probe the relative contributions of voids, filaments, and sheets to the galaxy density and line intensity maps using a morphological measure known as the local dimension. The CO($1-0$) map exhibits an increased filamentary behaviour and larger contribution from sheets than the $21$-cm map. We attempt to explain such an emission of the CO($1-0$) line from biased environments. The upcoming SKA-Mid will produce tomographic intensity maps of the $21$-cm signal at $z \lesssim 3$ in Band-1. CO maps can be produced at these redshifts in phase 2 of SKA-Mid, where the frequency coverage is expected to increase up to $\sim 50$ GHz. We present forecasts for the recovery of the local dimensions of these intensity maps contaminated by instrumental noise, considering SKA-Mid observations.
#### Dynamical properties of high-[Mg/Fe] stars in the Milky Way bar region

 - **Abstract**
 The origin of the high-alpha component of the Galactic bulge remains debated, unlike the bar-driven origin of the low-alpha bulge. We examine the metallicity-dependent dynamical properties of high-[Mg/Fe] stars in the bar region, using samples of low- and high-[Mg/Fe] stars from APOGEE DR17, complemented by the PIGS catalogue of [Fe/H] $ < -1 $ stars. The mean Galactocentric rotational velocity $ \overline V_\phi(R) $ is nearly cylindrical for both low- and high-[Mg/Fe] stars across the bulge and outer bar. $\overline V_\phi(R)$ of high-[Mg/Fe] stars with [Fe/H] $ \ge -0.6 $ is similar within errors to low-[Mg/Fe] stars in the bulge, and $ 10-20\% $ lower in the outer bar. The mean radial velocity field of these stars exhibits a quadrupole pattern similar to low-[Mg/Fe] stars. Orbit integrations in realistic barred Galactic potentials show that these model-independent properties correspond to a peanut bulge in the orbital density distributions for high-[Mg/Fe] stars with [Fe/H] $ \ge -0.6 $, transitioning toward a more spheroidal structure at lower metallicities. Additionally, $ \overline V_\phi$ ([Fe/H]) increases steeply as metallicity rises from about [Fe/H] $ \sim -1.3 $, resembling the spin-up observed at larger Galactic radii. This is accompanied by a transition in the dominant orbit families, from co- and counter-rotating cloud A and $ \rm x_4 $ orbits at low metallicities to co-rotating bar-supporting $ \rm x_1 $ family tree, box, and cloud A orbits at solar metallicity. Our results strengthen the case that the bulk of the high-[Mg/Fe] component in the bar region evolved from an alpha-enhanced disc, while metal-poor stars with [Fe/H] $ < -1 $ trace a more turbulent origin.

 - **Abstract**
 Aims. We aim to identify and classify BCs using high-precision astrometric and kinematic data, and to investigate their physical properties, mutual gravitational interactions, and formation rates. Methods. We used a comprehensive star cluster catalog that contains 4,084 high-quality clusters. Based on spatial and kinematic proximity, we identified 400 cluster pairs involving 686 unique clusters. These pairs were classified into three types: primordial BCs, systems formed through tidal capture or resonant trapping, and hyperbolic encounter pairs. For each system, we calculated the tidal factor to quantify the strength of mutual tidal interaction. Additionally, we constructed multi-cluster systems by identifying transitive connections among cluster pairs. Results. Among the 400 identified cluster pairs, nearly 60.8% (243 pairs) are probably primordial BCs, exhibiting both similar ages and motions. This supports a scenario where they formed together in the same giant molecular cloud. We find that 82.5% of the cluster pairs have strong mutual tidal forces. In addition, 278 star clusters are identified as members of 82 multi-cluster systems, including 27 newly reported groups. Cross-matching with the literature confirms the recovery of previously reported systems and leads to the discovery of 268 new cluster pairs. In our sample, about 16.8% of star clusters are involved in some type of interaction with another cluster, and 9.94% of star clusters are likely born in primordial BCs. Conclusions. Our results provide a comprehensive, homogeneously identified sample of Galactic BCs. The high fraction of primordial BCs and their mutual tidal interaction suggest that cluster formation in pairs is a main outcome of star formation. This work offers new observational constraints on the formation and dynamical evolution of multiple star cluster systems.

#### CWT-LSTM Autoencoder: A Novel Approach for Gravitational Wave Detection in Synthetic Data
 - **Authors:** Jericho Cain

 - **Abstract**
 Gravitational wave detection requires sophisticated signal processing to identify weak astrophysical signals buried in instrumental noise. Traditional matched filtering approaches face computational challenges with diverse signal morphologies and non-stationary noise. This work presents a deep learning approach combining Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) preprocessing with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) autoencoder architecture for gravitational wave detection in synthetic data. The CWT provides optimal time-frequency decomposition capturing chirp evolution and transient characteristics essential for compact binary coalescence identification. The LSTM autoencoder learns compressed representations while maintaining sensitivity to subtle signal features distinguishing true astrophysical events from noise artifacts. We generate realistic synthetic datasets incorporating binary black hole merger signals with masses ranging from 10 to 80 solar masses, embedded in colored Gaussian noise representative of Advanced LIGO sensitivity. The trained model demonstrates strong performance metrics: 92.3 percent precision, 67.6 percent recall, and 80.6 percent AUC-ROC, with an average precision score of 0.780. These results exceed LIGO's stringent detection thresholds for confident gravitational wave identification. Compared to traditional approaches, the CWT-LSTM autoencoder shows superior ability to maintain low false alarm rates while preserving sensitivity to weak signals. The method's end-to-end learning eliminates hand-crafted features and template banks, offering a promising pathway toward more robust gravitational wave detection systems. The unsupervised nature enables discovery of signals with unknown morphologies, providing complementary "blind search" capability for detecting exotic astrophysical sources and novel physics beyond current theoretical models.

 - **Abstract**
 This thesis conducts a systematic review of the applications of Lagrange points within the solar system, utilizing Systems Theory to frame these applications in terms of their interdependencies and potential for integration into broader space mission architectures. By analyzing various applications across domains such as astronomical research, space exploration, space resource utilizations, national defense, and space communication, this study identifies key areas where Lagrange points offer significant advantages. The research employs a qualitative analysis of existing literature combined with theoretical modeling to demonstrate how these points can be optimally utilized in future space missions. The finding suggests that a Systems Theory approach not only clarifies the roles and benefits of Lagrange points in space mission design but also reveals new pathways for enhancing mission efficiency and effectiveness. This thesis underscores the importance of a holistic view in the strategic planning of space missions and provides a foundational approach for integrating Lagrange points into future exploratory and operational frameworks.

 - **Abstract**
 The Rosette Nebula is a well-known H II region shaped by the interaction of gas with the OB stars of the NGC 2244 stellar association. Located within the remnant of a giant molecular cloud, it exhibits a complex structure of ionized gas, molecular material, dust, and embedded clusters. In October 2023, the region was observed as part of the SDSS-V Local Volume Mapper (LVM) integral field spectroscopy survey. Covering a radius of approximately 1 degree, the dataset comprises 33,326 spectra with spatially resolved information spanning 390 - 980 nm. We present a structural analysis of the ionized, molecular, and dusty components using multi-wavelength observations: optical spectroscopy from SDSS-V LVM, 12CO emission from PMO/MWISP (sub-millimeter), and dust emission from WISE (12 micron) and Herschel (far-infrared). These datasets were complemented with the positions of ionizing stars to study emission structures traced by H alpha, H beta, [O III], [N II], and [S II], as well as the spatial distribution of line ratios (H alpha/H beta, [O III]/H beta, [N II]/H alpha, and [S II]/H alpha) relative to the surrounding molecular cloud. Our analysis reveals interaction zones between ionized and neutral gas, including filaments, globules, and dense regions with or without ongoing star formation. Radial and quadrant-based flux profiles further highlight morphological and ionization variations, supporting the scenario in which the Rosette Nebula evolved from a non-homogeneous molecular cloud with a thin, sheet-like structure.

 - **Abstract**
 It is thought that the Universe went through an early period known as the Dark Ages, during which primeval density fluctuations grew to form the first luminous objects, marking the beginning of Cosmic Dawn around 100 million years after the Big Bang. The 21-cm line of hydrogen atoms is the most promising probe of these epochs, with extensive observational efforts underway. We combine hydrodynamical simulations with a large-scale grid in order to precisely calculate the effect of non-linear structure formation on the global (sky-averaged) 21-cm radio intensity. We show that it presents a potential opportunity to probe the properties of dark matter in a new regime, corresponding to a length-scale of only 150,000 light years and a mass-scale of 20 million Solar masses. This effect can in principle be detected unambiguously during the Dark Ages, where the weak signal requires an array of global signal antennae. During Cosmic Dawn, when stellar radiation boosts the signal, a single global antenna suffices, but the clumping effect must then be separated from the effect of the stars. Our findings open new avenues for testing the nature of dark matter as well as non-standard cosmological models.
#### Probing small-scale dark matter clumping with the large-scale 21-cm power spectrum

 - **Abstract**
 The 21-cm line of hydrogen is the most promising probe of the Dark Ages and Cosmic Dawn. We combine hydrodynamical simulations with a large-scale grid in order to calculate the effect of non-linear structure formation on the large-scale 21-cm power spectrum, focusing on redshifts $z=20-40$. As the clumping effect arises from small-scale density fluctuations, it offers a unique opportunity to probe the standard cold dark matter model in a new regime and thus potentially investigate the properties of dark matter. To this end, we also study a warm dark matter $-$ like model with a Gaussian cutoff on a scale of 50 kpc. We find that clumping has a significant impact on the large-scale 21-cm power spectrum. For example, for the Dark Ages case at $z=30$ and wavenumber $k=0.05$ Mpc$^{-1}$, small-scale clustering enhances the 21-cm power spectrum by $13\%$. Once Lyman-$\alpha$ coupling kicks in due to the first stars, the 21-cm signal strengthens, and the effect of clumping grows; it suppresses the observable power spectrum at $z=20$ by a factor of two, while the cutoff model has less than half the clumping impact. The clumping effect is significantly higher than the sensitivity of the planned Square Kilometre Array (SKA) AA$^\star$ configuration, by up to a factor of 20 for standard cold dark matter, though detection will require separation from foregrounds and from astrophysical contributions to the 21-cm power spectrum.
#### Demystifying Strange O VI Line Widths with Hydrodynamic Simulations

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.11351

 - **Abstract**
 We present a survey of O VI line widths obtained from hydrodynamic simulations that model the mixing between High Velocity Clouds and the circumgalactic medium and track the non-equilibrium ionization populations of the ions. We run 10 simulations with various physical conditions of the clouds and ambient environments, so that our results can be compared to observations of various cloud environments. Synthetic spectra are created for the simulated sight lines that contain O VI. The range of our Doppler broadening parameter, $b$, is from $\sim$6 km s$^{-1}$ to $\sim$107 km s$^{-1}$. We calculate the thermal and non-thermal contributions to the $b$ values. Both $b$ and the thermal contribution to $b$ can be substantially less than the CIE value. These narrow line widths are due to the time delay in recombination from O VI to O V in mixing regions, which results in substantial amounts of O VI at temperatures below the 2.9 $\times$ 10$^{5}$ K CIE temperature. Our results show that non equilibrium collisional ionization and mixing can produce the narrow line widths that are seen in multiple observations.
#### Role of magnetic shear distribution on the formation of eruptive flux ropes

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.11416

 - **Abstract**
 Erupting flux ropes play crucial role in powering a wide range of solar transients, including flares, jets, and coronal mass ejections. These events are driven by the release of stored magnetic energy, facilitated by the shear in the complex magnetic topologies. However, the mechanisms governing the formation and eruption of flux ropes, particularly the role of magnetic shear distribution in coronal arcades are not fully understood. We employ magnetohydrodynamic simulations incorporating nonadiabatic effects of optically thin radiative losses, magnetic field-aligned thermal conduction, and spatially varying (steady) background heating, to realistically model the coronal environment. A stratified solar atmosphere under gravity is initialized with a non-force-free field comprising sheared arcades. We study two different cases by varying the initial shear to analyze their resulting dynamics, and the possibility of flux rope formation and eruptions. Our results show that strong initial magnetic shear leads to spontaneous flux rope formation and eruption via magnetic reconnection, driven by Lorentz force. The shear distribution infers the non-potentiality distributed along arcades and demonstrates its relevance in identifying sites prone to eruptive activity. The evolution of mean shear and the relative strength between guide to reconnection fields during the pre- and post-eruption phases are explored, with implications of bulk heating for the ``hot onset'' phenomena in flares, and particle acceleration. On the other hand, the weaker shear case does not lead to formation of any flux ropes. Our findings highlight the limitations of relying solely on foot point shear and underscore the need for coronal scale diagnostics. These results are relevant for understanding eruptive onset conditions and can promote a better interpretation of coronal observations from current and future missions.
#### Dense Molecular Ring-like structure in gaseous CO depletion region G34.74-0.12

 - **Abstract**
 We report the discovery of a dense molecular ring-like structure in a dense (10$^5$ cm$^{-3}$), cold (pc-scale CO depletion at a factor of 5), and young (10$^4$ year) star-forming region G34.74-0.12, revealed by C$^{18}$O (2-1), HNC (1-0), and N$_2$H$^+$ (1-0) observations with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). The ring-like structure is redshifted with respect to the clump, spanning from $V_{\rm sys,lsr} + 0.9$ to $V_{\rm sys,lsr} + 2.9$ km s$^{-1}$, with a total mass of 109 $M_{\odot}$. It is spatially coincident with 1.3 mm and 3.0 mm dust continuum emission from cores, and several protostellar outflows. However, no free-free emission or H\textsc{ii} region is detected in association with this structure. With a slow expansion speed indicated by the position-velocity diagram, this ring structure differs from rings previously identified in more evolved star-forming regions. Possible explanations for the ring-like structure include a relic wind-blown bubble produced by a deeply embedded young stellar object, a hollow cavity formed by cloud-cloud interactions, a gas ring resulting from a temperature gradient, or a line-of-sight superposition of multiple outflows or dense clouds. This discovery offers a rare observational glimpse into the earliest dynamical processes involved in massive star formation.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding the processes associated with coronal rain due to the thermal non-equilibrium (TNE) and thermal instability (TI) scenario can help us understand coronal heating. We aim to study the properties of a quiescent coronal rain event and its effect on the solar atmosphere. We utilise space-based data from the \textit{High-Resolution Imager in Extreme Ultraviolet} of Solar Orbiter, the \textit{Atmospheric Imaging Assembly} of the Solar Dynamics Observatory, and the Slit-Jaw Imager (SJI) from the \textit{Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph} from November 1st, 2023. During the coronal rain shower, the coronal loop exhibits large EUV variability and drastic changes in sub-structure. Coronal rain clumps with total velocities between 72~km~s$^{-1}$ and 87~km~s$^{-1}$ and cool EUV absorbing core sizes of $\approx$600~km and densities of $\approx5\times10^{11}$~cm$^{-3}$ are seen to fall with a strong compression ahead. During the compression we measure a low polytropic index with $\gamma=1.085$, suggesting the presence of molecules. The rain shower carries a total of $3.09\times10^{26}$~erg, and the clumps produce impacts seen in all EUV channels and in SJI~1400~Å. The impacts generate hot rebound flows with temperatures of $10^{6.2}-10^{6.3}~$K and velocities of $85-87$ km~s$^{-1}$, which refill and reheat the loop but carry less than $20\%$ of the clumps' kinetic energies. We find signatures of a steady footpoint heating, in agreement with the TNE-TI scenario, with an estimated amplitude of $2.56\times10^{-2}~$erg~cm$^{-3}$~s$^{-1}$ in agreement with active region estimates. Coronal rain may therefore be a good proxy for the total integrated heating that gives birth to TNE-TI.

 - **Abstract**
 The strong gravitational pull of the neutron star leads to the accretion of dark matter (DM) inside the core of the neutron star. The accretion of DM affects the bulk properties of the neutron star. Here, we study how the accretion of WIMP (Weakly Interacting Massive Particles) dark matter particles affects the $\Delta-$admixed hyperon star's bulk properties specifically mass, radius, tidal deformability, $f-$mode frequency and moment of inertia. The inclusion of dark matter softens the EOS (equation of state) and reduces the maximum possible mass, canonical radius, canonical tidal deformability, and moment of inertia of canonical star. However, the $f-$mode frequency of the canonical star increases. We find a cubical correlation between the dark matter fermi momenta $k_f^{DM}$ and bulk properties of canonical star.

 - **Abstract**
 We report JWST NIRCAM and MIRI observations of Sgr B2, the most active site of star formation in the Galaxy. These observations, using 14 filters spanning 1.5 to 25 microns, have revealed a multilayered and highly structured cloud that contains both a revealed, low-extinction and hidden, high-extinction population of massive stars. JWST has detected new candidate HII regions around massive stars previously missed by radio telescopes. MIRI has detected radiation escaping from the forming massive cluster Sgr B2 N along its outflow cavities, demonstrating that infrared radiation finds geometric escape routes even in the densest, most heavily embedded regions in the universe. JWST further highlights the gas asymmetry in the cloud, showing a sharp, straight cutoff along the eastern cloud edge. Despite the great sensitivity of these observations, no extended population of YSOs has been detected, placing a limit on their minimum extinction; this result hints that star formation has only just begun in the cloud. Together, these results suggest that, despite already holding the crown for most actively star-forming cloud, we have underestimated the total star formation in Sgr B2. JWST unveils previously hidden massive stars and ionized structures, offering a transformative view of how stars form under some of the most extreme Galactic conditions.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding the formation and evolution of stellar-mass binary black holes (BBHs) requires a thorough investigation of the key physical processes involved. While one pathway involves the isolated evolution of massive binary stars, affected by uncertain stages like core-collapse supernovae and common envelope evolution, an alternative channel is dynamical formation in dense stellar environments. Newtonian gravity has traditionally provided a robust and computationally efficient framework for modeling large-scale gravitational interactions. However, accurately capturing close encounters and black hole mergers necessitates the use of general relativity. This work focuses on assessing the applicability of post-Newtonian gravity in bridging these regimes, offering a physically insightful and computationally tractable approach to modeling BBH formation in the gravitational-wave era of astronomy.

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar flybys are likely to be common in young star-forming regions and could be responsible for substructures observed in protoplanetary discs. Using three-dimensional smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations, we study dust trapping in discs perturbed by parabolic coplanar flybys. We find that spiral structures are induced in the gas and dust discs for both prograde and retrograde encounters. By tracking individual dust particles within the flyby-induced substructures, we determine that they have a highly enhanced dust to gas ratio compared to particles in an unperturbed disc. We further find that the local dust to gas ratios in flyby-induced substructures are sufficiently high to trigger the streaming instability and hence facilitate planetesimal formation in young discs.

 - **Abstract**
 Aims. We explore frequency-dependent changes in pulsar radio emission by analyzing their profile widths and emission heights, assessing whether the simple radius-to-frequency mapping (RFM) or the fan beam model can describe the data. Methods. Using wideband (704-4032 MHz) Murriyang (Parkes) observations of over 100 pulsars, we measured profile widths at multiple intensity levels, fit Gaussian components, and used aberration-retardation effects to estimate emission altitudes. We compared trends in width evolution and emission height with a fan beam model. Results. Similar to other recent studies, we find that while many pulsars show profiles narrowing with increasing frequency, a substan- tial fraction show the reverse. The Gaussian decomposition of the profiles reveals that the peak locations of the components vary little with frequency. However, the component widths do, in general, narrow with increasing frequency. This argues that propagation effects are responsible for the width evolution of the profiles rather than emission height. Overall, the evolution of the emission height with frequency is unclear, and clouded by the assumptions in the model. Spin-down luminosity correlates weakly with profile narrowing but not with emission height. Conclusions. The classic picture where pulsars emit at a single emission height which decreases with increasing observing frequency cannot explain the diversity in behavior observed here. Instead, pulsar beams likely originate from extended regions at multiple altitudes, with fan-beam or patchy structures dominating their frequency evolution. Future models must incorporate realistic plasma physics and multi-altitude emission to capture the range of pulsar behaviors.
#### STRAWBERRY: Finding haloes in the gravitational potential

 - **Abstract**
 Here, we present a novel algorithm that discriminates between bound and unbound particles by consideration of the gravitational potential from an accelerated reference frame -- also referred to as `the boosted potential'. Particles are considered bound if their energy does not exceed the escape energy of a potential well -- given by the closest saddle-point that connects to a deeper potential minimum. This approach has core benefits over previous approaches, since it does not require any ad-hoc thresholds (such as over-density criteria), it includes the gravitational effect of all particles in the binding criterion (improving over widely used self-potential binding checks) and it only operates with instantaneous information (making it simpler than approaches based on dynamical histories). We show that particles typically become bound between their first peri- and apo-centeric passage and that bound and unbound populations show very distinct characteristics through their distribution in phase space, their density profiles, their virial ratios, and their redshift evolution. Our findings suggest that it is possible to understand haloes as two-component systems, with one component being bound, virialized, of finite extent and evolving slowly in quasi-equilibrium and the other component being unbound, unvirialized and evolving rapidly.

 - **Abstract**
 How the event rate of fast radio bursts (FRBs) evolves with redshift is a hot topic to explore their cosmological origin and the circum-burst environment. Particularly, it is urgent to know what the difference of event rates between repeating and non-repeating FRBs is. For the first time, we calculate the event rates of repeating FRBs detected by diverse telescopes at frequencies higher/lower than 1 GHz in this work. Luminosity and redshift are found to be positively correlated with a power law form for both high- and low-frequency FRBs, showing an obvious evolution of luminosity with redshift. Furthermore, we compare the differential luminosity and local event rate distributions of high- and low-luminosity FRBs at different frequencies. It is found that the event rates of these sub-samples of repeating FRBs similarly exceed the star formation rate at lower redshift than 1. Interestingly, we confirm with bootstrap method that the event rates of low-frequency FRBs exhibit different evolution patterns and are higher than that of high-frequency ones.

 - **Abstract**
 As the scientific exploitation of the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) approaches, there is a need for new advanced data analysis and visualization tools capable of processing large high-dimensional datasets. In this study, we aim to generalize the YOLO-CIANNA deep learning source detection and characterization method for 3D hyperspectral HI emission cubes. We present the adaptations we made to the regression-based detection formalism and the construction of an end-to-end 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) backbone. We then describe a processing pipeline for applying the method to simulated 3D HI cubes from the SKA Observatory Science Data Challenge 2 (SDC2) dataset. The YOLO-CIANNA method was originally developed and used by the MINERVA team that won the official SDC2 competition. Despite the public release of the full SDC2 dataset, no published result has yet surpassed MINERVA's top score. In this paper, we present an updated version of our method that improves our challenge score by 9.5%. The resulting catalog exhibits a high detection purity of 92.3%, best-in-class characterization accuracy, and contains 45% more confirmed sources than concurrent classical detection tools. The method is also computationally efficient, processing the full ~1TB SDC2 data cube in 30 min on a single GPU. These state-of-the-art results highlight the effectiveness of 3D CNN-based detectors for processing large hyperspectral data cubes and represent a promising step toward applying YOLO-CIANNA to observational data from SKA and its precursors.
#### High-energy interstellar isomers: cis-N-methylformamide in the G+0.693-0.027 molecular cloud

 - **Abstract**
 Isomerism in complex organic molecules provides key insights into the formation mechanisms and physical conditions of the interstellar medium (ISM). Among the C$_2$H$_5$NO isomers, only acetamide and trans-N-methylformamide (trans-NMF) have been detected in space. The recent detection of higher-energy isomers in other chemical families raises questions about the formation and abundance of less stable isomers. We used ultra-sensitive wide-band spectral surveys obtained with the Yebes 40 m and IRAM 30 m telescopes to search for cis-NMF towards the Galactic Centre molecular cloud G+0.693-0.027. We present the first detection of cis-NMF in the ISM, with 55 unblended or slightly blended transitions, 44 of which were new transitions identified based on extrapolated spectroscopic data. Due to the lack of collisional rate coefficients, a quasi-non-LTE analysis, which separated the transitions into different K$_a$ ladders, was used to determine the excitation conditions. The resulting trans/cis-NMF isomeric ratio of 2.9$\pm$0.6 deviates significantly from thermodynamic expectations, suggesting that kinetic non-equilibrium processes and stereospecific chemical pathways are responsible for the formation of cis-NMF in this environment. The detection of cis-NMF expands the known inventory of interstellar C$_2$H$_5$NO isomers and challenges the assumption that isomer abundances strictly correlate with thermodynamic stability. Laboratory and theoretical studies propose formation via CH$_3$NCO hydrogenation or spin-forbidden reactions involving CH$_2$ and NH$_2$CHO, though these may not reflect typical ISM conditions. This finding highlights the need for further investigation into isomerisation mechanisms and constrains astrochemical models of complex organic molecules.

 Under the core-accretion model, gas giants form via runaway accretion. This process starts when the mass of the accreted envelope becomes equal to the mass of the core. Here, we model a population of warm sub-Saturns to search for imprints of their formation history in their internal structure. Using the GAS gianT modeL for Interiors (GASTLI), we calculate a grid of interior structure models on which we perform retrievals for our sample of 28 sub-Saturns to derive their envelope mass fractions ($f_{env}$). For each planet, we run three different retrievals assuming low (-2.0 < log(Fe/H) < 0.5), medium ( 0.5 < log(Fe/H) < 1.4), and high (1.4 < log(Fe/H) < 1.7) atmospheric metallicity. The distribution of $f_{env}$ in our sample is then compared to predictions of planet formation models. When compared to the outcomes of a planetesimal accretion model, we find that we require medium to high atmospheric metallicities to reproduce the simulated planet population. Additionally, we find a bimodal distribution of $f_{env}$ in our sample with a gap that is located at different values of $f_{env}$ for different atmospheric metallicities. For the high atmospheric metallicity case, the gap in the $f_{env}$ distribution is located between 0.5 and 0.7, which is consistent with assumptions by the core-accretion model where runaway accretion starts when $M_{env} \approx M_{core}$ ($f_{env} \sim 0.5$). We also find a bimodal distribution of the hydrogen and helium mass fraction ($f_{H/He}$) with a gap at $f_{H/He} = 0.3$. The location of this gap is independent of the assumed atmospheric metallicity. Lastly, we compare the distributions of our sub-Saturns in the Neptunian savanna to a population of sub-Saturns in the Neptune desert and ridge. We find that the observed $f_{env}$ distribution of savanna and ridge sub-Saturns is consistent with the planets coming from the same underlying population.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a steady-state analytical model for pressure-regulated formation of molecular clouds (MC) and stars (SF) in gaseous galactic disks and apply it to the Milky Way (MW). MC formation depends on midplane interstellar pressure $P_{\text{ISM}}$ and metallicity $Z$, and for galactocentric distances $R\gtrsim5$ kpc, $P_{\text{ISM}}(R)$ scales approximately linearly with molecular gas surface density $\Sigma_{\rm mol}(R)$. The molecularization of the cold neutral medium (CNM) is due to the opacity of small dust grains that protect the center of the cloud from dissociating radiation when the column density is $\Sigma_d\geq 5\ (Z/Z_\odot)M_\odot\text{ pc}^{-2}$. The H$_2$ formation rate per hydrogen atom is $F\sim10^{-15}(P_{\text{ISM}}/P_\odot)T_{100}^{-1/2}\text{s}^{-1}$, and the corresponding formation rate per unit area is $\dot{\Sigma}^{+}_{\rm mol}\sim 5\times10^{-2}\left(P_{\text{ISM}}/{P_\odot}\right)T_{100}^{-1/2}M_\odot~\text{kpc}^{-2}~\text{yr}^{-1}$, where $P_\odot$ is the pressure at the solar circle and $T_{100}=T/100\text{ K}$ is the temperature of the cloud. In equilibrium, this equals the molecular gas destruction rate $\dot{\Sigma}^{-}_{\rm mol}$ due to SF. Self-gravity sets in when the column density of a cloud reaches $\Sigma_{\rm sg}=\Sigma_{\rm sg,\odot}(P_{\text{ISM}}/P_\odot)^{1/2}$, with $\Sigma_{\rm sg,\odot}\sim30\ M_\odot\ \text{pc}^{-2}$. Given the distribution of $P_{\text{ISM}}(R)$ and $Z(R)$ in the MW, the SF process at $5\lesssim R\lesssim11$ kpc follows a two-step track: first, MCs form from CNM gas and then they form stars when self-gravity sets in. The resulting SFR surface density is $\Sigma_\text{SFR}(R)\approx (1.6-4)\times10^{-3}\left(P_{\text{ISM}}/P_\odot\right)\ \text{M}_\odot~\text {kpc}^{-2}\text{yr}^{-1}$ with an average final SF efficiency of $\epsilon_{\rm sf}\sim (3-8)\times 10^{-2}$.

 - **Abstract**
 We present results from the Chandra X-ray Observatory Large Project (878 ks in 28 observations) of the Large Magellanic Cloud supernova remnant N132D. We measure the expansion of the forward shock in the bright southern rim to be $0.\!^{\prime\prime}10 \pm 0.\!^{\prime\prime}02$ over the $\sim14.5$ yr baseline, which corresponds to a velocity of $1620\pm400~\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$ after accounting for several instrumental effects. We measure an expansion of $0.\!^{\prime\prime}23 \pm 0.\!^{\prime\prime}02$ and a shock velocity of $3840\pm260~\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$ for two features in an apparent blowout region in the northeast. The emission-measure-weighted average temperature inferred from X-ray spectral fits to regions in the southern rim is $0.95\pm0.17$ keV, consistent with the electron temperature implied by the shock velocity after accounting for Coulomb equilibration and adiabatic expansion. In contrast, the emission-measure-weighted average temperature for the northeast region is $0.77\pm0.04$ keV, which is significantly lower than the value inferred from the shock velocity. We fit 1-D evolutionary models for the shock in the southern rim and northeast region, using the measured radius and propagation velocity into a constant density and power-law profile circumstellar medium. We find good agreement with the age of $\sim2500$ years derived from optical expansion measurements for explosion energies of $1.5-3.0 \times 10^{51}\,\mathrm{erg}$, ejecta masses of $2-6 \,\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ and ambient medium densities of $\sim0.33-0.66$ $\mathrm{amu~cm}^{-3}$ in the south and $\sim0.01-0.02$ $\mathrm{amu~cm}^{-3}$ in the northeast assuming a constant density medium. These results are consistent with previous studies that suggested the progenitor of N132D was an energetic supernova that exploded into a pre-existing cavity.

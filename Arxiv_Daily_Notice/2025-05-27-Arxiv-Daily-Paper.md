 - **Abstract**
 Separating resolved and unresolved sources in large imaging surveys is a fundamental step to enable downstream science, such as searching for extragalactic transients in wide-field time-domain surveys. Here we present our method to effectively separate point sources from the resolved, extended sources in the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Legacy Surveys (LS). We develop a supervised machine-learning model based on the Gradient Boosting algorithm \texttt{XGBoost}. The features input to the model are purely morphological and are derived from the tabulated LS data products. We train the model using $\sim$$2\times10^5$ LS sources in the COSMOS field with HST morphological labels and evaluate the model performance on LS sources with spectroscopic classification from the DESI Data Release 1 ($\sim$$2\times10^7$ objects) and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 17 ($\sim$$3\times10^6$ objects), as well as on $\sim$$2\times10^8$ Gaia stars. A significant fraction of LS sources are not observed in every LS filter, and we therefore build a ``Hybrid'' model as a linear combination of two \texttt{XGBoost} models, each containing features combining aperture flux measurements from the ``blue'' ($gr$) and ``red'' ($iz$) filters. The Hybrid model shows a reasonable balance between sensitivity and robustness, and achieves higher accuracy and flexibility compared to the LS morphological typing. With the Hybrid model, we provide classification scores for $\sim$$3\times10^9$ LS sources, making this the largest ever machine-learning catalog separating resolved and unresolved sources. The catalog has been incorporated into the real-time pipeline of the La Silla Schmidt Southern Survey (LS4), enabling the identification of extragalactic transients within the LS4 alert stream.
#### Asteroseismology of WD J004917.14-252556.81, the Most Massive Pulsating White Dwarf

 - **Abstract**
 We present extensive follow-up time-series photometry of WD J0049$-$2525, the most massive pulsating white dwarf currently known with $T_{\rm eff} = 13\, 020\,{\rm K}$ and $\log{\it g} = 9.34$ cm s$^{-2}$. The discovery observations detected only two significant pulsation modes. Here, we report the detection of 13 significant pulsation modes ranging from 170 to 258 s based on 11 nights of observations with the New Technology Telescope, Gemini, and Apache Point Observatory telescopes. We use these 13 modes to perform asteroseismology and find that the best-fitting models (under the assumption of an ONe core composition) have $M_{\star} \approx 1.29~M_\odot$, surface hydrogen layer mass of $\log(M_{\rm H}/M_{\star}) \lesssim -7.5$, and a crystallized core fraction of $>99\%$. An analysis of the period spacing also strongly suggests a very high mass. The asteroseismic distance derived is in good agreement with the distance provided by Gaia. We also find tentative evidence of a rotation period of 0.3 or 0.67 d. This analysis provides the first look at the interior of a $\sim 1.3~M_{\odot}$ white dwarf.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent observations of convection in the jovian atmosphere have demonstrated that convection is strongly concentrated at specific locations on planet. For instance, observations of lightning show that the cyclonic features (e.g,. belts and folded filamentary regions - FFRs) show increased convective activity compared to anti-cyclonic regions. Meanwhile, the distribution of ammonia and water vapor show a large enrichment near the equator, which is also suggestive of strong upwelling and convective activity. Marrying these different observations is challenging due to a lack of data concerning the characteristics of the deep jovian atmosphere, and a resulting inability to observe the true deep source of the various convective phenomena. To understand the nature of these convective events and \paperedit{the role of the } structure of the deep atmosphere \paperedit{in driving convective events}, we run simulations of cloud formation and convection using the Explicit Planetary hybrid-Isentropic Coordinate General Circulation Model (EPIC GCM). We vary the dynamics of the atmosphere by parameterizing the deep wind shear and studying the resulting effect on the strength, frequency and distribution of convective storms. We find that convection in our model is strongly tied to the local dynamics and the deep wind shear. We further decompose the generation of convective available potential energy (CAPE) into three components (thermal, mechanical, and moist/chemical), and find that the chemical mechanism is the strongest component, working to advect water vapor from moisture-rich regions to moisture-poor regions and to drive convection along a ``moisture front.''

 - **Abstract**
 It is unknown if an Oort cloud reaches its maximum mass within its star's birth cluster or millions of years later. Complicating the Oort cloud evolution process is the fact that comets can be stripped from orbit due to perturbations from passing stars. We explore how a star's cluster escape time (t$_{ \rm esc}$) and the time its Oort cloud reaches maximum mass (t$_{ \rm max}$) affect the Oort cloud's ability to survive via $N$-body simulations. In a 14 M$_\odot$/pc$^3$ cluster, we identify 50 stars of 1 M$_\odot$ with a range of t$_{ \rm esc}$ to host Oort clouds, each with 1000 comets at t$_{ \rm max}$. For each host, we consider Oort clouds that reach maximum mass 0, 50, and 250 Myr after the cluster's formation. Each Oort cloud's evolution is simulated in the cluster from t$_{ \rm max}$ to t$_{ \rm esc}$. Only a fraction of comets tend to remain in orbit, with this amount depending on t$_{ \rm max}$ and t$_{ \rm esc}$. We observe that 12%, 22%, and 32% of Oort clouds with a t$_{ \rm max}$ of 0, 50 and 250 Myr retain >50% of their comets at t$_{ \rm esc}$, respectively. We find that the fraction of comets stripped has the relationship, $\rm f=m\log_{10}(\frac{t_{ \rm esc}-t_{ \rm max}}{Myr})$ where m = 0.32$\pm$0.04, indicating that the longer the Oort cloud remains in the cluster, the more comets are stripped, with this fraction increasing logarithmically at approximately the same rate for each t$_{ \rm max}$.

 - **Abstract**
 High-mass star formation involves complex processes, with the hot core phase playing a crucial role in chemical enrichment and the formation of complex organic molecules. However, molecular inventories in hot cores remain limited. Using data from the ALMA Three-millimeter Observations of Massive Star-forming regions survey (ATOMS), the molecular composition and evolutionary stages of two distinct millimeter continuum sources in the high-mass star forming region G336.99-00.03 have been characterized. MM1, with 19 distinct molecular species detected, along with 8 isotopologues and several vibrationally/torsionally excited states, has been identified as a hot core. MM2 with only 5 species identified, was defined as a HII region. Isotopic ratios in MM1 were derived, with $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ranging from 16.0 to 29.2, $^{16}$O/$^{18}$O at 47.7, and $^{32}$S/$^{34}$S at 19.2. Molecular abundances in MM1 show strong agreement with other sources and three-phase warm-up chemical models within an order of magnitude for most species. Formation pathways of key molecules were explored, revealing chemical links and reaction networks. This study provides a detailed molecular inventory of two millimeter continuum sources, shedding light on the chemical diversity and evolutionary processes in high-mass star-forming regions. The derived molecular parameters and isotopic ratios offer benchmarks for astrochemical models, paving the way for further investigation into the formation and evolution of complex organic molecules during the hot core phase.

 - **Abstract**
 Accretion onto supermassive black hole (SMBH) releases energy via radiation, jets or winds, providing feedback effects on the circumnuclear gas environment. However, the dynamics of accreting gas on sub-parsec scales near the SMBH remains poorly understood. With high-resolution X-ray spectra of Mrk 3, we detect a fast inflowing ionized absorber characterized by redshifted Fe XXV and Fe XXVI absorption lines. Photoionization modeling reveals the inflowing absorber is located at $\lesssim0.04-0.74\rm~pc$ and is decelerating from $6.1\pm0.5\times10^3\rm~km~s^{-1}$ to $3.4\pm0.3\times10^3\rm~km~s^{-1}$ over 11 years. Only $\sim0.6$\%--$3$\% of the inflowing material is estimated to reach the event horizon. This direct evidence of sub-parsec scale fueling inflow bridges the gap between the torus and the outer accretion disk. Furthermore, a $0.86$-keV gas component with sub-solar metallicity ($Z\sim0.22$), outflowing at a velocity of $\sim330\rm~km~s^{-1}$, is detected in the soft X-ray band. It may corresponds to the [O III] biconical outflow in the narrow-line region. A putative ultra-fast disk wind outside our line-of-sight, or clouds within the broad-line region, are promising candidates for decelerating the inflowing absorber.

 - **Abstract**
 Magnetic flux emergence is traditionally considered a key trigger of solar filament eruptions; however, its role in suppressing filament eruptions remains less understood. Using multi-wavelength observations from the Solar Dynamics Observatory, this study investigates a unique case of flux emergence below a quiescent filament from January 3 to 5, 2016, where the newly emerging magnetic flux suppressed rather than promoted the eruption of the filament. It is found that the emerging magnetic bipole within the filament channel directly interacted and reconnected with the overlying filament magnetic field and produced a series of two-sided coronal jets along the filament axis. Instead of eruption, the filament kept stable but broke into two segments at the reconnection site. Further magnetic cancellation or recession of the emerged bipole allowed the filament to recover its original structure. Our analysis results revealed that the flux emergence suppressed the filament eruption by reducing the upward net force. The formation and evolution of filament fine structures, such as filament threads, are closely linked to the reconnection processes between the emerging bipole and the horizontal magnetic field of the filament. This study provides direct observational evidence for the stabilization of solar filaments driven by flux emergence, offering new insights into the dual role of magnetic emergence in triggering and suppressing solar eruptions.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we explore the production of primordial black holes (PBHs) within the context of $\alpha$-attractor inflationary models, focusing on the preheating phase following inflation. During this phase, self-resonance instabilities arise due to deviations of the inflationary potential from a quadratic form. PBH formation is analyzed using three criteria: (1) the perturbation must lie within the instability band, (2) its characteristic length must exceed the Jeans length, and (3) it must have sufficient time to collapse based on the estimations of massive scalar field spherical collapse in Einstein-de Sitter universe. Based on these criteria, we calculate the PBH mass fraction using the Press-Schechter (PS) and Khlopov-Polnarev (KP) formalisms. Our results show that the PS formalism tends to overestimate PBH abundance during preheating, as it neglects nonspherical effects. In contrast, the KP formalism yields more realistic predictions by incorporating such effects. We provide a detailed comparison with observational constraints from evaporating PBHs. Notably, the PS formalism is excluded by these constraints, which are based on Hawking radiation, while the KP formalism remains viable. These findings underscore the importance of accounting for nonspherical effects and accurate collapse dynamics in studies of PBH formation during preheating.

 - **Abstract**
 Ambient dark matter (DM) around binary black holes can imprint characteristic signatures on gravitational waves emitted from their merger. The exact signature depends sensitively on the DM density profile around the black holes. We run very high resolution cosmological hydrodynamics simulations of first star formation that follow the collapse of a $3\times10^{5}\,M_\odot$ mini-halo from $z=49$ to $z\simeq22$. Our flagship model achieves a DM particle mass of $3.7\times10^{-4}\,M_\odot$ and resolves the inner-most structure down to $0.02\,$pc. We show that the halo experiences a two-stage gravitational collapse, where a rotating, constant-density core with $r\lesssim3\,$pc is formed first, surrounded by an extended outskirts. Baryonic infall toward the center continues to raise the local Keplerian velocity and promotes adiabatic contraction of DM. The resulting density profile has an approximately power-law shape of $\rho_{\rm dm} \propto r^{-0.6}$ inside $\sim\!1\,$this http URL find that a piecewise power-law fit reproduces the simulation result to better than 10\%, and also find numerical convergence down to $\simeq\!0.01\,$pc. The DM density profile is typical for ordinary Pop~III halos, but our additional simulations reveal that inner slope varies significantly with halo-to-halo scatter, and the effect of Lyman-Werner irradiation and of supersonic baryon-DM streaming velocities, implying a wide distribution of slopes rather than a single universal curve. The large variation should be considered when calculating the predicted DM-induced dephasing of gravitational waves by up to an order of magnitude relative to the classical analytic model of the DM spike.

 The Barcelona Raman LIDAR (BRL) will provide continuous monitoring of the aerosol extinction profile along the line of sight of the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO). It will be located at its Northern site (CTAO-N) on the Observatorio del Roque de Los Muchachos. This article presents the performance of the pathfinder Barcelona Raman LIDAR (pBRL), a prototype instrument for the final BRL. Power budget simulations were carried out for the pBRL operating. under various conditions, including clear nights, moon conditions, and dust intrusions. The LIDAR PreProcessing (LPP) software suite is presented, which includes several new statistical methods for background subtraction, signal gluing, ground layer and cloud detection and inversion, based on two elastic and one Raman lines. Preliminary test campaigns were conducted, first close to Barcelona and later at CTAO-N, albeit during moonlit nights only. The pBRL, under these non-optimal conditions, achieves maximum ranges up to about 35 km, range resolution of about 50 m for strongly absorbing dust layers, and 500 m for optically thin clouds with the Raman channel only, leading to similar resolutions for the LIDAR ratios and Angstrom exponents. Given the reasonable agreement between the extinction coefficients obtained from the Raman and elastic lines independently, an accuracy of aerosol optical depth retrieval in the order of 0.05 can be assumed with the current setup. The results show that the pBRL can provide valuable scientific results on aerosol characteristics and structure, although not all performance requirements could be validated under the conditions found at the two test sites. Several moderate hardware improvements are planned for its final upgraded version [truncated].

 - **Abstract**
 The recent detection of very high energy (VHE, $>$ 100 GeV) $\gamma$-ray emission from gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) has provided new insights into afterglow physics. Understanding the temporal and spectral evolution of VHE GRBs requires detailed modelling of multiwavelength observations spanning radio to VHE $\gamma$ rays. Previous studies on afterglow emission of VHE GRBs were interpreted using a range of frameworks, including single- and multi-zone jet configurations, synchrotron radiation from forward and reverse shocks, synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) processes, as well as hadronic emission processes. We conducted a detailed multiwavelength modelling of five long-duration VHE GRBs - GRB 180720B, GRB 190114C, GRB 190829A, GRB 201216C and GRB 221009A; using the NAIMA code and modifications to it. The code deals with single-zone synchrotron radiation, SSC and external Compton (EC) radiation with complete Klein Nishina cross-section, extragalactic background light correction, and the Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques. Our analysis constrains key parameters governing the emission and surrounding environments of these GRBs. The results indicate that SSC is the dominant VHE emission mechanism, with negligible contribution from EC. Most VHE GRBs are well described by the forward shock model in a spherical jet configuration, where constant density interstellar medium is preferred over wind medium. Additionally, we find that VHE GRBs tend to occur in environments with lower magnetic fields and higher ambient medium densities. Interestingly, VHE GRBs lie at the edge of the 3-$\sigma$ region of the $E_{\rm k,iso}$ - $\epsilon_B$ correlation observed in other energetic GRBs. Our model slightly over predicts the radio fluxes, indicating that a more complicated modelling might be required in some cases. These findings provide crucial constraints on VHE GRB emission sites and mechanisms (Abridged).

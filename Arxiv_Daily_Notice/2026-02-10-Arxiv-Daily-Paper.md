 - **Abstract**
 The presence of multiple stellar populations in globular clusters leads to a complex dynamical environment that significantly influences the evolution of binary stars, which in turn impacts the evolution of the cluster itself. For this study, we used a series of Monte Carlo simulations run with the MOCCA code to investigate the long-term dynamical evolution of binary stars in globular clusters hosting two distinct stellar populations. We explored how global binary properties such as incidence, fraction, and spatial distribution evolve over time due to the unique dynamical environment associated with each population. Our results show how binaries in the more centrally concentrated second population (P2) experience increased rates of hardening and disruption relative to the first population (P1), leading to distinct radial profiles in binary incidence and fraction. We also demonstrate the difference in spatial mixing timescales for binaries compared to single stars, where binary stars in each population retain some memory of their initial configurations even after complete single star mixing. Additionally, we investigated the formation and evolution of mixed binaries (binaries composed of a P1 component and a P2 component), which form primarily within the core through dynamical interactions. Finally, we studied main sequence--white dwarf binaries and find that they represent a larger fraction of binaries in P1 compared to P2. The results of this paper highlight the interplay between cluster dynamics and the evolution of binary stars and how binaries can act as tracers of the cluster's initial conditions and dynamical evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 The CASPER (Collaboration for Astronomy Signal Processing and Electronic Research) toolflow is a widely used framework for designing and implementing digital signal processing systems, particularly in the field of radio astronomy. It provides a set of tools and libraries that enable researchers to create custom hardware and software solutions for processing astronomical data. The CASPER toolflow has been instrumental in the development of Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) based digital instruments for various radio telescopes, enabling for real-time data processing and analysis. However, the current frontend tool that CASPER uses for high-level FPGA design is based on Model Composer integrated into MATLAB/Simulink, which is a proprietary software. In this paper, we introduce Scilab as a new frontend tool for the CASPER toolflow. Scilab is an open-source software platform for numerical computation and data visualization, which offers a similar environment to MATLAB/Simulink for designing CASPER blocks, generating FPGA Intellectual Property (IP) cores, and simulating Digital Signal Processing (DSP) systems. We present our implementation of Scilab in the CASPER toolflow and demonstrate its capabilities by developing an FPGA based spectrometer on a RFSoC4x2, a commonly used CASPER platform well suited to radio astronomy applications. We have also developed Scilab support for other CASPER compatible platforms. Our results show that Scilab can successfully be used as an alternate frontend for CASPER-based designs.
#### Coma Volatile Composition and Thermal Physics in Comet C/2022 E3 (ZTF) Measured Near Closest Approach to Earth with NASA-IRTF

 - **Abstract**
 The 2023 perihelion passage of comet C/2022 E3 (ZTF) afforded an opportunity to measure the abundances and spatial distributions of coma volatiles in an Oort cloud comet at high spatial resolution near its close approach to Earth ($\Delta_\mathrm{min}\sim 0.28$ au on UT February 1). We conducted near-infrared spectroscopic observations of C/2022 E3 (ZTF) using iSHELL at the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility on UT 2023 February 9. Our measurements securely detected fluorescent emission from H$_2$O, CO, OCS, CH$_3$OH, CH$_4$, C$_2$H$_6$, C$_2$H$_2$, and HCN. For each instrumental setting we took exposures with the slit oriented parallel and also perpendicular to the projected Sun-comet vector, thereby enabling a test of the spatial distributions of these molecules. We report rotational temperatures, production rates, and abundance ratios (i.e., mixing ratios) for all sampled species. Our measurements found that molecular abundances in C/2022 E3 were depleted compared to their average values in Oort cloud comets with the exception of OCS, which was consistent. The H$_2$O production rate varied significantly and was likely tied to nucleus rotation effects. Measurements at the two slit orientations showed distinct column density and rotational temperature profiles for H$_2$O. Peak temperatures occurred off-nucleus and slower cooling was present in the anti-sunward hemisphere, consistent with the presence of icy grain sublimation in the coma.

 - **Abstract**
 Protoplanetary disk substructures are thought to play a crucial role in disk evolution and planet formation. Population studies of disks large-sample size surveys show that substructures, and their rapid formation, are needed to reproduce the observed spectral indices. Moreover, they enable the simultaneous reproduction of the observed spectral index and size-luminosity distributions. This study aims to investigate the necessity of substructures and predict their characteristics to reproduce gas-to-dust size ratios observed in the Lupus star-forming region. We performed a population synthesis study of gas and dust evolution in disks using a two-population model (two-pop-py) and the DustPy code. We considered the effects of viscous evolution, dust growth, fragmentation, transport, and external photoevaporation. The simulated population distributions were obtained by post-processing the resulting disk profiles of surface density, maximum grain size, and disk temperature. Although substructures help reduce the discrepancy between simulated and observed disk gas-to-dust size ratios; even when accounting for external photoevaporation, they do not fully resolve it. Only specific initial conditions in disks undergoing viscous evolution with external photoevaporation can reproduce the observations, highlighting a fine-tuning problem. While substructured disks reproduce dust size and spectral index, they tend to overestimate gas radii. The results ultimately highlight the main challenge of simultaneously reproducing gas and dust sizes. One possible explanation is that the outermost substructure is linked to the disk truncation radius, which determines the gas radius, or that substructures are frequent enough to always be near the gas outer radius.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent observations have revealed that several cosmic ray (CR) sources themselves exhibit pronounced double power-law features in their radiation spectra. Combined with the phenomenon of two-component structure in the observed CR energy spectrum supported by multi-messenger data, this raises a fundamental question: can the two-component structure of the cosmic ray energy spectrum and the double power-law feature of the gamma-ray radiation energy spectrum from supernova remnants be understood within a unified picture? In this study, we propose a two-component model that incorporates the re-acceleration of background ``sea" CR particles by astrophysical sources to systematically explain the formation of double power-law spectra within those sources. Our model successfully reproduces the gamma-ray observations of multiple CR sources. The results support that double power-law structures may be a generic feature of Galactic CR sources within crushed clouds. This work offers a new theoretical perspective on the origin and propagation of cosmic rays, and its predictions may be further tested with future observations of a larger sample of CR sources.

 - **Abstract**
 The discovery of persistent radio sources (PRSs) associated with repeating fast radio bursts (FRBs) has shed light on the immediate environments and possible progenitors of these FRBs. The confirmed PRSs may support the theory that FRB progenitors are compact central engines, whilst the non-detections suggest diversity of FRB's local environment. We perform a subarcsecond-resolution MeerKAT search at 1.28 GHz on 25 well-localised FRB positions provided by ASKAP and MeerTRAP. We detect 14 radio sources and provide flux upper limits for 12 non-detections (both these numbers include a source that was detected during two epochs of observation, and not detected during one epoch, adding up to 26). One radio source shows variability as seen in flux variations over three epochs of observation. Archival optical data reveal excesses in the direction of 13 detected radio sources. Similarly for four sources in the X-ray band, with one possibly being a high-energy signature of a radio galaxy core. Since we cannot definitively classify our detected radio sources as PRSs, future high-resolution observations with e-MERLIN will be required to resolve the radio emission and pronounce on the presence of compact PRSs associated with the 14 detected sources presented here.
#### Twisted Pseudodisk and Asymmetric Mass Accretion on the Circumstellar Disk

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.07741

 - **Abstract**
 We model gas inflow patterns onto circumstellar disks and the evolution of the pseudodisk using three-dimensional resistive MHD simulations. Starting from a prestellar core without turbulence and with a misalignment between the initial magnetic field and rotation axis, the simulations are performed for $\sim10^5$ yr after protostar formation. After disk formation, the magnetic field around the disk becomes significantly distorted due to the disk rotational motion. Consequently, the structure of the pseudodisk also evolves into a complex morphology. As a result, both accretion onto the disk and outflow become asymmetric and anisotropic. Accretion to the disk occurs primarily through narrow-channel flows or streams. The time evolution of the infalling envelope leads to non-steady accretion onto the disk, which in turn causes variability in the mass accretion onto the central protostar. This study demonstrates that complex infalling envelope structures and channelized accretion flows onto the disk naturally arise even without assuming turbulence or external asymmetric inflows.
#### A Minimal Interpretation of the Galactic Cosmic-Ray Spectrum from GeV to PeV Energies

 - **Abstract**
 High-precision measurements of the cosmic-ray (CR) proton spectrum have revealed significant deviations from a simple power-law behaviour. These deviations are characterised by three prominent features: (i) a progressive spectral hardening above approximately 200 GeV, (ii) an excess between 10 and 30 TeV (the ``multi-TeV bump''), followed by a sharp turnover around 100 TeV, and (iii) a pronounced structure between 0.1 and 10 PeV (the ``PeV bump''). We propose a minimal two cosmic-ray population framework that consistently accounts for the observed CR proton spectrum across six decades in energy, from GeV to PeV. In this scenario, the spectral complexity arises naturally from a transition between two Galactic CR proton populations in the 10-100 TeV energy range. The low-energy population exhibits a sharp cutoff at tens of TeV, while a second, higher-energy population emerges and dominates above 100 TeV, terminating with a smooth exponential cutoff at approximately 6.5 PeV. This framework reproduces all observed spectral features without invoking contributions from nearby sources or requiring non-standard assumptions about particle acceleration or propagation. Recent gamma-ray observations of supernova remnants, star-forming regions, and microquasars provide plausible astrophysical candidates for the origin of the two CR components.

 - **Abstract**
 We present Kosmulator, a modular and vectorised Python framework designed to accelerate the statistical testing of cosmological models. As the theoretical landscape expands beyond standard $\Lambda$CDM, implementing new expansion histories into traditional Einstein--Boltzmann solvers becomes a significant computational bottleneck. Kosmulator addresses this by leveraging array-native execution and efficient ensemble slice sampling (via Zeus) to perform rapid Bayesian inference. We validate the framework against the industry-standard Cobaya code using a combination of Type Ia Supernovae, Cosmic Chronometers, and Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) data. Our results demonstrate that Kosmulator reproduces Cobaya's posterior constraints to within $\leq0.3\sigma$ statistical agreement on $H_{0}$ and $\Omega_{m}$ and $<0.6\%$ precision on $\chi^{2}$, while achieving a $\sim 4.5\times$ reduction in wall-clock time on a single CPU core compared to a standard MPI-parallelised baseline. Furthermore, we showcase the framework's utility by constraining the implicit power-law $f(Q)$ "$f_1$CDM" model and demonstrating its automated model selection capabilities (AIC/BIC). Kosmulator is introduced as a "scientific sieve" for rapid hypothesis testing, allowing researchers to efficiently filter theoretical candidates before deploying high-precision resources.

 - **Abstract**
 The renewed interest in lunar exploration and the development of future lunar communication and navigation services highlight the need for a precise, stable, and interoperable geodetic and timing infrastructure on the Moon. NovaMoon, proposed as a scientific and navigation payload for ESA's Argonaut lander, is designed as a lunar-based local differential, geodetic, and timing station supporting both operational needs in the Moon's south polar region and a broad range of scientific investigations. The payload integrates a lunar laser retroreflector, a Very Long Baseline Interferometry transmitter, a receiver for navigation signals compatible with LunaNet standards, high-stability atomic clocks, and direct-to-Earth radio links -- making it the first lunar station to co-locate multiple ranging, tracking, and timing techniques. NovaMoon will enable sub-metre to decimetre positioning, provide local differential corrections for lunar users, and ensure an accurate and stable realisation of position and time. Preliminary simulation studies show that this multi-technique dataset improves the lunar reference frame, orientation and ephemerides, and estimates of interior parameters like tidal response and core properties. NovaMoon will also provide the first long-duration physical realisation of a lunar time reference. Beyond its primary goals, it supports improved cartography, precise surface geolocation, and higher-resolution topography, contributing to safer landings and operations. It also enables new tests of fundamental physics, including constraints on relativity and possible deviations from classical gravity.
#### Dynamics of Y Dwarf Atmospheres

 - **Abstract**
 The global circulation regime of the coolest brown dwarfs, the Y dwarfs, remains largely unexplored. We investigate the interplay between convection, rotation, and cloud thermal feedback using a selected sample of Y dwarf atmospheric models. We explore effective temperatures $400~\mathrm{K} \leq T_{\mathrm{eff}} \leq 600~\mathrm{K}$ and rotation periods $P_{\mathrm{rot}} = 2.5 \text{--} 20\ \mathrm{h}$, where salt and sulfide condensates are expected. We include $\mathrm{KCl,~Na_{2}S}$, and $\mathrm{MnS}$ clouds to assess their atmospheric impact and identify circulation regimes across parameter space. We run twelve general circulation models (GCMs) spanning this grid and develop additional physics modules for the THOR GCM to model brown dwarf atmospheres. The dynamical core is coupled to interior thermal perturbations near the radiative-convective boundary, a mixing-length convection scheme, gray two-stream radiative transfer with Rosseland-mean opacities, and simple cloud tracers including thermal feedback and scattering. All simulations exhibit a radiative-forcing-dominated regime with weak winds, minimal horizontal temperature contrasts, and no persistent jets. Convection controls vertical mixing and sets the extent of salt and sulfide cloud layers below the photosphere. Thermal structures equilibrate quickly and cloud radiative feedback remains insignificant, with limited variability. Within the gray radiative transfer framework adopted here, Y dwarf atmospheres in this parameter space are controlled by interior thermal radiation. Rotation sets modest variability, while clouds play a secondary role. Because our single-band approach does not capture spectral windows that could probe deeper cloud layers, our constraints on cloud radiative feedback are likely conservative, and we outline pathways toward more active regimes.
#### IceCube's Sensitivity Prospects to MeV-Scale Axion-Like Particles from Core-Collapse Supernovae

 - **Abstract**
 We present a novel framework to estimate the sensitivity and discovery potential of IceCube to axion-like particles (ALPs) produced in core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe), covering ALP masses from 1 MeV to several hundred MeV. A key feature of this work is the explicit handling of the final-state leptons produced in ALP interactions with $^{16}$O nuclei and protons, which can generate Cherenkov light detectable in IceCube. These processes are being fully integrated into a detector-level simulation chain, enabling realistic detector signal modeling beyond existing estimates. The framework enables sensitivity forecasts for both direct detection and constraints based on time delays relative to the neutrino burst, across a range of ALP emission models. This approach may also extend to other MeV-scale dark sector particles. Preliminary sensitivity estimates are in progress and will be presented.
#### An unusual pair of interstellar HI features and a related white dwarf star inside the HI cavity surrounding the Upper Sco-Cen OB2 Association

 - **Abstract**
 Two mysterious unresolved HI structures at velocities of +12 and -6 km/s were discovered in high resolution 21-cm survey data in the direction of a faint white dwarf star. Examination of the HI morphology in this area of sky shows that the star and HI features exists in a large cavity in interstellar HI surrounding the Upper Sco-Cen OB2 Association. The cavity may have been created by an ancient supernova. It is hypothesized that the pair of HI features and filamentary HI structure found in its immediate vicinity may be the remnants of a planetary nebula some 3 x 10^5 years old that have cooled to the point that the gas is neutral and emitting the 21-cm spectral line. This remnant has maintained the morphological characteristics of the original planetary nebula because it expanded into a volume of space relatively devoid of interstellar gas that would otherwise have absorbed any traces of the original nebula.

 - **Abstract**
 We present Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE) estimates of the physical properties and star formation efficiency (SFE) of molecular gas in the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ), using new $^{12}$CO $J=2\to1$ observations from the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope. Combined with CHIMPS2 $^{12}$CO and $^{13}$CO $J=3\to2$, and SEDIGISM $^{13}$CO $J=2\to1$ data, we estimate a median excitation temperature of $T_{\rm ex} = 11$K for $^{13}$CO throughout the CMZ, with peaks exceeding $120$K in the Sgr B1/B2 complex. Cooler gas dominates around Sgr A and nearby clouds. We derive a median H$_{2}$ column-density of $N(\mathrm{H}2) = 2 \times 10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$ and a total $^{13}$CO-traced gas mass of $M_{\rm gas} = 7 \times 10^6$ M$_\odot$, consistent with previous estimates when accounting for spatial coverage. The instantaneous SFE is assessed using Hi-GAL compact sources detected at 70-$\mu m$ and 160--500-$\mu m$. The 70-$\mu m$-bright SFE, tracing current star formation, is modest overall but elevated in Sgr B1/B2, the Arches cluster, and Sgr C. In contrast, the 160--500-$\mu m$ SFE, tracing cold pre-stellar gas, is more broadly enhanced, particularly in the dust ridge clouds and towards negative longitudes surrounding Sgr C. The contrasting distributions suggest an evolutionary gradient in SFE, consistent with a transition from dense, cold gas to embedded protostars. Our results imply that the CMZ may be enter a more active phase of star formation, with large reservoirs of gas primed for future activity.

 - **Abstract**
 LOFAR observations of diffuse interstellar polarization at meter wavelengths reveal intricate polarized intensity structures with an unexpected correlation with neutral HI filaments that could not be reproduced in simulations with low cold neutral medium (CNM) abundance. We investigate whether MHD simulations of thermally bi-stable neutral interstellar medium, with a range of CNM fraction, can reproduce the properties of the 3C196 field, the high Galactic latitude test field. Using 50 pc simulations with varying levels of turbulence and compressibility, we generated synthetic 21 cm and synchrotron observations, including instrumental noise and beam effects, for different line-of-sight orientations relative to the magnetic field. We developed MOOSE, a code to generate synthetic synchrotron polarization and Faraday tomography. We also developed a metric based on the HOG algorithm, to quantify the relative contribution of cold and warm neutral medium structures to the Faraday tomographic data. The synthetic observations show levels of polarization intensity and RM values comparable to the 3C196 field, indicating that thermal electrons associated with the neutral HI phase can account for a significant fraction of the synchrotron polarized emission at 100-200 MHz. The simulations consistently reveal a correlation between CNM and Faraday tomographic structures that depends on turbulence level, magnetic field orientation, and observational noise, but only weakly on CNM fraction. We found slightly weaker CNM-Synchrotron polarized emission correlation level than observed in the 3C196 field. These results suggest that low-frequency polarimetric observations provide a valuable probe of magnetic-field morphology in the multi-phase Solar-neighborhood ISM, while simultaneously underscoring the need for improved modeling of the turbulent, multi-phase, and partially ionized interstellar medium.

 - **Abstract**
 Given the wealth of data provided by Gaia and the upcoming PLATO mission, it is essential to improve stellar models to obtain accurate stellar ages. Our objective is to apply a mapping technique to estimate the age of a system and the initial chemical composition. We also evaluate the influence of observational uncertainties in mass and heavy-element mixtures on results. We applied an inverse calibration method to the evolution of a multiple stellar system, assuming that the stars share the same age and initial chemical composition. This approach determines age, the initial mass fractions of helium ($Y_{ini}$) and heavy elements ($Z_{ini}$), as well as the convective mixing-length parameters ($\alpha_A $ and $\alpha_B$). It uses the observed luminosities ($L_A$ and $L_B$), radii ($R_A$ and $R_B$), and surface chemical compositions ($Z/X_A$ and $Z/X_B$). We used the most recent observational data for $M$, $R$, $L$, and $[Fe/H]$ of $\alpha$ Centauri A and B as input data for our method. We compared two assumptions for the $Z/X$ ratio, following the results for the solar composition. For an assumed high solar $Z/X_\odot =0.0245$, we obtain an age of $7.8 \pm 0.6$ Ga, $Y_{ini} = 0.284 \pm 0.004$, and $Z_{ini} = 0.0335 \pm 0.0015$. For a low solar $Z/X_\odot = 0.0181$, the derived age is $8.7 \pm 0.6$ Ga, $Y_{ini} = 0.267 \pm 0.008$, and $Z_{ini} = 0.025 \pm 0.002$. Observational errors in the stellar masses of $\pm$0.002 lead to an age error of 0.6 Ga. Overshooting of $0.05-0.20H_p$ at the boundary of the convective core increases the age by $0.6-2.1$ Ga. Models with higher $Z/X$ and radiative cores, with ages of $7.2-7.8$ Ga, appear preferable and show better agreement with the observed asteroseismic frequencies.

 - **Abstract**
 Binaries in the cores of globular clusters are known to prevent the gravitational collapse of the cluster, and simulations predict that the core of NGC 6397 contains a large number of white dwarfs (WDs), of which many are expected to be part of a binary system. In this work, we report the discovery of a compact binary system consisting of two WDs in the centre of the Galactic globular cluster NGC 6397. The system, known in the literature as NF1, was observed as part of a MUSE radial-velocity survey aiming at characterizing the binary population in the centre of NGC 6397. The spectral analysis of NF1 provides an effective temperature of 16000 K and a surface gravity (log g) of 5.72 (cgs), which is consistent with an extremely low-mass He-core WD nature. This is further supported by the mass of 0.23 +/- 0.03 Msun obtained from fitting the star's spectral energy distribution using its HST magnitude in various filters. The system has a circular orbit with a period of 0.54 days. The radial velocities show a large semi-amplitude of 200 km/s, implying a minimum mass of 0.78 Msun for the invisible companion, which is likely another WD, or a neutron star if the inclination of the system is smaller than about 50 deg. Some significant residuals in radial velocity remain with our best orbital solution and we tested whether a model with a third body can explain these deviations. While this possibility seems promising, additional measurements are needed to confirm whether the star is actually part of a triple system.

 - **Abstract**
 PN K4-47 is a young planetary nebula that exhibits shock-excited bipolar lobes and a complex molecular environment, with the highest number of molecules detected within a planetary nebula. It has been questioned whether K4-47 is indeed a `typical' planetary nebula, or may be more exotic in nature. We examine this question using optical imaging and spectroscopy, and sub-millimetre and radio interferometry. Our observations spatially resolve the sub-millimetre environment of K4-47 for the first time. We find elongated CO (2-1) emission along a similar PA to the optical bipolar outflow. We derive a distance upper limit of 6 kpc to the source. The source hosts a fast ($\sim$350 km s$^{-1}$) bipolar optical outflow, and a slow (~50-60 km s$^{-1}$) molecular outflow along a similar PA. The outflow velocity indicates an age of 336 $\pm$ 119 yr. We also find that the excitation temperature and density of the atomic gas is~20 kK and 2800 cm$^{-3}$, respectively. The elemental and isotopic enrichment of K4-47 infers an AGB progenitor mass of 4-6 M$_{\odot}$, which corresponds to a white dwarf mass of ~1 M$_{\odot}$, following the initial-final mass relation for white dwarfs. We find that the core of K4-47 must contain 10$^{-2}$ M$_{\odot}$ of dust to explain the extinction, and that photoionisation alone cannot explain the excitation of the atomic gas. We instead require an additional heating mechanism, with shocks a likely scenario. It is likely that the progenitor star of K4-47 was a J-type carbon AGB star, which formed the molecular and dusty circumstellar environment. The bipolar outflow is later triggered, punching through the circumstellar environment, producing shocks, and shaping the environment into the elongated structure seen in the sub-millimetre. We therefore classify K4-47 as a genuine, if unusual, planetary nebula.

 - **Abstract**
 We explore, using a state-of-the-art simulation code in 3D and to late enough times to witness final observables, the dependence of core-collapse supernova explosions on the nuclear equation of state. Going beyond questions of explodability, we compare final explosion energies, nucleosynthetic yields, recoil kicks, and gravitational-wave and neutrino signatures using the SFHo and DD2 nuclear equations of state (EOS) for a 9-$M_{\odot}$/solar-metallicity progenitor star. The DD2 EOS is stiffer and has a lower effective nucleon mass. The result is a more extended protoneutron star (PNS) and lower central densities. As a consequence, the mean neutrino energies, final explosion energy, and recoil kick speed are lower. Moreover, the evolution of PNS convection differs between the two EOS models in significant ways. This translates in part into interestingly altered neutrino ``light" curves and noticeably altered gravitational-wave signal strengths and frequency characteristics that may be diagnostic. The faster exploding model (SFHo) yields slightly more neutron-rich ejecta and more species with atomic weights between 60 and 90 and a weak r-process. However, this is merely a preliminary study. The next step is a more comprehensive and multi-progenitor set of 3D supernova simulations for various EOSes to late times when the observables have asymptoted. Such a future investigation will have a direct bearing on the neutron star and black hole birth mass functions and the quest towards a fully quantitative theory of supernova observables.

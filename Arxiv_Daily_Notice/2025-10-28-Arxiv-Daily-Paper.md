#### Metallicity regulates planet formation across all masses

 - **Abstract**
 The role of stellar metallicity in shaping planetary systems is central to our understanding of planet formation. While the core accretion paradigm is widely accepted as the dominant mechanism for forming low- and intermediate-mass planets, the origin of the most massive planets remains debated, with gravitational instability often invoked to explain their existence. In this study, we analyze the dependence of planet formation on metallicity using the total heavy-element mass fraction (Z), which is a proxy for the composition of the protoplanetary disk inferred from stellar photospheres. We show that even the most massive planets form preferentially in metal-rich environments. Z correlates not only with the presence of planets, but also with planetary system multiplicity and total planetary mass. The most massive planets are found in the most metal-rich environments, and, in agreement with core-accretion theory, only the upper end of the planetary mass distribution shows a clear positive correlation with metallicity. These findings suggest that the chemical enrichment of protoplanetary disks plays a central role in shaping the full spectrum of planetary masses.
#### Definition of Exoplanets and Brown Dwarfs

 - **Abstract**
 This chapter reviews the definition of exoplanets and of brown dwarfs. Emphasis is given to the separation of these two populations. A traditional view is to declare « planet » objects with a mass < 13 M Jup and « brown dwarf » objects with a mass > 13 M Jup . By analogy with Solar System planets, a better definition is to call « planets » objects formed by accretion of dust and planetesimals in a disk. An by extension of the primitive introduction of the word « brown dwarf » for failed stars by Jill Tarter, this term must be reserved to objects formed by gravitational collapse in a molecular gas cloud. The two definitions do not coincide since a « brown dwarf » can have a mass down to about 6 Jupiter mass. And there is no physical reason to assert that a 20 Jupiter mass object has not been formed by accretion. From there, the difficulty is to decide if an object of say 20 Jupiter mass is formed by dust accretion or by gravitational collapse. A future observational test to solve this difficulty is presented.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent Gaia-based young stellar association surveys have revealed dozens of low-mass populations that have, until recently, been too small or sparse to detect. These populations represent a largely unstudied demographic with unknown origins, and their relative isolation may minimize gravitational disruptions that impact traceback, making them compelling targets for dynamical studies. In this paper, we survey 15 of these isolated young associations for the first time: Andromeda South (SCYA-97), Aquila East, Aries South (SCYA-104), Cassiopeia East (SCYA-43), Canis Major North, Leo Central (SCYA-2), Leo East (SCYA-3), Theia 72, Ophiuchus Southeast, Scutum North (SCYA-70), Taurus-Orion 1 (TOR1), Theia 78, Vulpecula East (UPK 88), SCYA-54, and SCYA-79. By combining Gaia astrometry and photometry with new ground-based spectroscopic measurements, we assess the membership of each population, search for substructure, analyze their demographics, and compute ages. We find that the smallest populations in our sample contain $<20$ $M_{\odot}$ of stellar mass, making them the smallest associations ever detected. Four host substantial substructure, including TOR1, where we discover TOR1B, a new 9 $M_{\odot}$ association with radial velocities inconsistent with an origin in the parent complex. Using PARSEC isochrones, we produce self-consistent ages for all populations supported by dynamical and lithium depletion ages, which range from 6.9 $\pm$ 0.5 Myr in TOR1 to 42.8 $\pm$ 2.4 in AndS. Our results provide the first detailed overview of the properties of these populations, characterizing a largely unknown category of young associations that may have an important role in tracing the processes that guide local star formation.

 - **Abstract**
 When a supernova remnant (SNR) interacts with the dense material of an interstellar cloud, its shock wave decelerates rapidly, and the post-shock temperature drops to levels that permit efficient cooling of the shocked plasma. At this stage, the shock enters the post-adiabatic phase of its evolution. During this phase, the internal structure of the SNR undergoes significant changes, particularly in the immediate post-shock region, at spatial scales relevant to cosmic ray acceleration. Once the shock enters the post-adiabatic regime, the efficiency of diffusive shock acceleration increases due to a higher plasma compression, to a change in the direction of the advection velocity, and to an increased rate of momentum gain. As a result, the momentum spectrum of relativistic particles hardens, deviating from a pure power law at high energies. Particles could reach higher maximum values compared to classical predictions. We highlight the dynamics of post-adiabatic flows in SNRs, study their impact on particle acceleration, and present supporting observational evidence in the radio band.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. It has recently been suggested that angular diameter distances derived from comparing the variability timescales of blazars to angular size measurements with very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) may provide an alternative method to study the cosmological evolution of the Universe. Once the intrinsic brightness temperature ($T_{\rm int}$) is known, the angular diameter distance may be found without knowledge of the relativistic Doppler factor, opening up the possibility of a single rung distance measurement method from low $(z_{\rm cos}\ll1)$ to high $(z_{\rm cos}>4)$ redshifts. Aims. We aim to verify whether the variability-based estimates of the intrinsic brightness temperature of multiple active galactic nuclei (AGNs) converges to a common value. We also investigate whether the intrinsic brightness temperature changes as a function of frequency. Methods. We estimated the $T_{\rm int}$ of AGNs based on the flux variability of the radio cores of their jets. We utilized radio core light curves and size measurements of 75 sources at 15 GHz and of 37 sources at 43 GHz. We also derived $T_{\rm int}$ from a population study of the brightness temperatures of VLBI cores using VLBI survey data of more than $100$ sources at 24, 43, and 86 GHz. Results. Radio core variability-based estimates of $T_{\rm int}$ constrain upper limits of $\log_{10}T_{\rm int}$ [K]$<11.56$ at 15~GHz and $\log_{10}T_{\rm int}$ [K]$<11.65$ at 43 GHz under a certain set of geometric assumptions. The population analysis suggests lower limits of $\log_{10}T_{\rm int}$ [K]$>9.7$, $9.1$, and $9.3$ respectively at 24, 43, and 86 GHz. Even with monthly observations, variability-based estimates of $T_{\rm int}$ appear to be cadence-limited. Conclusions. Methods used to constrain $T_{\rm int}$ are more uncertain than previously thought. However, with improved datasets, the estimates should converge.

 - **Abstract**
 Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) on the early Sun may have profoundly influenced the planetary atmospheres of early Solar System planets. Flaring young solar analogues serve as excellent proxies for probing the plasma environment of the young Sun, yet their CMEs remain poorly understood. Here we report the detection of multi-wavelength Doppler shifts in Far-Ultraviolet (FUV) and optical lines during a flare on the young solar analog EK Draconis. During and before a Carrington-class ($\sim$10$^{32}$ erg) flare, warm FUV lines ($\sim$10$^5$ K) exhibit blueshifted emission at 300-550 km s$^{-1}$, indicative of a warm eruption. 10 minutes later, the H$\alpha$ line shows slow (70 km s$^{-1}$), long-lasting ($\gtrsim$2 hrs) blueshifted absorptions, suggesting a cool ($\sim$10$^4$ K) filament eruption. This provides evidence of multi-temperature and multi-component nature of a stellar CME. If Carrington-class flares/CMEs occurred frequently on the young Sun, they may have cumulatively impacted the early Earth's magnetosphere and atmosphere.

 - **Abstract**
 We report results from a five-year (132-night) dedicated observational campaign targeting two nearby young solar-type stars, EK Draconis ($\sim$50-125 Myr age) and V889 Hercules ($\sim$30 Myr age), using the 3.8m Seimei Telescope and Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite. The aim is to observationally constrain statistical properties of flaring radiation/heating as well as coronal mass ejections (CMEs), through high time-cadence H$\alpha$ spectroscopy. We obtained an unprecedented sample of 15 H$\alpha$ superflares, including two blueshifted absorption, two blueshifted emission, one redshifted emission, and nine line broadening events. We obtain the following results: (1) Larger flares exhibit broader H$\alpha$ line widths, up to 14.1$_{\pm 2.4}$ Å, indicating higher chromospheric heating than solar flares. (2) The long-lasting redshifted event at $\sim$100 km s$^{-1}$ may indicate dense post-flare loops. (3) H$\alpha$ blueshifted absorptions/emissions provide evidence of massive filament/prominence eruptions, the core structures of CMEs. One newly identified event showed an unexpected rapid decrease in velocity. (4) The lower limit of the CME/eruption association rate with superflares is 27$_{-16}^{+25}$%, yielding occurrence rates of 0.21$_{\pm0.12}$ and $<$0.32$^{+0.46}_{-0.32}$ events per day for EK Draconis and V889 Hercules, respectively. (5) We derived the first direct estimate of the lower limit of the mass-loss rate driven by super-CMEs ($\gtrsim10^{33}$ erg) for EK Dra as $4 \times (10^{-13}$-$10^{-12})$ $M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, comparable to the stellar wind mass loss at a similar age. This study provides critical observational constraints on the radiation and plasma environment around young solar-type stars and the early Sun, which can drive planetary space weather and stellar mass/angular momentum loss.

 - **Abstract**
 Ultralight dark matter (ULDM) model is a leading dark matter candidate that arises naturally in extensions of the Standard Model. In the Galactic Center, ULDM manifests as dense hydrogen-like boson clouds or self-gravitating soliton cores. We present the first study of the gravitational effects of these ULDM structures on pulsar orbits around Sgr A*, using pulsar timing as a precision dynamical probe, based on a comprehensive and practical framework that includes various kinds of black hole and orbital parameters. Our analysis shows that long-term pulsar monitoring -- one of the key objectives of future SKA science -- could detect a boson cloud with a total mass as low as $O(M_\odot)$ for boson mass $m \sim 10^{-18}\,\mathrm{eV}$, and probe a wide range of soliton core masses in the lower-mass regime, assuming a conservative timing precision of $\sigma_{\mathrm{TOA}}=1\,\mathrm{ms}$.

 - **Abstract**
 Using a large observational sample from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, we investigate the spatial alignment between galaxy pairs and their local cosmic filaments. Focusing on pairs with stellar masses and separations comparable to the Milky Way-Andromeda (MW-M31) system, we measure the angle between the pair connecting line and the orientation of the host filament, determined using a filament catalog constructed via the Bisous model. Our analysis reveals a statistically significant tendency of galaxy pairs to align their connecting lines along their host filaments, manifesting as an overall $\sim$7\% excess of alignment angles smaller than the MW-M31 case compared to a random distribution. Crucially, the strength of this alignment exhibits a strong dependence on the distance to the filament spine. Pairs located within 0.2 Mpc from the filament spine show the strongest alignment, while those beyond 1 Mpc display no significant alignment. Furthermore, we identify a bimodal distribution of alignment angles near filament cores, suggesting distinct dynamical populations potentially associated with infall and interaction processes. Our results provide robust observational support for theoretical models in which anisotropic accretion and tidal forces within the cosmic web drive galaxy pair evolution. They also position the MW-M31 system as a representative filament-aligned pair, offering insights into Local Group assembly. This study demonstrates the cosmic web's critical role in dictating pair orientations and motivates future work with kinematic data to unravel galaxy-environment interplay.
#### Stellar Wind-Blown Bubbles as Environments for Late-Time Rebrightening of Gamma-Ray Burst Afterglows

 - **Abstract**
 We presented the multi-wavelength afterglow fitting results for three events that exhibit late afterglow re-brightening behavior: EP240414a ($z=0.402$), GRB 240529A ($z=2.695$), and GRB 240218A ($z=6.782$), which span a broad range of redshifts, from the local to the high-redshift universe. We prove that the peculiar afterglow light curves of three bursts can be well fitted by structured jets propagated in free-to-shocked stellar wind environment of stellar wind blown bubbles. This scenario offers a self-consistent explanation for the observed subclass of afterglows that exhibit rebrightening that characterized by steep rises and rapid decays. It also provides a unified solution for such events and offers pathways to study both the jet generation mechanism and the propagation process of jets through the envelope of progenitor. This study reveals that the structured jets produced by such events exhibit a narrow jet core and a steep angle-dependent energy decay index, suggesting highly magnetized jets. The derived transition radii from free stellar winds to shocked stellar winds for all three events are smaller than 0.5 pc, with statistical analysis of similar events indicating a median value of 0.1 pc, which conflicts with numerical simulation results. We anticipate that future observations by EP/SVOM missions will enhance the understanding of analogous events and further reveil information about progenitors and the circum-environments.

 - **Abstract**
 The Mittelman-di Cicco-Walker (MDW) H$\alpha$ Sky Survey is an autonomously-operated all-sky narrow-band (3nm) H$\alpha$ imaging survey. The survey was founded by amateur astronomers and the northern sky (Decl. $\geq$ 0$^\circ$) is presented here in its second stage of refinement for academic use. Each 3.6$\times$3.6 sq. deg MDW field has 12 20-minute individual exposures with a pixel scale of 3.6", a typical PSF of 6", and a stack point source depth of 16-17 magnitudes. The northern MDW Survey Data Release 1 (DR1) includes: calibrated and raw mean and individual images, star-removed mean fields, and point source catalogs for all images matched to Data Release 1 of the Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System (Pan-STARRS1) and the INT Galactic Plane Survey (IGAPS). Our initial study of H$\alpha$ filament widths finds a typical FWHM of 30-45" in the Lyra region. The matched catalogs (with a median match distance of ~0.5"), combined with our distinctive narrow-band photometry, are used to identify H$\alpha$ variable and excess sources. These initial studies highlight some of the many scientific uses of the MDW H$\alpha$ survey.
#### Morphological and Kinematical Diagnostic of FU Orionis-type Outburst Mechanisms

 - **Abstract**
 We investigated the possibility of determining the mechanism of the FU Orionis-type outburst based on molecular line observations of protoplanetary disks with synthetic observations of distinct numerical burst models. The morphology of the synthetic $\mathrm{C^{18}O}$ emission is sensitive to gas temperature and does not coincide with the actual gas disk structures, particularly in the magnetorotational instability (MRI) and clump-infall models, which exhibit peculiar temperature distributions. This highlights the need for careful interpretation of morphologies of line emission from disks under accretion outbursts. The synthetic $\mathrm{C^{18}O}$ emission of each model exhibits distinct kinematic features that can be used to distinguish outburst scenarios. In the MRI model, kinematic features of the gravitational instability (GI), which fuels MRI-driven accretion bursts, are small in both amplitude and spatial extent, resulting in no prominent local features in the residual velocity map at a typical distance for FU Orionis-type objects. In contrast, the clump-infall model shows a clear sign of gas expansion along a spiral, which is caused by exchange of angular momentum between an infalling clump and surrounding gas. The intruder model exhibits a highly asymmetric velocity structure with respect to the systemic velocity of the primary protostar in velocity channel maps. These distinct kinematic features may serve as promising diagnostics for distinguishing the physical mechanisms responsible for FU Orionis-type outbursts.
#### Coronal Mass Ejections Deflected by Newly Emerging Flux: A Combined Analytic and Numerical Study

 - **Abstract**
 Newly emerging flux (NEF) has been widely studied as a trigger of solar filament eruptions, but its influence on the subsequent dynamics remains poorly explored. Because NEF typically emerges adjacent to filaments, it imposes magnetic asymmetry that can drive non-radial eruptions and complicate space-weather forecasting. We bridge analytic catastrophe theory with 2D resistive MHD simulations: analytic solutions provide magnetic configurations containing a flux rope at the loss-of-equilibrium point, which are then used as initial conditions for simulations to examine the following dynamics. We find that NEF governs the kinematics of filament eruptions in two ways. First, by reshaping coronal stability, NEF can create or eliminate a higher equilibrium in corona, thereby producing failed eruptions or CMEs. In the transitional situation where a metastable equilibrium appears, the rising filament decelerates and stalls before re-accelerating into a CME, consistent with observed two-step eruptions. Second, by breaking symmetry, NEF deflects eruptions away from the radial direction: depending on its polarity, it acts as a repulsor or an attractor on eruptive filaments, and the deflection magnitude increases with the degree of asymmetry. Our theory yields two characteristic angles that predict the deflection directions of CMEs and failed eruptions, and simulations closely aligns with these predictors. These results highlight the NEF not only as a trigger but also as a key factor that governs both the acceleration and deflection of eruptions during their propagation in the low corona.
#### The Sun as an X-ray star V.: A new method to retrieve coronal filling factors

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Stellar coronae are unresolved in X-rays, so inferences about their structure rely on spectral analysis. The "Sun-as-an-X-ray-star" (SaXS) approach uses the Sun as a spatially resolved template to interpret stellar spectra, but previous SaXS implementations were indirect and computationally heavy. Aims. We present a new SaXS implementation that converts solar emission measure distributions (EMDs) of distinct coronal region types into XSPEC spectral components and test whether broad-band X-ray spectra alone can recover their filling factors. Methods. We built XSPEC multi-temperature spectral models for four solar region types (background/quiet corona, active regions, cores, and flares) by using EMDs derived from Yohkoh/SXT data and translating each EMD bin into an isothermal apec component. These models were fit (using PyXspec) to two one-hour DAXSS spectra representative of quiescent (2022-06-29) and flaring (2022-04-25) states. Best-fit normalizations were converted into projected areas and filling factors and compared with near-coincident Hinode/XRT full-disk images. Results. Using the Yohkoh/SXT EMDs, the quiescent Sun spectrum is dominated by active region emission (filling factor ~22%), with the background corona poorly constrained. The flaring Sun spectrum is best described by a combination of active regions, cores, and flares with filling factors of ~47.5%, ~4.1%, and ~0.062%, respectively. The dominant components match spatial features seen in Hinode/XRT images. Limitations include the DAXSS low-energy cutoff (~0.7 keV) and the small, non-uniform Yohkoh EMD sample. Conclusions. Our SaXS implementation enables direct retrieval of coronal filling factors from broad-band X-ray spectra and provides a physically motivated alternative to ad hoc few-temperature fits, suitable for stellar X-ray analyses.

 - **Abstract**
 Quantum chemistry provides accurate and reliable methods to investigate reaction pathways of reactive molecular systems relevant to the interstellar medium. However, the exhaustive exploration of a reactive network is often a daunting task, resulting in unexplored reactive channels that affect kinetic outcomes and branching ratios. Here, an automated workflow for exploring reactive potential energy surfaces (PESs) is employed for the first time to study the oxirane (C$_2$H$_4$O) plus methylidyne ($^.$CH) reaction. The ultimate goal is to comprehensively map its PES and, subsequently, derive rate constants for the most important reaction channels. In addition to its astrochemical relevance, this reaction has been considered because it is a challenging test case, its network being very extended, with 60 exothermic bimolecular products lying below the reactant's energy. Kinetic simulations indicate that the main product of the reaction is the HCO radical plus ethene (C$_2$H$_4$), while formation of s-trans-propenal (acrolein) and 2H-oxene is also possible, but to a lesser extent. Based on the present study and other references in the literature, we suggest that the slightly higher relative abundance of s-trans-propenal compared to methyl ketene in the interstellar medium is a gas-phase kinetic effect, s-trans-propenal being a more easily accessible product on the C$_3$H$_5$O$^.$ PES.

 - **Abstract**
 A major goal of computational astrophysics is to simulate the Milky Way Galaxy with sufficient resolution down to individual stars. However, the scaling fails due to some small-scale, short-timescale phenomena, such as supernova explosions. We have developed a novel integration scheme of $N$-body/hydrodynamics simulations working with machine learning. This approach bypasses the short timesteps caused by supernova explosions using a surrogate model, thereby improving scalability. With this method, we reached 300 billion particles using 148,900 nodes, equivalent to 7,147,200 CPU cores, breaking through the billion-particle barrier currently faced by state-of-the-art simulations. This resolution allows us to perform the first star-by-star galaxy simulation, which resolves individual stars in the Milky Way Galaxy. The performance scales over $10^4$ CPU cores, an upper limit in the current state-of-the-art simulations using both A64FX and X86-64 processors and NVIDIA CUDA GPUs.

 - **Abstract**
 The fourth part of the Alma Luminous Star catalogue (ALS IV) aims to create the most comprehensive sample of massive stars in the Magellanic Clouds (MCs). By combining Gaia DR3 with Simbad and complementing this information with other photometric and spectroscopic catalogues, we select the massive stars in this region. To achieve this, we apply filters in photometry, combining different bands, as well as in variability and spectral types from the literature. With this approach, we will obtain one of the most complete samples of massive stars in the MCs, which can be used both to study the Clouds and the Magellanic Bridge, as well as the massive stars they contain.

 - **Abstract**
 Evidence from seismic studies, mineral physics, thermal evolution models and geomagnetic observations is inconclusive about the presence of a stably stratified layer at the top of the Earth's fluid outer core. Such a convectively stable layer could have a strong influence on the internal fluid waves propagating underneath the core-mantle boundary (CMB) that are used to probe the outermost region of the core through the wave interaction with the geomagnetic field and the rotation of the mantle. Here, we numerically investigate the effect of a top stable layer on the outer core fluid waves by calculating the eigenmodes in a neutrally stratified sphere permeated by a magnetic field with and without a top stable layer. We use a numerical model, assuming a flow with an m-fold azimuthal symmetry, that allows for radial motions across the lower boundary of the stable layer and angular momentum exchanges across the CMB through viscous and electromagnetic coupling. On interannual time-scales, we find torsional Alfvén waves that are only marginally affected by weak to moderate stratification strength in the outer layer. At decadal time-scales similarly weak stable layers promote the appearance of waves that propagate primarily within the stable layer itself and resemble Magneto-Archimedes-Coriolis (MAC) waves, even though they interact with the adiabatic fluid core below. These waves can exert viscous and electromagnetic torques on the mantle that are several orders of magnitude larger than those in the neutrally stratified case.

 We present a comparative study of transformer-based architectures for solar flare forecasting using heterogeneous data modalities, including images, video sequences, and time-series observations. Our analysis evaluates three recent foundational models - SigLIP2 for image encoding, VideoMAE for spatio-temporal video representation, and Moirai2 for multivariate time-series forecasting - applied to publicly available datasets of solar magnetograms from the SDO/HMI mission and soft X-ray fluxes acquired by GOES satellites. All models are trained and validated under consistent data splits and evaluation criteria, with the goal of assessing the strengths and limitations of transformer backbones across spatial and temporal representations of solar activity. We investigate multiple loss formulations (weighted BCE, focal, and score-oriented) and training balance strategies to mitigate class imbalance typical of flare datasets. Results show that while both SigLIP2 and VideoMAE achieve typical performance on image and video data (True Skill Statistic TSS~0.60-0.65), the time-series model Moirai2 reaches superior forecasting skill (TSS~0.74) using irradiance-based temporal evolution alone. These findings highlight the potential of pretrained transformer architectures and cross-modal learning for advancing operational space weather forecasting, paving the way toward unified multimodal models that integrate visual and temporal information.

 - **Abstract**
 Multidimensional hydrodynamical simulations have transformed the study of stellar interiors over the past few decades. Most codes developed during that time use the anelastic approximation, which fixes the thermal structure of simulations and filters out sound waves. Many of them also use explicit time integration, which imposes severe constraints on the time step of the simulations. In this context, MUSIC is developed to overcome these limitations. Its main scientific objective is to improve the phenomenological approaches used in 1D stellar evolution codes to describe major hydrodynamical and MHD processes. Here, we review recent applications of the MUSIC code, that focus mainly on convection, convective boundary mixing and waves in stars that possess convective cores, shells and/or envelopes.

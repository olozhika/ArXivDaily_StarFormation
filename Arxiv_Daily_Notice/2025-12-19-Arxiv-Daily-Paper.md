#### Self-confinement of relativistic pair beams in magnetized interstellar plasmas: the case of pulsar X-ray filaments

 - **Abstract**
 The observation of filamentary X-ray structures near bow-shock pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe) -- such as the Guitar, Lighthouse, and PSR J2030$+$4415 nebulae -- and of slow-diffusion regions around pulsars like Geminga, Monogem, and PSR J0622$+$3749, challenges the standard picture of cosmic-ray transport in the interstellar medium, implying a diffusion coefficient two orders of magnitude smaller than the Galactic average. The suppressed diffusion can be attributed to self-generated magnetic turbulence, driven -- via the non-resonant streaming instability -- by electron--positron pairs escaping the PWNe. This instability requires a net current, yet the beam of escaping pairs is expected to be charge-neutral. We show that a charge-neutral pair beam propagating through an electron--proton plasma can spontaneously generate a net current. Using fully kinetic two- and three-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations with realistic mass ratio, we find that beam electrons get focused into self-generated magnetic filaments produced by the nonlinear evolution of the Weibel instability, while beam positrons remain unconfined. The resulting net (positron) current drives the non-resonant streaming instability, further amplifying the magnetic field. This mechanism provides a pathway for the onset of charge asymmetries in initially charge-neutral pair beams and for the growth of magnetic fluctuations that efficiently scatter the beam particles, with implications for the formation of X-ray filaments and, more broadly, for particle self-confinement in TeV halos around PWNe.

 - **Abstract**
 The nearby star Fomalhaut is orbited by a compact source, Fomalhaut b, which has previously been interpreted as either a dust-enshrouded exoplanet or a dust cloud generated by the collision of two planetesimals. Such collisions are rarely observed but their debris can appear in direct imaging. We report Hubble Space Telescope observations that show the appearance in 2023 of a second point source around Fomalhaut, resembling the appearance of Fomalhaut b twenty years earlier. We interpret this additional source as a dust cloud produced by a recent impact between two planetesimals. The positions and motion of two impact-generated dust clouds over twenty years provide constraints on the collisional dynamics in the debris belt.

 - **Abstract**
 In the standard Cold Dark Matter (CDM) scenario, the density profiles of dark matter haloes are well described by analytical models linking their concentration to halo mass. Alternative scenarios, such as warm dark matter (WDM) and self-interacting dark matter (SIDM), modify the inner structure of haloes and predict different profile shapes and central slopes. We employ the AIDA-TNG simulations to investigate how alternative dark matter physics and baryonic processes jointly shape the internal structure of haloes. Using dark-matter-only and full-physics runs, we measure the dark matter density profiles of haloes spanning six orders of magnitude in mass, from 10^9.5 Msun to 10^14.5 Msub, and characterise them with multiple analytical models. We provide the distribution of the best-fitting parameters, as well as the concentration-mass relation in WDM and SIDM. The Einasto profile well reproduces the inner flattening produced in WDM models, both in the collisionless and in the full-physics runs. In SIDM dark-matter-only runs, haloes are better described by explicitly cored profiles, with core sizes that depend on mass and on the self-interaction model. When baryons are included, the differences between CDM and SIDM decrease, and such large dark-matter cores no longer form because adiabatic contraction in the baryon-dominated region counteracts self-interactions. Nevertheless, the coupling between baryons and self-interactions induces a broader range of inner slopes, including cases that are steeper than CDM at Milky Way masses. Alternative dark matter physics thus leaves clear signatures in the inner halo structure, even if baryons significantly reshape these differences. Our results are useful for future studies that need to predict the properties of haloes in multiple dark matter models.

 - **Abstract**
 The Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) provides a key laboratory for exploring the diversity of star formation and interstellar chemistry under subsolar metallicity conditions. We present the results of a hot core survey toward 30 massive protostellar objects in the LMC using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) at 350 GHz. Continuum imaging reveals 36 compact sources in total, among which line analyses identify 9 hot cores and 1 hot-core candidate, including two newly identified sources. We detect CO, HCO+, H13CO+, HC15N, HC3N, SiO, SO, SO+, NS, SO2, 34SO2, 33SO2, CH3OH, 13CH3OH, HCOOH, HCOOCH3, CH3OCH3, C2H5OH, H2CCO (tentative), and hydrogen recombination lines from hot cores. CH3OCH3, a complex organic molecule larger than CH3OH, is detected for the first time in a hot core outside the LMC bar region. All hot cores show stronger emission in the high-excitation SO line compared to non-hot-core sources, suggesting that its strong detection will be useful for identifying hot-core candidates in the LMC. Chemical analysis reveals a spread of more than two orders of magnitude in CH3OH abundances, with some sources deficient in COMs. In contrast, SO2 is detected in all hot cores, and its abundance shows a good correlation with rotational temperature. The hot cores without CH3OH detections are all located outside the LMC bar region and are characterized by either high luminosity or active star formation in their surroundings. A combination of locally low metallicity, active star formation in the vicinity, and high protostellar luminosity may jointly trigger the COM-poor hot core chemistry observed in the LMC.
#### ASKAP discovery of a 30 kpc bipolar outflow from the edge-on disk of the nearby spiral galaxy ESO 130-G012

 - **Abstract**
 We present the discovery of a large-scale, limb-brightened outflow, extending at least 30 kpc above and below the star-forming disk of the edge-on galaxy ESO 130-G012 (D = 16.9 Mpc). Partially obscured by Galactic foreground stars and dust, this optically unremarkable, low-mass galaxy reveals one of the largest known hourglass-shaped outflows from the full extent of its bright stellar disk. The outflow was discovered in 944 MHz radio continuum images from the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) obtained as part of the "Evolutionary Map of the Universe" (EMU) project. Its height is at least 3x that of the stellar disk diameter (~10 kpc), while its shape and size most resemble the large biconical, edge-brightened FUV and X-ray outflows in the nearby starburst galaxy NGC 3079. The large-scale, hourglass-shaped outflow of ESO 130-G012 appears to be hollow and originates from the star-forming disk, expanding into the halo with speeds close to the escape velocity before likely returning to the disk. Given ESO 130-G012's modest star formation rate, the height of the outflow is surprising and unusual, likely made possible by the galaxy's relatively low gravitational potential. Follow-up observations are expected to detect hot gas inside the bipolar outflow cones and magnetic fields along the X-shaped outflow wings. Neutral gas may also be lifted above the inner disk by the outflow.
#### IPA. Accretion rate of a low-mass Class 0 protostar, measured via mid-infrared fluorescent OH emission

 - **Abstract**
 The earliest stages of star formation are highlighted by complex interactions between accretion, outflow, and radiative processes, which shape the chemical and physical environment of the emerging protostar. James Webb Space Telescope observations of the low-mass, low-luminosity Class 0 protostar IRAS 16253-2429 reveal a central compact source. This object exhibits a rich mid-infrared emission spectrum of OH pure rotational lines and $\rm CO_2$ ro-vibrational lines. Unusually for a young stellar object, it has no mid-infrared line emission from $\rm H_2O$ to match the other molecules. We demonstrate that the emitting OH molecules arise from UV photodissociation of $\rm H_2O$ in its second absorption band at $\lambda = 114-145$ nm, and that the OH emission is a fluorescent cascade starting with highest-excitation rotational states. This situation offers the opportunity of using the infrared OH spectrum to measure the UV flux from the central protostar. Thereby we determine the disk-star accretion rate to be $3 \times 10^{-10} \ M_\sun \ {\rm year^{-1}}$, and demonstrate that the system luminosity arises mostly from the protostar's photosphere rather than from accretion luminosity. The result is in accord with the measured outflow rate of IRAS 16253-2429 and lies within the outflow/accretion-flow rate trend often inferred for protostars; and with episodic accretion as the dominant mechanism by which this protostar has grown.
#### LSTM-MDNz: Estimating Quasar Photometric Redshifts with an LSTM-Augmented Mixture Density Network

 - **Abstract**
 Quasar photometric redshifts are essential for studying cosmology and large-scale structures. However, their complex spectral energy distributions cause significant redshift-color degeneracy, limiting the accuracy of traditional methods. To overcome this, we introduce LSTM-MDNz, a novel end-to-end deep learning model combining long short-term memory networks (LSTM) with mixture density networks (MDN). The model directly uses multi-band photometric fluxes and associated errors as wavelength-ordered sequential inputs, eliminating the need for manual feature engineering while enabling simultaneous point estimation and probability distribution function (PDF) prediction of quasar redshifts. We integrate data from four major sky surveys-SDSS, DESI-LS, WISE, and GALEX-to assemble a sample of over 550,000 spectroscopically confirmed quasars ($0 \leq z_{\mathrm{spec}} \leq 5$) across 14 ultraviolet to infrared bands for model training and testing. Experimental results show that using all 14 bands yields optimal performance, with a normalized median absolute deviation ($\sigma_{\mathrm{NMAD}}$) of 0.037 and an outlier rate ($f_{\mathrm{out}}$) of 3.5\% on the test set. These values represent reductions of 29\% and 56\%, respectively, compared to the commonly adopted SDSS+WISE band set. Probability integral transform ($\mathrm{PIT}$) and continuous ranked probability score ($\mathrm{CRPS}$) analyses confirm that the predicted PDFs align closely with the true redshift distribution. Band-ablation experiments further highlight the essential role of ultraviolet and infrared data in alleviating color degeneracy and reducing systematic bias. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of multi-band fusion in improving quasar photo-z accuracy and offers a ready-to-use estimation framework for future surveys like LSST, CSST, and Euclid.
#### Astrometric and Spectroscopic Analysis of IC 2714: An Open Cluster Hosting a Lithium-Rich Giant

 - **Abstract**
 Open clusters serve as laboratories to study and evaluate stellar evolution and Galactic chemical evolution models. Chemical peculiarities, such as lithium-rich giants, are rarely observed in these stellar systems. This work focuses on eight red giants (#005, #028, #034, #053, #087, #121, #126, and #190) previously reported as members of the Galactic cluster IC 2714. We conducted a detailed investigation using high-resolution spectroscopy, supplemented with data from the Gaia DR3 catalog. Besides deriving the cluster's fundamental parameters, we provide the most thorough chemical characterization of IC 2714 to date, reporting the abundance of 23 species, including light elements (Li, C, N, O), odd-Z elements (Na, Al), $\alpha$-elements (Si, Ca, Ti, Mg), iron-peak elements (Sc, Cr, Ni), $\textit{s}$-process-dominated elements (Y, Zr, Ba, La, Ce, Nd) and $\textit{r}$-process elements (Sm, Eu). We also present the carbon isotopic ratios $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C for the first time for seven stars. One particular star (#087) exhibits a high lithium abundance ($\log \varepsilon$(Li)$_{\rm NLTE}$ = $+$1.54 dex) and a slightly higher projected rotational velocity ($v \sin i$ = 6.7 km s$^{-1}$). Our results suggest that the analyzed stars are in the core-helium-burning phase of evolution, where the most lithium-rich giants are found. Combining astrometric probabilities and chemical abundances, we conclude that two giants (#028 and #034) might not be cluster members.

 - **Abstract**
 Produced by the interaction between the ``pulsar wind'' powered by the rotational energy of a neutron star and its surroundings, the study of pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe) provides vital insight into the physics of neutron star magnetospheres and ultra-relativistic outflows. Spatially-resolved studies of the continuum and polarized radio emission of these sources are vital for understanding the production of $e^\pm$ in the magnetospheres of neutron stars, the acceleration of these particles to $\gtrsim10^{15}~{\rm eV}$ energies, and the propagation of these particles within the PWN as well as the surrounding interstellar medium. The significant improvements in sensitivity, dynamic range, timing capabilities offered by the Square Kilometer Array have the potential to significantly improve our understanding of the origin of some of the highest energy particles produced in the Milky Way.
#### Discovery of a rapidly evolving global magnetic field in the M-dwarf YZ Cet and constraints on the magnetic field of its planet YZ Cet b

 - **Abstract**
 We present a spectropolarimetric study of the nearby M4.5V exoplanet host star YZ Cet, based on near-infrared observations obtained with the SpectroPolarimètre InfraRouge (SPIRou) at the Canada--France--Hawaii Telescope. We detect striking changes in the large-scale magnetic field strength and geometry over the course of just a few stellar rotations, a level of short-term global magnetic field evolution rarely reported in M dwarfs. We modeled the temporal variation of the longitudinal magnetic field using a Gaussian regression process, which allowed us to robustly determine the stellar rotation period and quantify the evolution timescale of the magnetic field. Independent Zeeman Doppler Imaging reconstructions of the two epochs confirm a significant reconfiguration of the star's global magnetic strength and topology. The detection of a weaker, complex, axisymmetric magnetic field (mean $|B| \sim 201$~G), which changes into a stronger, non-axisymmetric, dipole-dominated field (mean $|B| \sim 276$~G) over a few rotation cycles, is in contrast to results from similar fully convective M-dwarf stars. YZ Cet is known to exhibit polarized radio bursts potentially driven by auroral radio emission from star--planet interaction (SPI). By combining our magnetic maps with recent radio observations, we refine the constraints on the magnetic field strength of the innermost planet, YZ Cet b. These results underscore the importance of monitoring stellar magnetic variability to interpret multi-wavelength SPI signatures and to characterize the magnetospheres of potentially habitable exoplanets.

 - **Abstract**
 Thousands of X-ray sources have been detected in the Galactic center (GC), most believed to be cataclysmic variables (CVs). As a potential probe of the old stellar population, in particular CVs, the existence and detectability of novae in the GC remain elusive, due to the prohibitive extinction toward the GC and their relatively low occurrence rate. Nova remnants evolving in the characteristic hot ($T\sim{10^{6}~\rm K}$) and dense ($n_e\sim{10~\rm cm^{-3}}$) interstellar medium in the GC may shed light on recent novae and provide useful insight on the GC ecosystem. In this work, we perform hydrodynamical simulations of putative nova remnants in the GC environment and calculate their time-dependent multiwavelength emission to estimate the detectability. Among 79 models sampling the nova parameter space (primarily ejecta mass and velocity), 6, 44, and 51 modelled nova remnants are detectable at their X-ray, radio, and Paschen-$\alpha$ maximum, respectively, for existing {\it Chandra}, VLA, and HST observations of the GC. The predicted peak luminosities are $\sim10^{32}~\rm erg~s^{-1}$, $\sim10^{31}~\rm erg~s^{-1}$, and $\sim10^{36}~\rm erg~s^{-1}$ in these three bands and the detectable window ranges from weeks to notably hundred years. By specifying a CV population of the nuclear star cluster, we estimate the probability of detecting at least one remnant to be 20\%, 8\%, and 18\% in X-rays, radio, and Pa$\alpha$. The nova remnant would be best resolved in the X-ray band. Our study highlights the potential for detecting nova remnants through further observations, leveraging JWST and the potentially forthcoming AXIS and SKA.
#### A direction-dependent framework for visibility plane mosaicing and primary beam correction

 - **Abstract**
 With the increasing sensitivity of modern radio interferometers, it has become important to image objects larger than the field of view while optimising sensitivity and image fidelity. We present a coherent visibility plane direction-dependent imaging, calibration and mosaicing framework. Our simulations and application to real MeerKAT data show that this joint deconvolution and primary beam correction approach, coupled with direction-dependent calibration, allows for deeper mosaics with greater fidelity and increased accuracy of recovered flux densities and spectral indices, especially beyond the half-power beam width. Our best-case mosaic produces precise flux values within a 6% uncertainty and spectral indices within 20\% throughout the imaged area, and is fully complete out to twice the radii and half the flux density than the image plane equivalent. The application to archival wideband MeerKAT 1283 MHz data produces the deepest high-resolution image of the Shapley Supercluster Core, with a sensitivity of 3.6 $\mu$Jy/beam within the primary beam at a 7$^{\prime\prime}$ resolution, constituting a $\sim$ 50% increase in dynamic range over the image plane counterpart, and a fluxscale that is consistent within 10% across the entire field of view. The compute time for the direction-dependent visibility plane mosaic was comparable to the sum of the times needed to perform direction-dependent calibration on the individual pointings. Our results suggest that visibility plane mosaicing with its capability for deeper deconvolution could improve the efficiency of deep and wide surveys, particularly for on-the-fly mapping and studies of low surface brightness sources, and could form the basis of future calibration pipelines for SKA-scale instruments.

 - **Abstract**
 The post-merger phase of binary neutron star (BNS) mergers encodes valuable information about the equation of state (EOS) of supranuclear matter. Extracting this information from the analysis of the post-merger waveforms remains challenging due to the high-frequency limitations of current detectors. Future third-generation observatories, such as the Einstein Telescope (ET) and NEMO, will have the sensitivity required to resolve post-merger signals with high fidelity. In this work, we apply CLAWDIA, our recently developed sparse dictionary learning (SDL) framework, to classify different EOS models using only the post-merger gravitational-wave emission of simulated BNS mergers available in the CoRe database. Our dataset comprises five EOS models representative of a broad range of neutron star properties. The SDL framework is optimised under realistic detection conditions by injecting signals into simulated noise matching the sensitivity curves of ET and NEMO. Our results show that classification is primarily driven by the dominant post-merger frequency, $f_2$, which encodes EOS-dependent information. At a modest signal-to-noise ratio of 5, our method achieves $F_1$ scores of $0.76$ for ET and $0.70$ for NEMO, with performance improving for higher signal-to-noise ratios. The reliability and generalisation capabilities of the model are assessed with additional tests, including the classification of an EOS not included in the training dataset and the analysis of detector-specific biases.
#### How massive neutrinos reshape the cosmic web

 - **Abstract**
 We explore the effects of massive neutrinos on the cosmic web using the FLAMINGO simulations. We classify the cosmic web into voids, sheets, filaments, and clusters, and find that massive neutrinos affect the environment by decreasing the volume occupied by clusters and voids. We find that increasing the neutrino mass shifts the volume-weighted density distribution towards higher densities and leads to a more narrow density distribution, which we interpret as neutrinos delaying structure formation. We construct the minimum spanning tree (MST) graph from the subhaloes, adopting a number density chosen to match that expected for DESI-like observations. We show that most MST edges lie in filaments, approximately 70% throughout different simulations, which we link to its sensitivity to neutrino mass. We also link the MST's edge length signal at different scales to different cosmic web environments, with clusters dominating the signal at small scales, voids at longer scales, and filaments at intermediate scales. The strong correlation between MST edges and cosmic web environments reinforces the MST's potential to be used as a classifier for large-scale structure in galaxy surveys. We compare the effects of baryonic physics and massive neutrinos and find that each produces distinct signatures in MST edge lengths. This analysis is performed in 3D space, using the true positions of subhaloes and not accounting for redshift space distortions. Nevertheless, these results emphasise the MST's capability to go beyond two-point statistics, motivating future applications to real observational data.
#### Double shell structure in supernova 2024ggi

 - **Abstract**
 We built a simple toy model of a core-collapse supernova (CCSN) ejecta composed of two shells, an outer low-mass spherical shell and an inner elongated massive shell, and show that it can reproduce the evolution of the photospheric radius of SN 2024ggi, Rph(t). During the first week, the larger spherical shell, the S-shell, forms the photosphere. As the shell expands and becomes increasingly transparent, the photosphere moves inward along the mass coordinate, although it grows in size. When the photosphere reaches the long axis of the elongated inner shell, the E-shell begins to contribute to the photosphere, ultimately comprising the entire photosphere. The simple toy model explains the transition of Rph(t) from being concave (decreasing slope) to convex (increasing slope). A single-shell model predicts only concave behavior. The structure of a spherical shell with an inner elongated shell is motivated by the morphologies of several CCSN remnants whose structures have been attributed to multiple pairs of jets in the framework of the jittering jets explosion mechanism (JJEM). The deduced multiple-shell ejecta of SN 2024ggi in this study, and of SN 2023ixf in an earlier study, as well as studies of the polarization of SN 2024ggi, are better compatible with the JJEM than with the neutrino-driven mechanism. Our study supports the growing evidence that the JJEM is the primary explosion mechanism of CCSNe.
#### Observing spatial and temporal variations in the atmospheric chemistry of rocky exoplanets: prospects for mid-infrared spectroscopy

 - **Abstract**
 Future telescopes such as the Large Interferometer For Exoplanets (LIFE) will enable mid-infrared characterisation of the atmospheres of nearby rocky exoplanets. Whilst 4D spatial and temporal variations of Earth as an exoplanet are below spectroscopic detection limits, such variability is planet-specific. We investigate LIFE's ability to detect 4D variability in the atmospheres of tidally locked exoplanets. We create daily synthetic LIFE observations of Proxima Centauri b in a 1:1 and an eccentric 3:2 spin-orbit resonance (SOR), using LIFEsim on spectra from daily 3D climate-chemistry model output of an aquaplanet with Earth-like composition. Hemispheric distributions of temperature, clouds, and chemical species determine spectral signatures and variability with orbital phase angle. Such variability dictates the extent to which parameters can be reliably inferred from snapshot spectra at arbitrary viewing geometries. In the 1:1 SOR, MIR spectra vary significantly with viewing geometry and indirectly probe atmospheric circulation. Nightside temperature inversions generate O3, CO2, and H2O emission features, though these lie below LIFE's detection threshold, and instead O3 features disappear at certain phase angles. In contrast, the 3:2 SOR yields a more homogeneous atmosphere with weaker phase variability but enhanced bolometric flux due to eccentric heating. Phase-resolved LIFE observations confidently distinguish between the SORs and capture seasonal O3 variability for golden targets like Proxima Centauri b. In case of abiotic O2/O3 build-up, the O3 variability presents a potential false positive scenario. Hence, LIFE can disentangle different spin-orbit states and resolve 4D atmospheric variability, enabling daily characterisation of the 4D physical and chemical state of nearby terrestrial worlds. Importantly, this characterisation requires phase-resolved rather than snapshot spectra.

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar flares are an intense stellar activity that can significantly impact the atmospheric composition of the surrounding planets and even the possible existence of life. During such events, the radiative energy of the star is primarily concentrated in the optical and X-ray bands, with the X-ray flux potentially increasing by tens or even hundreds of times. Einstein Probe (EP) detected a new X-ray transient EP J2322.1-0301 on 27 September 2024. Its spatial localization shows a high positional coincidence with the nearby high proper motion K-type star PM J23221-0301. Follow-up X-ray observations confirmed the flux enhancement of the source, while optical spectroscopic monitoring revealed time-variable features, particularly the disappearance of the H-alpha emission line. This X-ray flare is consistent with a characteristic fast-rise-exponential-decay (FRED) light curve, with a rise timescale of 1.4 ks, a decay timescale of 5.7 ks, and a total duration of about 7.1 ks. The peak luminosity in the 0.5-4.0 keV energy band reached about 1.3 x 10^31 erg s^-1, with a total energy release of about 9.1 x 10^34 erg, consistent with the empirical energy correlations observed in magnetic-reconnection-driven stellar flares, as inferred from the multitemperature plasma structure and H-alpha-X-ray energy correlation. This discovery underscores EP's capability in understanding stellar magnetic activity via observing stellar transients.

 - **Abstract**
 The Serpens OB2 association (l ~ 18.5 deg, b ~ 1.9 deg, d = 1950 +/- 30 pc) is a large star-forming complex ~65 pc above the Galactic midplane, with a clumpy, elongated structure extending ~50 pc parallel to the plane. We analyse a sample of probable association members, including OB stars and low-to-intermediate-mass young stellar objects (YSOs) from the SPICY catalogue. While both populations are found throughout the association, the OB stars lie preferentially on the side nearest the Galactic plane, while the YSOs are generally younger and more strongly clustered around molecular-cloud clumps detected in 13CO MWISP data. Using Gaia DR3 proper motions to probe the association's internal kinematics, we find aligned stellar velocities on length scales <2 pc, two-point velocity statistics that show increasing velocity differences and predominantly divergent motions at larger separations, and distinct velocities for star clusters within the association. Finally, the association exhibits gradual, but statistically significant global expansion perpendicular to the Galactic plane, with a spatial gradient of 0.10 +/- 0.02 km/s/pc. The expansion of the H II region Sh 2-54, powered by the association's OB stars, may be accelerating the star-forming cloud away from the plane given the system's geometry, plausibly inducing the vertical stellar velocity gradient. The clumpy stellar distribution, correlated velocities on small scales, and increasingly divergent motions on larger scales are consistent with an initial velocity field inherited from a turbulent molecular cloud modified by stellar feedback. Ser OB2 demonstrates that the multi-scale expansion of an OB association can begin even while star formation is still ongoing throughout the complex.

 - **Abstract**
 The discovery of exoplanets in binary star systems-now numbering about 850 of the nearly 4,600 known exoplanet systems-raises questions about whether observational bias or stellar companions inhibit planet formation. While most studies on terrestrial planet formation assume planar configurations, wide binaries likely feature random inclinations, potentially disrupting planet-forming disks. This study explores the evolution of embryo-planetesimal disks in S-type motion in misaligned binary systems, focusing on the stage after the gas phase when terrestrial planet formation begins and gravitational interactions dominate. Using our GPU-accelerated N-body code GANBISS, we simulate disks with 2,000 planetesimals and 25 planetary embryos, studying the influence of the planetesimals on the evolution of the embryos and tracking their growth through collisions. After the simulations, we analyse collision outcomes with an analytical model. Moreover, for certain inclined binary configurations, we compare dynamically excited (perturbed by the secondary star) with cold disks in inclined configurations, as the distribution after the gas phase in misaligned binaries remains unclear. Our simulations reveal two key outcomes: (i) embryos migrate slightly inward in misaligned systems, and (ii) The initial large oscillations in embryos' inclinations and nodes around the respective values of the secondary star dampen over time. Collision analysis shows distinct differences: planar systems favour accretive collisions, while inclined configurations exhibit more destructive events. These findings underscore the sensitivity of planet formation dynamics to binary star alignment and initial disk conditions.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the JWST/NIRSpec G395H transmission spectrum of the young (10 - 20 Myr old) transiting planet V1298 Tau b (9.85+/-0.35 Re, Teq=670K). Combined HST and JWST observations reveal a haze free, H/He dominated atmosphere with a large scale height (~1500km), allowing detection of CO2 (35 sigma), H2O (30 sigma), CO (10 sigma), CH4 (6 sigma), SO2 (4 sigma) and OCS (3.5 sigma). Our observations probe several scale heights (~4.4 in the CO2 4.3 microns and ~3 in the 2.7 micron water band). The planet's mass, inferred from atmospheric scale height using free retrieval and grid modelling is 12+/-1 and 15+/-1.7Me respectively which is significantly lower than previous radial velocity estimates and confirm it as a 'gas-dwarf' sub-Neptune progenitor. We find an atmospheric super-solar metallicity (logZ=0.6^+0.4_-0.6 x solar) and a sub-solar C/O ratio (0.22^+0.06_-0.05). The atmospheric metallicity is low compared to matured sub-Neptunes by an order of magnitude. The CH4 abundance ([CH4]=-6.1^+0.2_-0.3) is ~7 sigma lower than equilibrium chemistry prediction. To adjust for the low methane abundance, the self-consistent grids favour a high internal temperature (~500K) and vertical mixing (Kzz ~10^7-10^8 cm2/s). These internal temperatures are inconsistent with predictions from evolutionary models, which expect ~100 - 200K at the current system age. We estimate a gas-to-core mass fraction between 0.1 - 8 %, with a core mass of 11 - 12 Me, consistent with in-situ gas dwarf formation. A deep atmospheric metallicity gradient may explain both the high internal temperature and low observable metallicity. Over time, mass loss from such an atmosphere could enhance its metallicity, potentially reconciling V1298 Tau b with mature sub-Neptunes.

 - **Abstract**
 The Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) on the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) enables the characterisation of young self-luminous gas giants at previously inaccessible wavelengths, revealing physical processes in gas, dust, and clouds. We characterise the young planetary system TWA 27 (2M1207) in the mid-infrared (MIR), studying the atmosphere and disk spectra of the M9 brown dwarf TWA 27A and its L6 planetary-mass companion TWA 27b. We obtained data with the MIRI Medium Resolution Spectrometer (MRS) from 4.9 to 20 um, and MIRI Imaging in the F1000W and F1500W filters. We applied high-contrast imaging methods to extract the companion's spectral energy distribution up to 15 um at 0.78 arcsec separation and a contrast of 60. Combining these with published JWST/NIRSpec spectra, we analysed the 1-20 um range using self-consistent atmospheric grids and 0D slab models for molecular disk emission. The atmosphere of TWA 27A is well fitted by a BT-SETTL model with Teff 2780 K, log g 4.3, plus a 740 K blackbody for the inner disk rim. The disk shows at least 11 organic molecules, with no water or silicate dust emission detected. The atmosphere of TWA 27b is matched by a Teff 1400 K low-gravity model with extinction, best fit by the ExoREM grid. MIRI spectra and photometry for TWA 27b reveal a silicate cloud absorption feature between 8-10 um and significant (>5 sigma) infrared excess at 15 um consistent with circumplanetary disk emission. These MIRI observations provide new insights into TWA 27, revealing diverse features to study the formation and evolution of circumplanetary disks and young dusty atmospheres.

 - **Abstract**
 We evaluate the feasibility of Bose-Einstein condensate stars (BECS) as models for the interior of neutron stars. BECS are compact objects composed of bosons, formed through the spin-parallel pairing of neutrons. Here, we utilize the astronomical data from GW170817, XMMU J173203.3-344518 (the lightest neutron star known), and a novel lower limit on neutron star core heat capacity to scrutinize the compatibility of BECS with these recent observations of neutron stars. Our specific focus is to constrain the values of the scattering length $a$, a parameter determining the strength of particle interactions in the model. Our analysis suggests that if the stars involved in GW170817 were BECSs, the scattering length of their constituent bosons should fall within the $4$ to $10$ fm range. Additionally, at a scattering length of $a\sim 3.1-4$ fm, stars with mass and radius characteristics akin to XMMU J173203.3-344518 are identified. Moreover, we find that the heat capacity depends of the mass and temperature of BECS, and surpasses the established lower bound for neutron star cores when $a>2-5$ fm. In summary, our results endorse BECS models with $a\sim 4$ fm, providing neutron star observables in robust agreement with diverse observations and contributing to the ongoing understanding of neutron star interiors.

 - **Abstract**
 The filamentary dark cloud complex in Norma reveals signs of active low-mass star formation including protostars, H-alpha emission line stars, Herbig Haro objects, and the eruptive FU Orionis-like star V346 Nor. We present results of the first pointed X-ray observations of the Norma dark cloud, focusing on the westernmost Sandqvist 187 region. Chandra detected 75 X-ray sources and a complementary XMM-Newton observation detected 92 sources within the Chandra field-of-view, of which 46 are cross-matched to Chandra, yielding 121 unique X-ray sources. We present a catalog of X-ray sources along with basic X-ray properties and candidate IR and optical counterparts. Existing near-IR photometry reveals several X-ray sources with color excesses as typical of young stars with disks. Gaia parallaxes single out foreground stars and X-ray sources with distances of 500 - 1000 pc that are probable cloud members. The known emission line stars Sz 136 and Sz 137 were detected but V346 Nor was not. Interestingly, the optical and IR counterparts of the brightest Chandra source are not known with certainty but the prime suspects are very faint. Thus, the nature of the object responsible for the bright X-ray emission remains speculative. The X-ray observations presented here will serve as a pathfinder for identifying and characterizing the young stellar population in the Norma dark cloud.
#### Little Red Dots As Late-stage Quasi-stars

 - **Abstract**
 We argue that the "Little Red Dots" (LRDs) discovered with the James Webb Space Telescope are quasi-stars in their late stages of evolution. Quasi-stars are hypothetical objects predicted to form following the core collapse of supermassive stars, and consist of black holes accreting from massive envelopes at a super-Eddington rate. We show that models of late-stage quasi-stars, with black hole masses exceeding $\sim 10\%$ of the total, predict thermal and radiative properties that are insensitive to both black hole and envelope mass, and spectrally resemble LRDs. Specifically, we show that they are likely to exhibit reddish colors, a strong Balmer break, and possess conditions favorable to the production of Balmer lines that are broadened by electron scattering. Their huge electron column densities suppress any X-rays. Late-stage quasi-stars, with black hole masses $\gtrsim 10^6 M_\odot$, should dominate the overall quasi-star population. Their short predicted lifetimes (tens of Myr), coupled with the high observed comoving density of LRDs, suggest that most or all supermassive black holes go through a quasi-star/LRD phase during their formation and growth.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the main-sequence binary (MSMS) Catalog derived from Gaia Data Release 3 BP/RP (XP) spectra. Leveraging the vast sample of low-resolution Gaia XP spectra, we develop a forward modeling approach that maps stellar mass and photometric metallicity to XP spectra using a neural network. Our methodology identifies binary systems through statistical comparison of single- and binary-star model fits, enabling detection of binaries with mass ratios between 0.4 and 1.0 and flux ratios larger than 0.1. From an initial sample of 35 million stars within 1 kpc, we identify 14 million binary candidates and define a high-confidence "golden sample" of 1 million binary systems. This large, homogeneous sample enables detailed statistical analysis of binary properties across diverse Galactic environments, providing new insights into binary star formation and evolution. In addition, the $\chi^2$ comparison allows us to distinguish stars with luminous companions from single stars or binaries with dark companions, such as white dwarfs, neutron stars and black hole candidates, improving our understanding of compact object populations.
#### Application of interpretable data-driven methods for the reconstruction of supernova neutrino energy spectra following fast neutrino flavor conversions

 - **Abstract**
 Neutrinos can experience fast flavor conversions (FFCs) in highly dense astrophysical environments, such as core-collapse supernovae and neutron star mergers, potentially affecting energy transport and other processes. The simulation of fast flavor conversions under realistic astrophysical conditions requires substantial computational resources and involves significant analytical challenges. While machine learning methods like Multilayer Perceptrons have been used to accurately predict the asymptotic outcomes of FFCs, their 'black-box' nature limits the extraction of direct physical insight. To address this limitation, we employ two distinct interpretable machine learning frameworks-Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) and Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy)-to derive physically insightful models from a FFC simulation dataset. Our analysis reveals a fundamental trade-off between predictive accuracy and model simplicity. The KANs demonstrates high fidelity in reconstructing post-conversion neutrino energy spectra, achieving accuracies of up to $90\%$. In contrast, SINDy uncovers a remarkably concise, low-rank set of governing equations, offering maximum interpretability but with lower predictive accuracy. Critically, by analyzing the interpretable model, we identify the number density of heavy-lepton neutrinos as the most dominant factor in the system's evolution. Ultimately, this work provides a methodological framework for interpretable machine learning that supports genuine data-driven physical discovery in astronomy and astrophysics, going beyond prediction alone.
#### Dynamical traction and black hole orbital migration

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the circumstances which allow a black hole to remain put at the galactic centre when the stellar core is anisotropic. We use N-body calculations to study the response of stellar orbit families embedded in a larger, isotropic isochrone (Hénon) background potential. When the BH orbits in an odd f[E,Lz] velocity distribution function, they transfer angular momentum to it. We call this dynamical traction: it takes place whenever the kinetic energy drawn from f[E,Lz] has an excess of streaming motion over its (isotropic) v-dispersion. For a dynamically cold disc, the outcome depends on both the orbit of the BH and that of a Jeans-unstable stellar sub-structures. When the stellar clumps have much binding energy, a BH may scatter off of them after they formed. In the process the BH may be dislodged from the centre and migrate outward due to dynamical traction. When the stellar clumps are less bound, they may still migrate to the centre where they either dissolve or merge with the BH. The final configuration is similar to a nuclear star cluster which may yet be moving at ~10 km/s wrt the barycentre. The angular momentum transferred to a BH by dynamical traction delays the migration to the galactic centre by several hundred million years. The efficiency of angular momentum transfer is a strong function of the fragmented (cold) state of the stellar space density. In a dynamically cold environment, a BH is removed from the central region through a two-stage orbital migration instability. A criterion against this instability is proposed in the form of a threshold in isotropic velocity dispersion compared to streaming motion. For a BH to settle at the heart of a galaxy on time-scales of ~ 300 Myr or less requires that a large fraction of Lz be dissipated, or, alternatively, that the BH grows in situ in an isotropic environment devoid of sub-structures.

 - **Abstract**
 The outer Galaxy presents a distinctive environment for investigating star formation. This study develops a novel approach to identify true cluster members based on unsupervised clustering using astrometry with significant uncertainties. As a proof of concept, we analyze three outer Galactic Young Stellar Object (YSO) clusters at different distances and densities within 65 < l < 265 degrees, each known to contain >100 members based on the Star Formation in Outer Galaxy catalog. The 618 YSO clusters in the SFOG dataset were based on 2-dimensional clustering. In this contribution, we apply the HDBSCAN* algorithm to the precise Gaia DR3 astrometry to assign YSO cluster membership. Monte Carlo simulation, coupled with HDBSCAN* (HDBSCAN-MC algorithm), addresses YSO astrometric uncertainties while 5-dimensional clustering. We introduce the Generation Of cLuster anD FIeld STar (GOLDFIST) simulation, to enable robust membership determination, performing an unsupervised clustering analysis in higher-dimensional feature space while accommodating measurement errors. In this study, we extended our approach to distant outer galaxy YSOs and clusters with larger astrometric uncertainties. The results include the discovery of new members in the previously identified clusters. We also analyze the known stars in the clusters and confirm their membership. The derived membership probabilities are included in the provided cluster catalogs. The more accurately predicted simulation distance estimates closely agree, within uncertainty limits, with the median distance estimates derived from Gaia data, and are compared with the kinematic distances from the WISE HII survey.

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmological N-body simulations are among the primary tools for studying structure formation in the Universe. Analyses of these simulations critically depend on accurately identifying and tracking dark matter subhalos over time. In recent years, several new algorithms have been developed to improve the accuracy and consistency of subhalo tracking in cold dark matter simulations. These algorithms should be revisited in the context of new physics beyond gravity, which can modify the evolution and final properties of subhalo populations. In this work, we apply the particle-tracking-based subhalo finder Symfind to velocity-dependent self-interacting dark matter simulations with large cross section amplitudes to assess the performance of particle-tracking methods beyond the CDM paradigm. We find that the core-particle-tracking technique, which is key to the success of these algorithms in CDM, does not always yield accurate results in SIDM. The interplay between dark matter self-interactions and tidal stripping can cause the diffusion of core particles to larger radii, leading particle-tracking-based algorithms to prematurely lose track of SIDM subhalos. For massive core-expansion subhalos and core-collapse subhalos that experience close or repeated pericentric passages, a significant fraction of core particles can be lost, and particle-tracking-based finders such as Symfind offer no clear advantage over traditional methods that rely on identifying phase-space overdensities. On the other hand, for subhalos with large pericentric distances or fewer, more distant passages, Symfind tends to outperform. These differences depend sensitively on the cross section amplitude and turnover velocity of the underlying SIDM model. We therefore recommend a hybrid approach that leverages the strengths of both techniques to produce complete and robust catalogs of core-expansion and core-collapse SIDM subhalos.
#### The Rosetta Stone Project. II. The correlation between SFE and L/M indicator for the evolutionary stages of star-forming clumps in post-processed RMHD simulations

 - **Abstract**
 Context. The evolution of massive star-forming clumps that are progenitors of high-mass young stellar objects are often classified based on a variety of observational indicators ranging from near-IR to radio wavelengths. Among them, the ratio between the bolometric luminosity and the mass of their envelope, $L/M$, has been observationally diagnosed as a good indicator for the evolutionary classification of parsec-scale star-forming clumps in the Galaxy. Aims. We have developed the Rosetta Stone project$\unicode{x2013}$an end-to-end framework designed to enable an accurate comparison between simulations and observations for investigating the formation and evolution of massive clumps. In this study, we calibrate the $L/M$ indicator in relation to the star formation efficiency (SFE) and the clump age, as derived from our suite of simulations. Methods. We perform multi-wavelength radiative transfer post-processing of RMHD simulations of the collapse of star-forming clumps fragmenting into protostars. We generate synthetic observations to obtain far-infrared emission from $70$ to $500\ \mu$m, as was done in the Hi-GAL survey and at $24\ \mu$m in the MIPSGAL survey, which are then used to build the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) and estimate the $L/M$ parameter. An additional $1.3$ mm wavelength in ALMA Band 6 has also been produced for the comparison with observational data. We have applied observational techniques, commonly employed by observers, to the synthetic data, in order to derive the corresponding physical parameters. Results. We find a correlation between $L/M$ and the SFE, with a power-law form $L/M\propto {\rm SFE}^{1.20^{+0.02}_{-0.03}}$. This correlation is independent of the mass of the clumps and the choice of initial conditions of the simulations in which they formed. (Abridged)

 - **Abstract**
 Analyses by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) collaboration suggest a significant deviation from the $\Lambda$CDM model when their baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements are combined with Planck cosmic microwave background (CMB) data and various Type Ia supernova (SNIa) samples. In this work, we systematically investigate the origin of the deviations from the $\Lambda$CDM reported in recent cosmological analyses by combining different CMB datasets, BAO measurements, and DESY5 SNIa samples within the $w_0w_a$CDM framework. We find that the DESY5 SNIa sample, particularly its low-redshift component (DES-lowz), the Planck CMB data, the lensing measurements of Planck and ACT-DR6, and the DESI-DR2 BAO measurements contribute most significantly to the observed tensions. In contrast, combinations involving DES-SN, WMAP, SPT, and ACT-DR6 remain consistent with $\Lambda$CDM within $\sim1\sigma$. Our results highlight the critical impact of SNIa systematics, CMB data, and the choice of BAO dataset on constraints of dynamical dark energy models. These findings underscore the importance of improved calibration, homogeneity, and cross-validation of observational datasets to robustly assess potential deviations from the standard cosmological model.

 - **Abstract**
 The role of magnetic fields in the formation of dense filamentary structures in molecular clouds is critical for understanding the star formation process. The Snake filament in or close to the Pipe Nebula s neighboring, a prominent example of such structures, offers an ideal environment to study the interplay between magnetic fields and gas dynamics in the early stages of star formation. This study aims to investigate how magnetic fields influence the structure and dynamics of the Snake filament, using both polarization data and molecular line observations. Our goal is to understand the role of magnetic fields in shaping the filamentary structure and explore the kinematics within the filament. We conducted polarization observations in the optical and near-infrared bands using the 1.6 m and 60 cm telescopes at the Observatorio do Pico dos Dias/Laboratorio Nacional de Astrof\isica (OPD/LNA). Molecular line observations of the C18O and 13CO lines were obtained using the IRAM 30m telescope. We analyzed the data to characterize polarization and gas properties within the filament, with a focus on understanding the magnetic field orientation and its relationship with the filament s structure. Our findings reveal that the polarization vectors align with the filament s spine, indicating a magnetic field structure that is predominantly parallel to the filament at lower-density regions. A velocity gradient along the filament is observed in both C18O and 13CO lines, with C18O tracing the denser regions of the gas. The polarization efficiency decreases with increasing visual extinction, consistent with reduced grain alignment in higher-density regions. The filament s mass-to-length ratio is below the critical value required for gravitational collapse, indicating stability.

 - **Abstract**
 Millisecond pulsars are known to show complex radio pulse profiles and polarisation position angle evolution with rotational phase. Small scale surface magnetic fields and multipolar components are believed to be responsible for this complexity due to the radiation mechanisms occurring close to the stellar surface but within the relatively small light-cylinder compared to the stellar radius. In this work, we use the latest NICER phase aligned thermal X-ray pulse profile of PSR~J0740+6620 combined with radio and $\gamma$-ray pulse profiles and radio polarisation to deduce the best magnetic field configuration that can simultaneously reproduce the light-curves in these respective bands. We assume a polar cap model for the radio emission and use the rotating vector model for the associated polarisation, a striped wind model for the $\gamma$-ray light-curves and rely on the NICER collaboration results for the hot spot geometry. We demonstrate that an almost centred dipole can account for the hot spot location with a magnetic obliquity of $\alpha \approx 51 °$ and a line of sight inclination angle of $\zeta \approx 82 °$. However, with this geometry, the hot spot areas are three times too large. We found a better solution consisting of two dipoles located just below the surface in approximately antipodal positions. Our double dipole model is able to reproduce all the salient radio and $\gamma$-ray characteristics of PSR~J0740+6620 including radio polarisation data. A double dipole solution is more flexible than an off-centred dipole because of two independent magnetic axes and could hint at a magnetic field mostly concentrated within the crust and not in the core.

 - **Abstract**
 Pulsars, the cosmic lighthouses, are strongly self-gravitating objects with core densities significantly exceeding nuclear density. Since the discovery of the Hulse--Taylor pulsar 50 years ago, binary pulsar studies have delivered numerous stringent tests of General Relativity (GR) in the strong-field regime as well as its radiative properties -- gravitational waves (GWs). These systems also enable high-precision neutron star mass measurements, placing tight constraints on the behaviour of matter at extreme densities. In addition, pulsars act as natural detectors for nanohertz GWs, primarily from supermassive black hole binaries, culminating in the first reported evidence of a stochastic GW background in 2023. In this article, I review key milestones in pulsar research and highlight some of contributions from my own work. After a brief overview of the gravity experiments in §1, I review the discovery of pulsars -- particularly those in binaries -- and their critical role in gravity experiments (§2) that laid the foundation for recent advances. In §3, I present the latest efforts on GR tests using the Double Pulsar and a pioneer technique to constrain the dense matter equation of state. §4 demonstrates the potential of binary pulsars on testing alternative theories to GR. Advances in nanohertz GW detection with pulsar timing arrays are discussed in §5. I outline some of the current challenges in §6 and conclude with final remarks in §7.

 - **Abstract**
 In the build-up of galactic discs gas infall is an important ingredient and it produces radial gas inflows as a physical consequence of angular momentum conservation, since the infalling gas on to the disc at a specific radius has lower angular momentum than the circular motions of the gas at the point of impact. NGC300 is a well studied isolated, bulge-less, and low-mass disc galaxy ideally suited for an investigation of galaxy evolution with radial gas inflows. To investigate the effects of radial gas inflows on the physical properties of NGC300, a chemical evolution model for NGC300 is constructed by assuming its disc builds up progressively by infalling of metall-free gas and outflowing of metal-enriched gas. Radial gas inflows are also considered in the model. Our model including the radial gas inflows and an inside-out disc formation scenario can simultaneously reproduce the present-day observed radial profiles of HI gas mass surface density, SFR surface density, sSFR, gas-phase and stellar metallicity. We find that, although the value of radial gas inflow velocity is as low as -0.1 km/s, the radial gas inflows steepen the present-day radial profiles of HI gas mass surface density, SFR surface density, and metallicity, but flatten the radial sSFR profile. Incorporating radial gas inflows significantly improves the agreement between our model predicted present-day sSFR profile and the observations of NGC300. It predicts a significant flattening of the metallicity gradient with cosmic time. We also find that the model predicted star formation has been more active recently, indicating that the radial gas inflows may be help to sustain star formation in local spirals, at least in NGC300.

 - **Abstract**
 The nuclear rates for reactions involving 12C and 16O are key to compute the energy release and nucleosynthesis of massive stars during their evolution. These rates shape the stellar structure and evolution, and impact the nature of the final compact remnant. We explore the impact of new nuclear reaction rates for 12C({\alpha},{\gamma})16O, 12C+12C, 12C+16O and 16O+16O reactions for massive stars. We aim to investigate how the structure and nucleosynthesis evolve and how these processes influence the stellar fate. We computed stellar models using the GENEC code, including updated rates for 12C({\alpha},{\gamma})16O and, for the three fusion reactions, new rates following a fusion suppression scenario and new theoretical rates obtained with TDHF calculations. The updated 12C({\alpha},{\gamma})16O rates mainly impact the chemical structure evolution changing the 12C/16O ratio with little effect on the CO core mass. This variation in the 12C/16O ratio is critical for predicting the stellar fate, which is very sensitive to 12C abundance. The combined new rates for 12C+12C and 16O+16O fusion reactions according to the HIN(RES) model lead to shorter C- and O-burning lifetimes, and shift the ignition conditions to higher temperatures and densities. Theoretical TDHF rates primarily affect C-burning, increasing its duration and lowering the ignition temperature. These changes alter the core chemical structure, the carbon shell size and duration, and hence the compactness. They also affect nucleosynthesis. This work shows that accurate reaction rates for key processes in massive star evolution drive significant changes in stellar burning lifetimes, chemical evolution, and stellar fate. In addition, discrepancies between experimental and theoretical rates introduce uncertainties in model predictions, influencing both the internal structure and the supernova ejecta composition.

 - **Abstract**
 As the two Voyager spacecraft traveled beyond the heliosphere, they encountered a magnetic field environment that had never been observed before. Studies have attempted to characterize this new regime by examining the magnetic field intermittency. This is typically done by fitting the optimal kappa distribution function and interpreting its so-called q-statistics to characterize the magnetic field increments. Using this approach, recent findings concluded that beyond a certain distance, the magnetic field increments in the very local interstellar medium (VLISM) follow Gaussian statistics, unlike those both inside the heliosphere and in the region just beyond the widely accepted heliopause location, raising questions about the heliopause identification. This study explores this issue in detail by (1) optimizing the derivation of the distribution function, (2) examining whether and how the results depend on increment windows and time periods, and (3) determining the statistical behavior of the examined time series. Using magnetic field measurements from Voyager 1, we present two independent techniques and introduce a statistical framework to systematically analyze the distributions of magnetic field increments. Contrary to previous findings, we find that magnetic field increments in the VLISM do not follow a Gaussian distribution (k to infinity) and instead are in the non-Gaussian range of kappa values (3-7, when analyzed on a 30-day statistical period). We further demonstrate how erroneous, statistically induced results can arise that mimic Gaussian-like results when mixing different structures in such analyses. Our results show that Voyager 1 still travels in the intermittent magnetic field environment of the VLISM.

 - **Abstract**
 Isotopic ratios have been used as chemical diagnostics to investigate the origin of the material in the Solar System. We have determined the HCN, HNC, and N2H+ isotopic ratios and the chemical age in a large sample of 23 starless cores located in different environments. This work uses IRAM 30m data to constrain the D/H ratio of HCN, HNC, and N2H+ as well as the 14N/15N ratio of HCN and HNC. The observed abundances have been modeled using the chemical code DNAUTILUS 2.0. Deuterated compounds are detected in all of our sample cores, with average DNC/HNC, DCN/HCN, and N2D+/N2H+ values of 0.054$\pm$0.019, 0.036$\pm$0.033, and 0.15$\pm$0.11, respectively. The deuterium fractions (Dfrac) show a weak correlation with temperature and a large scatter that reflects that other factors such as core evolution could also play a significant role. Our chemical model is able to reproduce all the observed values with 0.2-0.3 Myr in Taurus and 0.3-0.5 Myr in Perseus and Orion. The 14N/15N isotopic ratio is found to be different between HCN/HC15N (430$\pm$120) and HNC/H15NC (296$\pm$64). We find no correlation between these ratios and the deuterium fractions, but we report a weak correlation with temperature. The Dfrac of HCN, HNC, and N2H+ can be used as evolutionary tracers of starless cores as long as the physical parameters are well constrained. The HCN/HC15N and HNC/H15NC ratios are not correlated with Dfrac, suggesting that the detected variations are not correlated with the core evolutionary stage. The average value of the HCN/HC15N ratio in our sample is significantly higher than the values measured in protostars and protoplanetary disks, possibly indicating that nitrogen fractionation processes are taking place during the protostellar phase.

 - **Abstract**
 Predictions for the acoustic attenuation coefficient and phase speed as functions of frequency and altitude in Saturn's atmosphere are presented and discussed. The pressure range considered in the study is 1 mbar to 1 bar, in windless and cloudless conditions. The atmospheric composition is represented by the major constituents, namely hydrogen (with its two spin isomers, ortho-H$_2$ and para-H$_2$) and helium. The H$_2$ and He concentrations are assumed constant with respect to altitude; however, non-uniform ortho- and para-H$_2$ profiles are considered. The acoustic wavenumber is obtained by incorporating a viscous, thermal, and internal molecular relaxation effects in a linearized fluid dynamics model. The ambient inputs are vertical profiles of the specific heats, shear viscosity, and thermal conductivity coefficients of the three-component (oH$_2$, pH$_2$, He) mixture, extracted at each pressure-temperature pair.

 - **Abstract**
 Spiral galaxy disks are thought to exist in a quasi-stationary state, between fresh gas accretion from cosmic filaments and disk star formation, self-regulated through supernovae feedback. Our goal here is to quantify these processes and probe their efficiency. While star formation can be traced at 10 Myr time-scales through H$\alpha$ emission, the signature of OB stars, and at 100 Myr scale with UV emission, the gas surface density is traced by HI emission for the atomic phase. We choose to investigate feedback processes using fountain effects in M101, a nearby well-observed face-on galaxy. Face-on studies are very complementary to the more frequent edge-on observations of these fountains in the literature. We use high-resolution data from THINGS for the HI emission GALEX for UV, and SITELLE/SIGNALS IFU for the H$\alpha$ tracer. We have identified 20 new HI holes, in addition to the 52 holes found by Kamphuis in 1993. We study in more detail the nine holes satisfying strong criteria to be true fountain effects, compute their physical properties, and derive their energy balance. Only one small HI hole still contains H$\alpha$ and young stars inside, while the largest hole of 2.4 kpc and oldest age (94 Myr) is deprived of H$\alpha$ and UV. For face-on disks, the possibility to study simultaneously the HI shell morphology, the stellar association, and kinematic evidence is of primordial importance. In M101, we have quantified how stellar feedback is responsible for carving the observed cavities in the atomic gas disk, and how it can expel above the disk the neutral gas, which is then unavailable for star formation during up to 100 Myr.

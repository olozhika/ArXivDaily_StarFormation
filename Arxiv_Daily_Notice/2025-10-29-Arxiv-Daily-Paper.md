 - **Abstract**
 Most stars form in dense stellar environments, where frequent close encounters can strongly perturb and reshape the early architecture of planetary systems. The solar system, with its rich population of distant comets, provides a natural laboratory to study these processes. We perform detailed numerical simulations using the LonelyPlanets framework that combines NBODY6++GPU and REBOUND, to explore the evolution of debris disks around solar system analogues embedded in stellar clusters. Two initial configurations are considered, an $Extended$ and a $Compact$ model, each containing four giant planets and either an extended or compact debris disk. We find that compact disks primarily form Kuiper belt and scattered disk-like populations through planet-disk interactions, while extended disks are more strongly shaped by stellar encounters, producing Oort cloud-like structures and interstellar comets with ejection velocities of 1-3 km/s. Stellar perturbations are most effective for encounter inclinations between $0^{\circ}$ and $30^{\circ}$, giving rise to distinct dynamical populations, like Sednoids, and inner Oort cloud analogues, and a characteristic tail in semi-major axis-eccentricity space. In coplanar encounters, the disk remains largely flattened, whereas polar flybys redistribute angular momentum vertically, producing nearly isotropic outer populations that resemble an emerging Oort cloud. Our results suggest that cometary reservoirs and interstellar objects are natural byproducts of planet-disk interactions and stellar flybys in dense clusters, linking the architecture of outer planetary systems to their birth environments.

 - **Abstract**
 The evolution of gaseous planets is a complex process influenced by various physical parameters and processes. In this study, we present critical modifications to the Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA) code to enhance its applicability to giant planet modelling. We introduce an equation of state specifically tailored for materials at planetary conditions. The equation of state considers the thermodynamic properties of hydrogen-helium mixtures and heavy elements, improving the accuracy of internal structure calculations. We also present modifications to the radiative opacity to allow the modelling of grains, clouds and opacity windows. Furthermore, we refine the treatment of convective mixing processes in MESA to better replicate convective mixing with the presence of composition gradients. Finally, we add a treatment for helium rain and settling. These modifications aim to enhance the predictive capabilities of MESA for giant planet evolution and are publicly available. We hope that these improvements will lead to a deeper understanding of giant planet evolution in the solar system and beyond.

 - **Abstract**
 Distance-based methods involve the computation of distance values between features and are a well-established paradigm in machine learning. In anomaly detection, anomalies are identified by their large distance from normal data points. However, the performance of these methods often hinges on a single, user-selected distance metric (e.g., Euclidean), which may not be optimal for the complex, high-dimensional feature spaces common in astronomy. Here, we introduce a novel anomaly detection method, Distance Multi-Metric Anomaly Detection (DiMMAD), which uses an ensemble of distance metrics to find novelties. Using multiple distance metrics is effectively equivalent to using different geometries in the feature space. By using a robust ensemble of diverse distance metrics, we overcome the metric-selection problem, creating an anomaly score that is not reliant on any single definition of distance. We demonstrate this multi-metric approach as a tool for simple, interpretable scientific discovery on astronomical time series -- (1) with simulated data for the upcoming Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time, and (2) real data from the Zwicky Transient Facility. We find that DiMMAD excels at out-of-distribution anomaly detection -- anomalies in the data that might be new classes -- and beats other state-of-the-art methods in the goal of maximizing the diversity of new classes discovered. For rare in-distribution anomaly detection, DiMMAD performs similarly to other methods, but may allow for improved interpretability. All our code is open source: DiMMAD is implemented within DistClassiPy: this https URL, while all code to reproduce the results of this paper is available here: this https URL.

 - **Abstract**
 Self-gravitating galactic halos composed of self-interacting dark matter exhibit the formation of a highly dense core at the galactic center--a gravothermal collapse. Analytic models to describe this evolution have been developed and calibrated to numerical simulations initialized with isotropic particle velocity distributions, an assumption not necessarily warranted by the theory of halo formation. Here we study the dependence of the timescale for gravothermal collapse on the velocity distribution. To do so, we consider self-consistent initial conditions for halos with the same density distribution but with different velocity distributions. We consider models with constant anisotropy and with an anisotropy that increases with radius. The velocity distributions that we explore have collapse times that differ from that assuming isotropic distributions by more than a factor of two. We argue that these variations may depend on the global changes in velocity-dispersion profiles in these anisotropic models and not just on the degree of anisotropy.
#### Twinkle Twinkle Little Star, Roman Sees Where You Are: Predicting Exoplanet Transit Yields in the Rosette Nebula with the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope

 - **Abstract**
 Young stars host only a small fraction of the known exoplanet population because their photometric variability, magnetic activity, and frequent placement in dense, poorly-resolved regions hamper exoplanet detections. Yet, measuring planets at these ages is crucial since these phases are when dynamical processes that drive planetary migration are most active. We assess the expected yield of a hypothetical Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope transit survey of the Rosette Nebula, a $\sim10\,\mathrm{Myr}$ star-forming region with a dense and diverse stellar population. Using the Roman Exposure Time Calculator to quantify sensitivity to Rosette members, we establish detection thresholds for companions and evaluate yields via Monte Carlo injection-recovery simulations. We predict the detection of $33 \pm 9$ young transiting exoplanets orbiting stellar hosts in a month-long survey, and $29 \pm 8$ in a two-week survey. The extended baseline primarily improves sensitivity to longer-period planets orbiting FGK stars, while most M dwarf detections are well-sampled within two weeks. Irrespective of the temporal baseline, transit detections are dominated by of 1-2\,$R_\oplus$ super-Earths and sub-Neptunes with $P\lesssim8$\,days. Such a sample would substantially expand the census of only three detected planets younger than $20\,\mathrm{Myr}$, probing an age regime in which planetary radii remain inflated, the stability of close-in orbits is uncertain, and planetary migration may still be ongoing. This survey offers a path to constrain early planetary evolution and establish prime follow-up targets for the James Webb Space Telescope, Vera Rubin Observatory, and the Habitable Worlds Observatory.
#### Hydrodynamic Simulations of Tidal Disruption Encores

 - **Abstract**
 We present hydrodynamic simulations with the moving-mesh code AREPO of Tidal Disruption Encores (TDEEs) in nuclear star clusters (NSCs). TDEEs arise when a stellar-mass black hole (sBH) disrupts a star within the NSC, producing debris that is unbound from the sBH but remains gravitationally bound to the central massive black hole (MBH), leading to a delayed secondary flare. We find that the morphology and thermodynamics of the fallback material depend sensitively on the disruption geometry, MBH mass, and sBH-MBH separation. We identify two distinct morphological outcomes: ring encores, where debris circularize into a torus, and direct encores, where streams plunge toward the MBH, with encore luminosities peaking at times corresponding to the freefall timescale and one orbital period, respectively. Across all simulated cases, we find these events exhibit luminosities of $10^{40}-10^{42}$ erg/s with lightcurves characteristic of their morphology. Our work greatly improves the predictions of TDEE lightcurves and empowers observations to probe into NSC dynamics and sBH population while providing possible explanations for anomalous TDE-like flares.

 - **Abstract**
 On August 18, 2025, the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration reported gravitational waves from a sub-threshold binary neutron star merger. If astrophysical, this event would have a surprisingly low chirp mass, suggesting that at least one neutron star was below a solar mass. The Zwicky Transient Facility mapped the coarse localization and discovered a transient, ZTF25abjmnps (AT2025ulz), that was spatially and temporally coincident with the gravitational wave trigger. The first week of follow-up suggested properties reminiscent of a GW170817-like kilonova. Subsequent follow-up suggests properties most similar to a young, stripped-envelope, Type IIb supernova. Although we cannot statistically rule out chance coincidence, we undertake due diligence analysis to explore the possible association between ZTF25abjmnps and S250818k. Theoretical models have been proposed wherein sub-solar neutron star(s) may form (and subsequently merge) via accretion disk fragmentation or core fission inside a core-collapse supernova i.e. a ``superkilonova". Here, we qualitatively discuss our multi-wavelength dataset in the context of the superkilonova picture. Future higher significance gravitational wave detections of sub-solar neutron star mergers with extensive electromagnetic follow-up would conclusively resolve this tantalizing multi-messenger association.
#### Unlocking the radio-gamma spectrum of the pulsar wind nebula around PSR J1124-5916 in SNR G292.0+1.8

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first detection of GeV $\gamma$-ray emission potentially associated with the pulsar wind nebula (PWN) hosted by the young core-collapse supernova remnant G292.0+1.8, based on a detailed time-resolved analysis of \textit{Fermi}-LAT data. By isolating the unpulsed component from the dominant magnetospheric radiation of PSR~J1124$-$5916, we successfully disentangle a candidate nebular emission in the GeV range, characterise its morphology and extract its spectrum. This identification places G292.0+1.8 among the few systems in which the pulsar and PWN contributions have been spectrally resolved at high energies, offering new insight into their respective emission mechanisms. We characterise the $\gamma$-ray spectrum of the pulsar and model the broadband spectral energy distribution (SED) of the PWN using radio, X-ray, and GeV data. The emission is well described by a single electron population with two spectral breaks: one intrinsic to the injection spectrum and another produced by synchrotron cooling in a magnetic field of $\sim$15~$\mu$G. Notably, the inferred magnetic field and the low TeV flux of the nebula resemble those of 3C~58, suggesting that similar low-field environments can arise in young PWNe. The high-energy portion of the SED is now tightly constrained by our GeV detection and existing TeV upper limits. Compared to our model, earlier predictions tend to underpredict the $\gamma$-ray flux, while others that succeed in reproducing the GeV component often overpredict the TeV emission. This mismatch underscores the challenges in modelling particle acceleration and radiation processes in young PWNe and establishes G292.0+1.8 as a valuable benchmark for testing and refining such models.
#### Does Machine Learning Work? A Comparative Analysis of Strong Gravitational Lens Searches in the Dark Energy Survey

 - **Abstract**
 We present a systematic comparison of three independent machine learning (ML)-based searches for strong gravitational lenses applied to the Dark Energy Survey (Jacobs et al. 2019a,b; Rojas et al. 2022; Gonzalez et al. 2025). Each search employs a distinct ML architecture and training strategy, allowing us to evaluate their relative performance, completeness, and complementarity. Using a visually inspected sample of 1651 systems previously reported as lens candidates, we assess how each model scores these systems and quantify their agreement with expert classifications. The three models show progressive improvement in performance, with F1-scores of 0.31, 0.35, and 0.54 for Jacobs, Rojas, and Gonzalez, respectively. Their completeness for moderate- to high-confidence lens candidates follows a similar trend (31%, 52%, and 70%). When combined, the models recover 82% of all such systems, highlighting their strong complementarity. Additionally, we explore ensemble strategies: average, median, linear regression, decision trees, random forests, and an Independent Bayesian method. We find that all but averaging achieve higher maximum F1 scores than the best individual model, with some ensemble methods improving precision by up to a factor of six. These results demonstrate that combining multiple, diverse ML classifiers can substantially improve the completeness of lens samples while drastically reducing false positives, offering practical guidance for optimizing future ML-based strong lens searches in wide-field surveys.

 - **Abstract**
 A new chapter is opening in the theory of core-collapse supernovae and neutron star mergers as simulations of these events begin to incorporate fast flavor conversion (FFC) and other forms of neutrino flavor mixing. Using numerical experiments, we show that the approximations of FFC that have been implemented so far are limited by at least two of three factors: (1) approximating continuous evolution as a discrete sequence of instabilities, (2) using spatially homogeneous asymptotic states, and (3) assuming that FFC must be accompanied by instability. The factors we identify in this work will be important considerations as the research area progresses from initial exploratory studies to more quantitatively precise assessments.
#### Cosmological Evolution of Gamma Ray Bursts

 - **Abstract**
 Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs) are classified as long (LGRBs) and short (SGRBs) with collapsars and compact object mergers (neutron star (NS)-NS or NS-Black hole) as progenitors, respectively. The former are expected to follow the cosmic star formation rate (SFR), while the latter follows a delayed version of the SFR. However, this division has come under question in several ways, the most prominent being the observational evidence of a significant excess of LGRBs at low redhifts by several independent investigations, summarized in arXiv:2305.15081. This could indicate that the progenitors of low-redshift LGRBs, whose formation rates are delayed, (similar to that of SGRBs) are compact mergers rather than collapsars. Two recent observations of low-redshift LGRBs show associations with kilonovae, a clear feature of compact mergers. Most results showing this separation are based on analyses of small (less than 200) samples of LGRBs with measured redshifts. The aim of this paper is to use a larger sample of LGRBs. The number of LGRBs with measured redshifts has increased by more than a factor of 2 over the last decade. To this data set we add a sample of LGRBs whose redshifts are estimated using a machine learning (ML) method (arXiv:2410.13985). This, in addition to increasing the sample size, reduces the observational selection bias arising from the process of redshift measurement. To account for this bias, we use the non-parametric, non-binning Efron-Petrosian method to establish the degree of correlation between luminosity and redshift, the luminosity evolution, which then allows us to use the Lynden-Bell $C^-$ method to obtain a complete description of the luminosity function. We find similar low redshift excess for the larger sample with measured redshifts. Adding the sources with ML-estimated redshifts, which tend to have more sources in mid-range redshifts, the excess is reduced.

 - **Abstract**
 We propose to use the unprecedented polarization sensitivity of PRIMA's PRIMAger Polarization Imager and its high resolution in Band 1 (92 $\mu$m) to map magnetic fields across two contrasting molecular cloud environments: the well-studied Perseus cloud and the isolated Musca filament. This comparative study will leverage the existing VLA radio observations that provide line-of-sight magnetic field component of the Perseus cloud, along with upcoming POSSUM survey results for Musca, to construct the first detailed 3D magnetic field vector maps at sub-parsec resolution. Perseus, with its known formation history through interstellar structure (e.g., bubble) interactions, will reveal how magnetic fields evolve during active star formation phases, while Musca, an isolated filament with lower star-formation activity, will show magnetic field morphology in early evolutionary stages. With PRIMA's resolution of 0.01 pc for Perseus and $<0.01$ pc for Musca, we will resolve magnetic field structures at scales necessary for understanding cloud fragmentation and star formation efficiency, and the roles that magnetic fields play in these processes. Our survey will require approximately 1438 hours to cover 42 deg$^2$ of Perseus and 12 deg$^2$ of Musca. With this, we aim to provide the first comprehensive view of how environment and evolutionary state may influence magnetic field evolution in molecular clouds and how magnetic fields influence cloud formation, fragmentation, and star formation.
#### How External Medium outside Prestellar Cores Affects Protostellar Growth: Variations in Accretion Rate and Evolution of Disks and Outflows

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.24065

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate how the external medium surrounding prestellar cores affects the star formation process by conducting three-dimensional resistive magnetohydrodynamic simulations. The initial cores follow critical Bonnor-Ebert profiles and are embedded in environments with different ambient densities. The simulations follow the evolution at least until the envelope mass within a radius equal to twice the critical Bonnor-Ebert radius drops to 35% of the initial cloud mass. We reveal that in environments with higher external density, enhanced mass inflow from the envelope leads to Bondi-like accretion as the protostellar mass increases. The continued inflow substantially increases the final stellar mass, resulting in star formation efficiencies that appear to exceed unity in dense environments. The external medium also influences the evolution of circumstellar disks and protostellar outflows: with the high-density external medium, disks grow rapidly but their mass becomes smaller relative to the protostellar mass, and the outflow is sustained over a long duration. However, the ratio of angular momentum removed by outflows and magnetic braking to that introduced by inflowing gas decreases with increasing external density. These results suggest that the density of the external medium regulates not only protostellar mass growth but also the inflow-outflow balance and angular momentum transport in magnetized, rotating star-forming cores.
#### Decadal brightening in the northeastern non-thermal filament of Cassiopeia A

 - **Abstract**
 We present the decadal brightening of non-thermal emission flux in the northeastern filament of the young supernova remnant Cassiopeia A (Cas A), which highlights dynamic processes in the forward shock. This filament, characterized by the highest particle acceleration rate among Cas A's outer shells, offers an exceptional opportunity to investigate underlying astrophysical mechanisms. Since 2000, the non-thermal flux has increased by several tens of percent before plateauing, while the spectral shape has remained largely unchanged. Over the past two decades, the filament's morphology has evolved significantly, splitting into two distinct sections. Detailed analysis reveals contrasting behaviors: one section shows a flux increase followed by saturation, while the other maintains a steady flux. These differences likely arise from nonlinear effects, including magnetohydrodynamic interactions influenced by magnetic field orientation, interactions with surrounding material, and complex fluid dynamics associated with young supernova remnants. The localized evolution of this filament, captured with high spatial resolution, provides critical insights into the temporal dynamics of non-thermal particles and the generation of cosmic rays from asymmetric supernova explosions.

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar mass is a fundamental quantity that determines the properties and evolution of stars. However, estimating stellar masses in star-forming regions is challenging because young stars are obscured by dense gas and the regions are highly inhomogeneous, making spherical dynamical estimates unreliable. Supervised machine learning could link such complex structures to stellar mass, but it requires large, high-quality labeled datasets from high-resolution magneto-hydrodynamical (MHD) simulations, which are computationally expensive. We address this by pretraining a vision transformer on one million synthetic fractal images using the self-supervised framework DINOv2, and then applying the frozen model to limited high-resolution MHD simulations. Our results demonstrate that synthetic pretraining improves frozen-feature regression stellar mass predictions, with the pretrained model performing slightly better than a supervised model trained on the same limited simulations. Principal component analysis of the extracted features further reveals semantically meaningful structures, suggesting that the model enables unsupervised segmentation of star-forming regions without the need for labeled data or fine-tuning.
#### What is the nature of late infall streamers?

 - **Abstract**
 Growing observational evidence suggests that Class II protoplanetary disks may undergo substantial interactions with their environment in the form of late infall. This mass inflow predominantly manifests itself in the form of so-called streamers: filaments and arcs of gas connecting large-scale, extended gas structures to disk scales. Prevalent late infall has far-reaching consequences for planet formation theory, challenging the long-standing treatment of evolved disks in isolation. In this work, we investigate the emergence of late-infall streamers in different formation scenarios, their morphology and multiplicity, as well as their dependence on environmental conditions. We conduct this investigation by performing 3D hydrodynamical simulation using the grid-based code FARGO3D, which we post-process to obtain synthetic observations using the Monte Carlo radiative transfer code RADMC3D. We find that, while a late infall event in the form of a single encounter with a "cloudlet" of gas can produce a streamer via an interplay between the fall-back of bound material and shocks, such features dissipate quickly, on a timescale of ~10 kyr. Furthermore, we find that streamers can also form naturally in a turbulent, dense environment without the need for such encounters, which could act to reconcile short-lived streamers with ubiquitous detection of these structures. Here, we find multiple co-existing streamers for a disk velocity relative to the interstellar medium of $v_\mathrm{sys}=0.5~\mathrm{km}~\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ and a turbulent velocity dispersion of $\sigma_\mathrm{turb}=0.5~\mathrm{km}~\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. We find considerable dependence of the streamer morphology on the environment, which may act as a utility to constrain the physical conditions of the gas surrounding planet-forming disk, and therefore the conditions under which planets form.
#### Alpha Core-Beam Origin in Low-$β$ Solar Wind Plasma: Insights from Fully Kinetic Simulation

 - **Abstract**
 In-situ observations of the fast solar wind in the inner-heliosphere show that minor ions and ion sub-populations often exhibit distinct drift velocities. Both alpha particles and proton beams stream at speeds that rarely exceed the local Alfvén speed relative to the core protons, suggesting the presence of instabilities that constrain their maximum drift. We aim to propose a mechanism that generates an alpha-particle beam through non-linear Landau damping, primarily driven by the relative super-Alfvénic drift between protons and alpha particles. To investigate this process, we perform one-dimensional, fully kinetic particle-in-cell simulations of a non-equilibrium multi-species plasma, complemented by its linear theory to validate the model during the linear phase. Our results provide clear evidence that the system evolves by producing an alpha-particle beam, thereby suggesting a local mechanism for alpha-beam generation via non-linear Landau damping.
#### The Impact of Cosmic Ray Transport on the $γ$-Ray Luminosity of Diffuse Gas

 - **Abstract**
 Observations of $\gamma$-rays from diffuse gas provide the opportunity to study the distribution of high energy particles in different astrophysical environments. In the circumgalactic medium (CGM) and the intracluster medium (ICM), it is expected that relativistic cosmic rays collide with thermal particles and produce $\gamma$-rays through pion decay. The $\gamma$-ray luminosity of a plasma depends on where cosmic rays are: if they are in denser gas, they produce more $\gamma$-rays. In this work, we study how different cosmic-ray transport mechanisms impact the $\gamma$-ray luminosity of a turbulent, multiphase medium formed from an initially diffuse medium. Two quantities set the luminosity: the average cosmic-ray energy density and the correlation of cosmic-ray energy and gas density. Overall, cosmic rays must escape cold dense regions in order to produce less $\gamma$-ray emission and be consistent with observations. Our simulations with fast transport mechanisms (either diffusion or streaming) are degenerate: they each produce a lower $\gamma$-ray luminosity than slow transport simulations by two orders of magnitude. This result means that fast transport (particularly in dense clumps) is necessary for simulations to agree with the dearth of observations of $\gamma$-ray emission from diffuse gas like the CGM and ICM. We also show the significant difference in luminosity is the result of cosmic-ray reacceleration. This reacceleration is different from the turbulent reacceleration described by Ptuskin (1988). Instead, condensing, cold clouds drive a significant increase in the average cosmic-ray energy and, as a result, the $\gamma$-ray luminosity.

 - **Abstract**
 Highly-irradiated giant exoplanets known as "ultra-hot Jupiters" are anticipated to exhibit large variations of atmospheric temperature and chemistry as a function of longitude, latitude, and altitude. Previous observations have hinted at these variations, but the existing data have been fundamentally restricted to probing hemisphere-integrated spectra, thereby providing only coarse information on atmospheric gradients. Here we present a spectroscopic eclipse map of an extrasolar planet, resolving the atmosphere in multiple dimensions simultaneously. We analyze a secondary eclipse of the ultra-hot Jupiter WASP-18b observed with the NIRISS instrument on JWST. The mapping reveals weaker longitudinal temperature gradients than were predicted by theoretical models, indicating the importance of hydrogen dissociation and/or nightside clouds in shaping global thermal emission. Additionally, we identify two thermally distinct regions of the planet's atmosphere: a "hotspot" surrounding the substellar point and a "ring" near the dayside limbs. The hotspot region shows a strongly inverted thermal structure due to the presence of optical absorbers and a water abundance marginally lower than the hemispheric average, in accordance with theoretical predictions. The ring region shows colder temperatures and poorly constrained chemical abundances. Similar future analyses will reveal three-dimensional thermal, chemical, and dynamical properties of a broad range of exoplanet atmospheres.

 - **Abstract**
 We aim to study the atmospheric properties of the warm Neptune GJ 436 b by combining a set of five transit events observed with the CARMENES spectrograph with one transit from CRIRES$^+$ so as to provide the most constrained results possible at high resolution. We removed telluric and stellar signals from the data using SysRem and potential planetary signals were investigated using the cross-correlation technique. Following standard procedures for undetected species, we performed injection recovery tests and Bayesian retrievals to place constraints on the detectability of the main near-infrared absorbers. In addition, we simulated ELT/ANDES observations by computing end-to-end in silico datasets with EXoPLORE. No molecular signals were detected in the atmosphere of GJ 436 b, which is consistent with previous studies. Combined CARMENES-CRIRES$^+$ injection-recovery and Bayesian retrieval analyses show that the atmosphere is likely covered by high-altitude clouds ($\sim$ $1$ mbar) at low and intermediate metallicities or, alternatively, is very metal-rich ($\gtrsim$ $900\times$ solar), which would suppress spectral features without invoking clouds. Simulations of ELT/ANDES observations suggest a boost by nearly an order of magnitude to the upper limit in the photon-limited regime, reaching $0.1$ mbar at $10$-$300\times$ solar metallicities. The joint analysis of all useful transit observations from CARMENES and CRIRES$^+$ provides the most stringent constraints to date on the atmospheric properties of GJ 436 b. Complementary CCF-based and retrieval approaches consistently indicate that the atmosphere is either cloudy or highly metal enriched. Any weak near-infrared absorption lines, if present, are likely to be below current detection limits. However, according to our simulations, these features may be revealed with ELT/ANDES even in single-transit observations.

 - **Abstract**
 Using a high-resolution simulation of a dwarf galaxy, we quantify the energetic importance of magnetic fields within the different phases of its interstellar medium (ISM) on parsec scales. We show that, whilst overall the magnetic field is only energetically dominant for a small fraction of the ISM, it becomes important in the thermally unstable regime (45.2% of the mass is magnetically dominated), and in the majority of the cold neutral medium (66.1% of the mass). In the molecular gas, the magnetic field dominates more of the total mass budget (39.8%) than thermal energy, turbulent kinetic energy, or gas self-gravitating potential energy. However, much of this gas will be CO-dark. This suggests that magnetic forces are non-negligible during the formation of cold dense gas, which will slow its collapse and lead to an increase in the fraction of cold atomic, and molecular gas in the ISM. Consequently, star-forming clouds may be surrounded by a larger reservoir of cold gas than would otherwise be expected.
#### Fractal Aggregate Aerosols in the Virga Cloud Code II: Exploring the Effects of Key Cloud Parameters in Warm Neptune, Hot Jupiter and Brown Dwarf Atmospheres

 - **Abstract**
 Aerosols and clouds are expected to be ubiquitous in exoplanet and brown dwarf atmospheres, where they can have a significant impact on transmission and emission spectra. The cloud code Virga is capable of quickly modeling cloud particle sizes as a function of altitude, and has recently been updated to include functionality for aggregates (ranging from very fluffy chains to compact fractals). We analyze the effect that these aggregates have on transmission spectra for typical warm Neptune and hot Jupiter environments, as well as their effect on emission spectra for an L-type brown dwarf, over the wavelength range 0.3 - 15 um. We find significant, measurable differences in spectra when particle shape is changed (particularly the shortest wavelengths where particle morphology strongly affects the scattering slope). We provide some intuitive rules for how non-absorbing aggregates impact spectra: when particle sizes are small compared to the wavelength of light, the most elongated and chain-like particles have the highest opacities. When particles are large, the inverse is true (the most compact shapes have the highest opacities). We present an explanation for these effects in terms of the dynamics of how the particles form and move through the atmosphere, as well as in terms of fundamental optics theory. Given the significant impact that particle shape can have on spectra, we strongly encourage the community to include shape as a free parameter in future case studies, atmospheric models, and retrievals.

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmology from weak gravitational lensing has been limited by astrophysical uncertainties in baryonic feedback and intrinsic alignments. By calibrating these effects using external data, we recover non-linear information, achieving a 2% constraint on the clustering amplitude, $S_8$, resulting in a factor of two improvement on the $\Lambda$CDM constraints relative to the fiducial Dark Energy Survey Year 3 model. The posterior, $S_8=0.832^{+0.013}_{-0.017}$, shifts by $1.5\sigma$ to higher values, in closer agreement with the cosmic microwave background result for the standard six-parameter $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. Our approach uses a star-forming 'blue' galaxy sample with intrinsic alignment model parameters calibrated by direct spectroscopic measurements, together with a baryonic feedback model informed by observations of X-ray gas fractions and kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect profiles that span a wide range in halo mass and redshift. Our results provide a blueprint for next-generation surveys: leveraging galaxy properties to control intrinsic alignments and external gas probes to calibrate feedback, unlocking a substantial improvement in the precision of weak lensing surveys.
#### A distance measurement for blazar TXS 0506+056 using its radio variability and very long baseline images

 - **Abstract**
 We present the results of constraining the angular diameter distance to blazar TXS 0506+056. We used data obtained with the 15 GHz VLBA in MJD 54838-60262 and data from the 15 GHz OVRO 40 m single dish telescope in MJD 54474-59023. We used a variability timescale and a causality argument of a linear size to measure the angular diameter distance to the source. To constrain the Doppler factor, we applied the relation between the rest-frame brightness temperature of the emission region and the observed brightness temperature. To calculate the observed brightness temperature, the angular size and flux density variation of the emission region are required. The angular size of the emission region (i.e., the VLBA core) was obtained from a FWHM, which is a circular Gaussian model-fitting parameter that ranges from 0.048-0.228 mas, and its uncertainty is determined to be 1.8-13 %. Using the OVRO SD light curve, we obtained a variability timescale of $128.0_{-0.3}^{+0.2}$ days and a peak flux density of $1.750_{-0.104}^{+0.015}$ Jy for the largest flare that peaked on MJD $58921.7_{-5.5}^{+2.6}$. We assumed a disk brightness geometry, equipartition brightness temperature ($5\times10^{10}$ K), and perfect radius. Using the VLBA core sizes obtained near the flare peaks, we found consistent distance measurement results with the $\Lambda$CDM model within 1$\sigma$ uncertainties. We suggest that the best distance from the source is $941_{-64}^{+59}$ Mpc, which is comparable with the $\Lambda$CDM distance of $948.2\pm13.5$ Mpc. The distance measurement should indeed be taken at the peak of a flare. We found that the decomposed timescale allowed us to obtain consistent distances with the $\Lambda$CDM. We strongly suggest to decompose light curves when the variability timescales are to be obtained properly.
#### Characterizing the Low-Mass Pre-Main-Sequence Population in the Low-Metallicity Star-Forming Region Dolidze 25 Using VLT-MUSE

 - **Abstract**
 The metallicity of the star-forming environment is a fundamental parameter shaping the evolution of protoplanetary disks and the formation of planetary systems, yet its influence remains poorly constrained. We present a spectroscopic study of low-mass pre-main sequence (PMS) stars ($M < 1 \, M_\odot$) in the exceptionally metal-poor cluster Dolidze~25 ($Z \approx 0.2 \, Z_\odot$), using VLT/MUSE observations to probe accretion processes and disk evolution in a subsolar environment. We identify 132 cluster members using a combination of \textit{Gaia} astrometry and spectroscopic youth indicators, including lithium absorption and Balmer emission. The stellar parameters are derived using low-metallicity BT-Settl models yielding effective temperatures, extinctions, luminosities enabling robust estimates of stellar masses and ages. Mass accretion rates ($\dot{M}_\mathrm{acc}$) derived from H$\alpha$ emission span $10^{-10}$--$10^{-8} \, M_\odot\,\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ with a median value of \(8 \times 10^{-10}\,M_\odot\,\mathrm{yr}^{-1}\). These rates are comparable to those in solar-metallicity regions of similar age, such as Lupus and Orion, indicating minimal metallicity dependence in accretion processes. Our analysis shows that using solar-metallicity templates to fit low-metallicity stars leads to systematic overestimations of \(T_\mathrm{eff}\) (by approximately \(300\,\mathrm{K}\)) and \(A_V\) (by around \(0.5\,\mathrm{mag}\)), underscoring the importance of employing metallicity-matched models for reliable characterization in low-\(Z\) environments. We present flux-calibrated, extinction-corrected spectra of these metal-poor PMS stars as a valuable resource for future investigations of disk evolution in subsolar regimes.
#### ALMA-QUARKS: Few-Thousand-Year Hatching out of "Egg": The Supersonic Breakout of a Hypercompact H II Region from Its Parental Hot Core

 - **Abstract**
 The kinematic evolution of hypercompact H II (HC H II) regions around young high-mass stars remains poorly understood due to complex interactions with parental environs. We present ALMA QUARKS/ATOMS 1.3 mm/3 mm observations (the highest resolution $\sim0.01$ pc) of a deeply embedded HC H II region (diameter $\sim0.015$ pc, electron density $\sim2\times10^{5}$ cm$^{-3}$) exhibiting a striking $\gtrsim20$ km s$^{-1}$ global redshift seen in optically thin H30$\alpha$/H40$\alpha$ recombination lines relative to its parental hot molecular core within a hub-filament system. The 1.3 mm continuum data reveal a distinct 0.1-pc arc and a perpendicular 0.04-pc tail. We propose that this morphology arises from a dynamic champagne flow: the slow expansion of HC H II region into a pre-existing filament forms the arc and associated low-velocity (few km s$^{-1}$) SiO shocks. Meanwhile, in the opposite direction ionized gas escapes along a steep density gradient traced by the tail and high-velocity (20 km s$^{-1}$) SiO emission. We reject the bow shock scenario in which ionized gas co-moves with a runaway high-mass star because shocked gas in the arc aligns with the hub velocity, contradicting the bow shock prediction. Non-LTE radiative transfer modeling further rules out infall of ionized gas as the velocity shift origin. We conclude that this exceptional HC H II region is undergoing a few-thousand-year transition phase of "hatching out of the egg": the ionized gas of HC H II region has just broken out of its parental hot core and now is flowing outward supersonically. This work highlights how anisotropic density distributions induce supersonically anisotropic ionized flows that govern HC H II region evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 The core collapse of a massive star at the end of its life can give rise to one of the most powerful phenomena in the Universe. Because of violent mass motions that take place during the explosion, core-collapse supernovae have been considered a potential source of detectable gravitational waveforms for decades. However, their intrinsic stochasticity makes ineffective the use of modelled techniques such as matched filtering, forcing us to develop model independent technique to unveil their nature. In this work we present MUSE pipeline, which is based on a classification procedure of the time-frequency images using a Convolutional Neural Network. The network is trained on phenomenological waveforms that are built to mimic the main common features observed in numerical simulation. The method is finally tested on a representative 3D simulation catalog in the context of Einstein Telescope, a third generation GW telescope. Among the three detector geometries considered here, the 2L with a relative inclination of $45^\circ$ is the one achieving the best results, thus being able to detect a Kuroda2016-like waveform with an efficiency above $90\%$ at 50 kpc.
#### Probing TeV Afterglow Emission of GRB~221009A with Gaussian Structured jet in Wind-driven medium

 - **Abstract**
 Recent detections of very high energy (VHE; GeV-TeV) photons from gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglows, most notably the extreme event GRB 221009A, require refined models that include realistic jet structures and complex circumburst environments. The jet's angular structure is crucial for shaping afterglow emission. Our recent work demonstrates that Gaussian jets, with their smooth angular decline, naturally produce early bright peaks for on-axis observers and delayed, softer, dimmer peaks at higher inclinations. The gradual decline suppresses excessive lateral expansion, unlike the sharp edge in top-hat jets, making Gaussian jets a compelling alternative to both top-hat and other structured-jet models. Here we implement a Gaussian structured-jet model to explain TeV afterglows from adiabatic forward shocks propagating in a wind-driven medium. We show that the TeV peak time and flux depend sensitively on jet geometry, kinetic energy, wind density, and on microphysical parameter ratios that scale the SSC component. We identify the afterglow parameter space that is favourable for detecting sub-TeV photons with the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA), finding that only about ten per cent of simulated TeV events exceed CTA sensitivity in a wind medium. These detections arise from near core-aligned views, with high kinetic energy and wind density, moderate initial Lorentz factor and downstream magnetic field, and a relatively large fraction of energy in nonthermal electrons. Applying this model to GRB 221009A, we perform multi-band fits including wind-modified dynamics, Klein-Nishina effects, and EBL attenuation, and find that a mildly off-axis geometry reproduces the observed X-ray and GeV-TeV light curves.

 - **Abstract**
 During the evolution of stars on the asymptotic giant branch (AGB), thermal pulses lead to the formation of strongly stratified layers in the outer regions of the CO core, which might lead to inversions in the chemical gradient. Such inversions would produce instabilities beyond the ones predicted by the Schwarzschild criterion and the standard use of mixing length theory (MLT). We used a set of MLT equations that consider the impact of the background chemical gradients. This extension of MLT is referred to in this work as MLT$\sharp$, to make a distinction between both prescriptions. We applied MLT$\sharp$ in tandem with the more general Ledoux instability criterion. We computed the evolution in the AGB phase and compared the chemical profiles resulting from MLT, MLT$\sharp$ and the double diffusive GNA theory. We continued the evolution through a post-AGB thermal pulse and performed a pulsational analysis of the resultant GW Vir models to asses $g$-mode pulsation periods. Finally, we tested our results with pulsation properties of known GW Vir stars derived from recent observations. We find that the much simpler MLT$\sharp$ set of equations closely reproduces the results from the GNA theory. As such, MLT$\sharp$ offers a simple way to include chemically driven convection in stellar evolution computations. Stellar evolution simulations show that Rayleigh-Taylor and thermohaline instabilities can play an important role during the TP-AGB. We obtained significantly different chemical profiles using a standard MLT approach compared to those resulting from our MLT$\sharp$ and GNA computations. Our adiabatic pulsational analysis shows that these differences in the chemical stratification leave clear mode-trapping signatures in the pulsation spectrum of the GW Vir models.
#### Oxygen Isotope Constraints on the Importance of Photochemical Processing in Protoplanetary Disks

 - **Abstract**
 Observations have revealed evidence of photochemical processing in protoplanetary disks. This processing occurs in the photon dominated layer, the optically thin regions of the disk high above the disk midplane. It remains unclear, however, how much this photochemical processing impacts the compositions of the planets and their building blocks within the disk. Here we use the oxygen isotopic compositions of Solar System solids, which has been attributed to photochemistry in the solar nebula, to quantitatively evaluate whether this processing could have produced the conditions needed to provide the diversity of compositions seen in the Solar System. We do this by modeling the chemical evolution while fine dust grows into the building blocks of the planets. We find that the oxygen isotopic evolution cannot be attributed to processing in the solar nebula and must instead be inherited from the parent molecular cloud. Further, our results indicate that the observed photochemical processing in protoplanetary disks does not significantly impact the compositions of planets that form within.
#### The critical role of clumping in line-driven disc winds

 - **Abstract**
 Radiation pressure on spectral lines is a promising mechanism for powering disc winds from accreting white dwarfs (AWDs) and active galactic nuclei (AGN). However, in radiation-hydrodynamic simulations, overionization reduces line opacity and quenches the line force, which suppresses outflows. Here, we show that small-scale clumping can resolve this problem. Adopting the microclumping approximation, our new simulations demonstrate that even modest volume filling factors ($f_V \sim 0.1-0.01$) can dramatically increase the wind mass-loss rate by lowering its ionization state -- raising $\dot{M}_{\rm wind}$ and yielding $\dot{M}_{\rm wind}/\dot{M}_{\rm acc}\!\gtrsim\!10^{-4}$ for such modest filling factors. Clumpy wind models produce the UV resonance lines that are absent from smooth wind models. They can also reprocess a significant fraction of the disc luminosity and thus dramatically modify the broad-band optical/UV SED. Given that theory and observations indicate that disc winds are intrinsically inhomogeneous, clumping offers a physically motivated solution. Together, these results provide the first robust, self-consistent demonstration that clumping can reconcile line-driven wind theory with observations across AWDs and AGNs.
#### Dust destruction by the supernova remnant forward shock in a turbulent interstellar medium

 - **Abstract**
 Context. While supernova remnants (SNRs) are observed to produce up to 1 M$_\odot$ of dust, the amount of dust destroyed by the forward shock (FS) is poorly constrained, raising the question whether they are net dust producers or destroyers. Aims. We aim to estimate the dust destruction efficiency of SNR FSs in a realistically turbulent interstellar medium (ISM) during their most destructive phase, and assess dust shielding by high density filaments during this period. Methods. We run 3D turbulence simulations for different turbulent Mach numbers (0-3) and average ISM densities (1-100 cm$^{-3}$) to resemble observations of the turbulent ISM. We then set off a supernova to trace its 3D magnetohydrodynamical evolution for 10 kyr. Finally, we run post-processing simulations to study the dust transport and destruction by the SNR FS, considering gas and plasma drag, kinetic and thermal sputtering, and grain-grain collisions, and either silicate or carbonaceous dust. Results. The dust destruction rate of the FS strongly depends on the average ISM density and turbulence strength, varying between 27-92% (0.85-11.0 M$_\odot$) in the studied 10 kyr. Overall, dust is less efficiently destroyed in a low density medium (1 cm$^{-3}$, 27-57%) than in intermediate (10 cm$^{-3}$, 46-92%) and high densities (100 cm$^{-3}$, 73-87%). The FS destroys 8-34% less dust in high Mach turbulence compared to a homogeneous medium. Furthermore, carbonaceous grains are more robust (up to 21% more) than silicates. Conclusions. Filaments can partly shield dust from destruction in the first 10 kyr, however, always more than 0.85 M$_\odot$ of dust is destroyed, making most SNRs dust sinks under the conditions explored in this work. The destruction efficiency of the SNRs with less than 1 M$_\odot$ of destroyed dust has not yet plateaued so that they are most likely also net dust destroyers by the end of their lifetime.

 - **Abstract**
 The gravitational wave event GW231123 detected by the LIGO interferometers during their fourth observing run features two black holes with source-frame masses of $137^{+22}_{-17} M_\odot$ and $103^{+20}_{-52} M_\odot $ -- well within or above the pair-instability black hole mass gap predicted by standard stellar evolution theory. Both black holes are also inferred to be rapidly spinning ($\chi_1 \simeq 0.9$, $\chi_2 \simeq 0.8$). The primary object in GW231123 is the heaviest stellar mass black hole detected to date, which, together with its extreme rotation, raises questions about its astrophysical origin. Accounting for the unusually large spin of $\sim 0.9$ with hierarchical mergers requires some degree of fine tuning. We investigate whether such a massive, highly spinning object could plausibly form from the collapse of a single rotating massive star. We simulate stars with an initial core mass of $160 \rm M_\odot$ -- sufficient to produce BH masses at the upper edge of the 90% credible interval for $m_1$ in GW231123 -- across a range of rotation rates and $^{12}\mathrm{C}(\alpha,\gamma)^{16}\mathrm{O}$ reaction rates. We find that: (i) rotation shifts the pair-instability mass gap to higher masses, introducing a significant ingredient that correlates masses and spins in gravitational wave predictions; and (ii) highly spinning BHs with masses $\gtrsim 150 \rm M_\odot$ can form above the mass gap, implying that stellar evolution alone is sufficient to explain GW231123. Our results suggest that the primary object of GW231123 may be the first directly observed black hole that formed via direct core collapse following the photodisintegration instability.

 - **Abstract**
 We present polarization maps of dust emission at 340 GHz in the luminous high-mass protocluster, W3 IRS5, observed with the Submillimeter Array. The projected magnetic fields appear fairly organized with a pinched morphology in the northern part and a concave shape in the southern part. We fit the polarization maps with a two-component magnetic field model: an hourglass model centered at the continuum peak, SMM2, and an empirical sphere centered at the O-type star, IRS7. Using the Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi method, we calculate a projected field strength of $B_\mathrm{pos} = 1.4 \; \mathrm{mG}$. Along with the Zeeman measurement, a total magnetic field strength of $B_\mathrm{tot} = 1.6 \; \mathrm{mG}$ is obtained. We find that the gravitational energy is the most dominant, followed by magnetic energy, and then turbulent energy. Small values of the virial parameter, $\alpha_\mathrm{vir} = 0.8$, and the ratio of timescales, $t_\mathrm{ff}/t_\mathrm{corss} = 0.6$, suggest an ongoing collapse. We also show collimated molecular outflows in the $\mathrm{CO \; (3-2)}$ and $\mathrm{SiO \; (8-7)}$ transitions. The morphology of magnetic fields and the surrounding \HII regions put forward a scenario for W3 IRS5. A gravitationally unstable dense core formed within a neutral gas ridge plowed by the expansions of W3 A and W3 B. The core began to contract, causing gravity to pull the magnetic field lines inward, which resulted in a pinched field morphology. Subsequent expansion of W3 F, ionized by IRS7, perturbed the magnetic field, creating concave patterns. The dynamical interactions among protostars led to misalignment of their outflows.

 - **Abstract**
 A few years ago, we investigated MYSO G29.862-0.0044 (YSO-G29), an intriguing star-forming region at a distance of 6.2 kpc. Although the typical disc-jet scenario was proposed to explain the observations, it remained far from conclusive. YSO-G29 was analysed using new observations at near-IR from Gemini-NIFS, at radio continuum (10 GHz) from Jansky Very Large Array (JVLA), and new continuum (1.3 mm) and molecular line data from the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA). The near-IR observations allowed us to detect emission of H2 1-0 S(1) and Br-gamma lines in YSO-G29, which are compatible with excitation and ionization from UV radiation propagating in a highly perturbed ambient. In addition, some evidence of H2 excitation by collisions were found. The ALMA data show the presence of a conspicuous and collimated molecular outflow propagating southwards, while to the north, an extended molecular feature perfectly surrounded by the Ks near-IR emission appears. The continuum emission at 1.3 mm allowed us to better resolve the molecular cores, one of which stands out due to its high temperatures and rich chemical composition. From the JVLA observations, we discovered a compact radio continuum source, a likely compact Hii region or an ionised jet of a massive protostar, located at ~0.7 arcsec (~ 0.02 pc) from the main millimetre core. In this way, we propose a YSO wide binary system. {We can explain the nature of the intriguing near-IR features previously observed: cone-like structures produced by jets/winds of one of the components of the binary system that cleared out the surroundings were disrupted by a molecular outflow probably from the other component. These results complete the picture of what is happening in YSO-G29, and reveal a phenomenon that should be considered when investigating massive star-forming regions.

 - **Abstract**
 Observations of millisecond pulsars (MSPs) at low radio frequencies play an important role in understanding the Galactic pulsar population and characterising both their emission properties and the effects of the ionised interstellar medium on the received signals. To date, only a relatively small fraction of the known MSP population has been detected at frequencies below 300 MHz, and nearly all previous MSP studies at these frequencies have been conducted with northern telescopes. We present a census of MSPs in the SMART pulsar survey, covering declinations south of +30 deg at a centre frequency of 154 MHz. We detected 40 MSPs, with 11 being the first published detections below 300 MHz. For each detection, we provide coherently-dedispersed full-polarimetric integrated pulse profiles and mean flux densities. We measured significant Faraday rotation measures (RMs) for 25 MSPs, and identified apparent phase-dependent RM variations for three MSPs. Comparison with published profiles at other frequencies supports previous studies suggesting that the pulse component separations of MSPs vary negligibly over a wide frequency range due to their compact magnetospheres. We observe that integrated pulse profiles tend to be more polarised at low frequencies, consistent with depolarisation due to superposed orthogonal polarisation modes. The results of this census will be a valuable resource for planning future MSP monitoring projects at low frequencies, and will also help to improve survey simulations to forecast the detectable MSP population with the SKA-Low.

 - **Abstract**
 We present observational evidences indicating that dark energy may be evolving with time, thereby challenging the core assumptions of the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. Our investigation extends beyond the standard $\Lambda$CDM model by exploring a range of dynamical dark energy models. The analysis reveals that the matter density parameter, $\Omega_m$, changes with redshift, and this change is significantly influenced by the LRG1 datapoint from the DESI DR2 survey. We find that including LRG1 strongly affects the predictions of these models, especially for $\Omega_m$ and $\omega_0$, with the latter shifting from $-1$ to slightly higher values. This suggests that the evidence of evolving dark energy in the DESI DR2 data is driven by the LRG1 datapoint. When we exclude low-redshift supernovae data, particularly from the DES-SN5YR compilation, the model predictions are restored to the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm. This effect is particularly evident in the GEDE model, where removing low-redshift supernovae data leads to $\Delta = 0$, effectively recovering $\Lambda$CDM paradigm. Our analysis confirms that the evidence for dynamical dark energy is substantial, particularly at low redshift ($z \lesssim 0.3$). The reconstruction of $\omega(z)$ and $f_{DE}(z)$, using a combination of DESI DR2 BAO measurements, CMB distance priors, and supernovae datasets, further supports the evolving nature dark energy. These results favor a dynamical dark-energy scenario characterized by $\omega_0>-1$, $\omega_a<0$, and $\omega_0+\omega_a<-1$ (Quintom-B). Bayesian analysis of model evidence reveals that the inclusion of low-redshift supernovae data significantly strengthens the support for evolving dark energy models such as JBP and Mirage, while models revert to inconclusive or weak support when low-redshift data are excluded.
#### Tracing the Physical Lineage of GRB 211211A: Population Constraints on NS-WD Merger Gamma-Ray Bursts

 - **Abstract**
 The peculiar long gamma-ray burst (GRB) event, GRB 211211A, is known for it is association with a kilonova feature. Whereas most long GRBs are thought to originate in the core collapse of massive stars, the presence of kilonova suggests GRB 211211A was instead produced by a merger of a compact object binary. Building on the interpretation put forward by \citet{Yang2022Natur.612..232Y}--who argue that GRB 211211A was powered by a massive white-dwarf + neutron-star (WD-NS) merger--we adopt this WD-NS scenario as our observationally supported starting point. If the burst truly originates from that channel, its rarity must mirror the formation and merger rate of WD-NS binaries--a rate still largely unexplored in conventional massive-binary population studies. In this letter, we present a qualitative analysis based on binary evolution physics in order to understand the fraction of GRB 211211A in short GRBs (NS-WD/NS-NS fraction). Since the progenitors of massive WD-NS binaries occupy the initial mass function-preferred regime, where the zero-age main-sequence mass range of the assumed WD mass range (1.2-1.4$\,M_\odot$) is comparable to that of NSs, the NS-WD/NS-NS fraction emerging from our standard evolutionary path is expected to be $\sim$14--37\%, far higher than the observed fraction ($\sim5$\%). This discrepancy might imply a large, still-unidentified population of GRB 211211A-like events or an unusual origin of the NS-such as being hypernova-born or accretion-induced-collapse-born. Placing these results in a broader compact-binary context, implications for black-hole systems are also discussed.

 - **Abstract**
 The Wow! Signal, detected in 1977 by the Ohio State University SETI project, remains one of the most intriguing unexplained radio transients. The most recent significant revision of its properties took place in the late 1990s; however, further advances were limited by readily available data from this event. Here we retrieved and analyzed decades of previously unpublished Ohio SETI observations, enabling the most comprehensive re-evaluation of the properties of the Wow! Signal to date with modern methods. Our results reveal significant revisions to its parameters that may help explain why its source has been so difficult to identify. We refine its potential origin to two adjacent fields centered on the right ascension $\alpha=19^{\mathrm h}25^{\mathrm m}02^{\mathrm s} \pm 3^{\mathrm s}$ or $19^{\mathrm h}27^{\mathrm m}55^{\mathrm s} \pm 3^{\mathrm s}$, and the declination $\delta=-26^°57' \pm 20'$ (J2000), a location both narrower and slightly displaced from earlier estimates. We measure a higher peak flux density exceeding 250 Jy and a frequency of $1420.726 \pm 0.005$ MHz, implying a galactic source with a substantially higher radial velocity than previously assumed. Our analysis provides additional support for the hypothesis that the Wow! Signal most likely had an astrophysical origin rather than being attributed to radio interference. In particular, we confirm that small, cold HI clouds can produce narrowband signals similar to its detection, which might suggest a common origin. These findings provide the most precise constraints to date on the location, intensity, and frequency of the Wow! Signal and offer a new path to identify its origin.

 - **Abstract**
 (Abridged) The Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) of the Milky Way exhibits extreme conditions, including high gas densities, elevated temperatures, enhanced cosmic-ray ionization rates, and large-scale dynamics. Large-scale molecular surveys reveal increasing chemical and physical complexity in the CMZ. A key step to interpreting the molecular richness found in the CMZ is to build chemical templates tailored to its diverse conditions. The combined impact of high ionization, elevated temperatures, and dense gas remains insufficiently explored for observable tracers. In this study, we utilized UCLCHEM, a gas-grain time-dependent chemical model, to link physical conditions with their corresponding molecular signatures and identify key tracers of temperature, density, ionization, and shock activity. We ran a grid of models of shocks and protostellar objects representative of typical CMZ conditions, focusing on twenty-four species, including complex organic molecules. Shocked and protostellar environments show distinct evolutionary timescales ($\lesssim 10^4$ vs. $\gtrsim 10^4$ years), with 300 K emerging as a key temperature threshold for chemical differentiation. We find that cosmic-ray ionization and temperature are the main drivers of chemical trends. HCO$^+$, H$_2$CO, and CH$_3$SH trace ionization, while HCO, HCO$^+$, CH$_3$SH, CH$_3$NCO, and HCOOCH$_3$ show consistent abundance contrasts between shocks and protostellar regions over similar temperature ranges. While our models underpredict some complex organics in shocks, they reproduce observed trends for most species, supporting scenarios involving recurring shocks in Galactic Center clouds and enhanced ionization towards Sgr B2(N2). Future work should assess the role of shock recurrence and metallicity in shaping chemistry.

 - **Abstract**
 With the development of ever-improving telescopes capable of observing exoplanet atmospheres in greater detail and number, there is a growing demand for enhanced 3D climate models to support and help interpret observational data from space missions like CHEOPS, TESS, JWST, PLATO, and Ariel. However, the computationally intensive and time-consuming nature of general circulation models (GCMs) poses significant challenges in simulating a wide range of exoplanetary atmospheres. This study aims to determine whether machine learning (ML) algorithms can be used to predict the 3D temperature and wind structure of arbitrary tidally-locked gaseous exoplanets in a range of planetary parameters. A new 3D GCM grid with 60 inflated hot Jupiters orbiting A, F, G, K, and M-type host stars modelled with Exorad has been introduced. A dense neural network (DNN) and a decision tree algorithm (XGBoost) are trained on this grid to predict local gas temperatures along with horizontal and vertical winds. To ensure the reliability and quality of the ML model predictions, WASP-121 b, HATS-42 b, NGTS-17 b, WASP-23 b, and NGTS-1 b-like planets, which are all targets for PLATO observation, are selected and modelled with ExoRad and the two ML methods as test cases. The DNN predictions for the gas temperatures are to such a degree that the calculated spectra agree within 32 ppm for all but one planet, for which only one single HCN feature reaches a 100 ppm difference. The developed ML emulators can reliably predict the complete 3D temperature field of an inflated warm to ultra-hot tidally locked Jupiter around A to M-type host stars. It provides a fast tool to complement and extend traditional GCM grids for exoplanet ensemble studies. The quality of the predictions is such that no or minimal effects on the gas phase chemistry, hence on the cloud formation and transmission spectra, are to be expected.
#### Web-Halo Model (WHM): Accurate non-linear matter power spectrum predictions without free parameters

 - **Abstract**
 We present a parameter-free variant of the halo model that significantly improves the precision of matter clustering predictions, particularly in the challenging 1-halo to 2-halo transition regime, where standard halo models often fail. Unlike HMcode-2020, which relies on 12 phenomenological parameters, our approach achieves comparable or superior accuracy without any free fitting parameters. This new web-halo model (WHM) extends the traditional halo model by incorporating structures that have collapsed along two dimensions (filaments) and one dimension (sheets), in addition to haloes, and combines these with 1-loop Lagrangian Perturbation Theory (1$\ell$-LPT) in a consistent framework. We show that WHM matches N-body simulation power spectra within the precision of state-of-the-art emulators at the 2-halo to 1-halo transition regime at all redshifts. Specifically, the WHM achieves better than 2\% accuracy up to scales of $k = 0.4\, h\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$, $0.7\, h\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$, and $1.3\, h\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ at redshifts $z = 0.0$, $0.8$, and $1.5$, respectively, for both the baccoemu and EuclidEmu2 emulators, across their full $w_0w_a\mathrm{CDM} + \sum m_\nu$ cosmological parameter space. This marks a substantial improvement over 1$\ell$-LPT and HMcode-2020, the latter of which performs similarly at low redshift but deteriorates at higher redshifts despite its 12 tuned parameters. We publicly release WHM as WHMcode, integrated into existing HMcode implementations for CAMB and CLASS.

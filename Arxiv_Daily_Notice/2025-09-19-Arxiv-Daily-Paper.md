 - **Abstract**
 JWST has revealed sulfur chemistry in giant exoplanet atmospheres, where molecules such as SO2 trace photochemistry, metallicity, and formation and migration. To ascertain the conditions that determine whether (or how much) SO2, H2S, and other sulfur-bearing species are present in exoplanet atmospheres, we present a grid of planetary atmospheres covering metallicities from 0.3-1000x Solar and temperatures from 250-2050 K. These models map out the 'SO2 shoreline,' the region of metallicity and irradiation for which SO2 may be sufficiently abundant to be detectable. SO2 is a sensitive indicator of metallicity; expected SO2 abundances also depend strongly on overall temperature and C/O ratio; the SO2 abundance depends surprisingly weakly on XUV irradiation, also weakly on Kzz (for Teq > 600 K), and is essentially independent of internal temperature. Despite its detection in a growing number of giant planets, SO2 is never the dominant sulfur-bearing molecule: depending on temperature and metallicity, H2S, S2, NS, SO, SH, and even S8 or atomic S are frequently as common (or more so) as SO2. Nonetheless SO2 remains the most easily detectable sulfur-bearing species, followed by H2S, though perhaps SO and SH could be detectable in some gas giants. Aside from a pressing need for additional observational constraints on sulfur, we also identify the need for future work to account for the effects of clouds and hazes, fully self-consistent atmospheric models, 2D and 3D models, a wider range of planetary masses and radii, and studies to measure and refine reaction rates and molecular opacities of sulfur-bearing species

 - **Abstract**
 We present new VLTI/GRAVITY astrometry and updated orbit fits for the directly imaged companions YSES 1 b and HR 2562 B, substellar objects straddling the planet-brown dwarf boundary. Using high-precision astrometry, radial velocity (RV) data, and proper motions, we derive revised orbital parameters with orbitize! arXiv:1910.01756. For YSES 1 b, the inclusion of GRAVITY astrometry and a relative radial velocity measurement from arXiv:2409.16660 overcomes the traditional challenge of constraining eccentricities for distant companions, enabling the first orbit fit and yielding a constrained eccentricity of 0.44 (0.20). This represents the first full orbit fit for the system. Additionally, we calculate a median line-of-sight stellar obliquity of 12 (+11, -8) degrees, providing further insight into the system's dynamical architecture. For HR 2562 B, our analysis agrees with arXiv:2302.04893, confirming a low-eccentricity orbit (0.34 (0.20)) and an inclination of 87 (1) degrees. We find HR 2562 B's orbit to be nearly coplanar with the debris disk, with a mutual inclination of 3.7 (0.3) degrees. For both YSES 1 b and HR 2562 B the lower eccentricities favor an in situ formation scenario over extreme scattering or cloud fragmentation.

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmic rays (CRs), from active galactic nuclei (AGN) jets and supernovae (SNe), serve as a significant feedback mechanism influencing emission lines in narrow line region (NLR) clouds. These highly energetic particles, propelled by shocks, heat the interstellar medium (ISM) and modify its chemical composition. This study investigates the role of CRs, particularly in their ability to excite gas and align with observed line ratios across UV and optical diagnostics. We employ CLOUDY to explore CR ionization rate, ionization parameter, and initial hydrogen density effects on optical and mid-infrared (MIR) emission. Our analysis includes high-quality optical data from the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) on the Very Large Telescope (VLT) for NGC 5728, supplemented by infrared observations from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). Our previous results indicate that CRs are instrumental in heating the inner regions of gas clouds, enhancing emission of low-ionization optical lines. Mid-infrared data reveal that emission lines like [Ar II] and [Ne II] within the JWST Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) field of view are sensitive to CRs. In contrast, high-ionization lines (for example, [Ne V]) serve as robust tracers of photoionization insensitive to CRs. Moreover, mixed optical and MIR diagnostics offer insight into the relative roles of CRs and shocks, which often produce similar signatures in emission lines. We find that while both mechanisms can elevate certain line ratios, their influence on MIR diagnostics diverges: shocks and CRs affect low-ionization lines differently, allowing for a better understanding when multi-wavelength data are available. Our approach not only helps to resolve the degeneracy between metallicity and CR ionization but also enables the potential differentiation of shocks and CR-driven processes in AGN.

 - **Abstract**
 A nova super-remnant (NSR) is a greatly-extended structure grown by repeated nova eruptions sweeping the surrounding material away from a nova into a dense outer shell and are predicted to form around all novae. To date, four NSRs are known, with three located in the Galaxy and one residing in M31. Here we present the discovery of the first NSR in the Large Magellanic Cloud and only the second extragalactic nova shell to be identified, hosted by the recurrent nova LMCN 1971-08a. The structure is coincident with the nova, has a circular morphology and is visible in narrowband H$\alpha$ and [S II] filters but very faint in [O III], as expected. HI data also potentially reveal the existence of a coincident structure. Further, with a diameter of ${\sim}200$ pc, this NSR is the largest example yet found, with models indicating an ${\sim}4130 \ \text{M}_{\odot}$ shell expanding at ${\sim}20 \ \text{km} \ \text{s}^{-1}$ into the surrounding medium and an age of $\sim$2.4 Myr. The existence of the NSR also suggests that LMCN 1971-08a may have a much shorter recurrence period than currently presumed.

 - **Abstract**
 How do planetary systems, in general, and our own Solar System (SS), in particular, form? In conjunction, Astronomy and Isotope Cosmochemistry provide us with powerful tools to answer this age-old question. In this contribution, we review recent advances in our understanding of circumstellar disk evolution, including infall and disk processes, as explored through astrophysical models and nucleosynthetic isotope anomalies of SS materials. Astronomically, filamentary structures and anisotropy are observed across the dynamic range of star formation and disk substructures are found to be ubiquitous, highlighting how star- and planet-forming environments are far more complex and dynamic than previously thought. Isotopically, two decades of investigation of nucleosynthetic anomalies in bulk meteorites and refractory inclusions have produced a rich dataset, revealing the existence of pervasive heterogeneity in the early SS, both at the large- (i.e., NC-CC dichotomy) and fine-scale (i.e., trends within the NC group). Using an updated data compilation, we review the systematics and emerging structures of these anomalies as a function of their nucleosynthetic origin. We present the two main families of models - inheritance vs. unmixing - that have been proposed to explain the origin of the observed isotope heterogeneities, and discuss their respective implications for cloud infall and thermal processing in the disk. We also discuss how the extension of nucleosynthetic anomaly analyses to other chondritic components (Ameboid Olivine Aggregates, chondrules, matrix) has started to yield insights into transport, processing and mixing of dust in the disk. Limitations, open questions and key avenues for future work are presented in closing.

 - **Abstract**
 Diffuse emission in gamma-rays and neutrinos are produced by the interaction of cosmic rays with the interstellar medium. Below some hundreds of TeV, the sources of these cosmic rays are most likely Galactic. Hence, observations of high-energy gamma-rays and neutrinos can be used to probe the flux of cosmic rays in other parts of the Galaxy. Supernova remnants are usually considered as the prime candidate for the acceleration of Galactic cosmic rays. They inject cosmic rays in a point-like and specific time-dependent manner. As the precise positions and ages of the sources are not known, predictions must be obtained in a stochastic model. At GeV energies, the distribution of sources can be approximated with a smoothly varying spatial and temporal source density. At hundreds of TeV, however, the point-like nature matters as less sources contribute effectively due to shorter escape times. We have modelled diffuse emissions at hundreds of TeV, relevant for measurements by LHAASO, Tibet AS-gamma, IceCube, and the upcoming SWGO, as well as at tens of GeV, as measured by Fermi-LAT. This reveals the distinctive nature of diffuse emissions at the respective energies which can likely be used to constrain source models and locate cosmic ray sources.
#### Sibling Sub-Neptunes Around Sibling M Dwarfs: TOI-521 and TOI-912

 - **Abstract**
 Sub-Neptunes are absent in the Solar System, yet they are commonly found in our Galaxy. They challenge the internal structure models and prompt investigation on their formation, evolution, and atmospheres. We report the characterisation of new sub-Neptunes orbiting two similar M dwarfs, TOI-521 (T_eff=3544 K), and TOI-912 (T_eff=3572 K). Both stars host a candidate identified by TESS and are part of the THIRSTEE follow-up program, which aims at understanding the sub-Neptune population through precise characterisation studies on a population level. We analysed light curves, ground-based photometry and ESPRESSO, HARPS and IRD RVs to infer precise orbital and physical parameters. The two stars host nearly identical planets in terms of mass and radius. TOI-521 b is a transiting sub-Neptune in a 1.5-d orbit with radius and mass of R=1.98+/-0.14 R_e and M=5.3+/-1.0 M_e respectively. Moreover, we identified an additional candidate at 20.3 d, with a minimum mass of Msini=10.7+/-2.4 M_e currently not detected to transit. Similarly, TOI-912 b is a 4.7-d sub-Neptune with R=1.93+/-0.13 R_e and M=5.1+/-0.5 M_e. Interestingly, TOI-912 b likely has an unusually high eccentricity (e=0.58+/-0.02), and it is probably undergoing strong tidal dissipation. If such eccentricity is confirmed, it would make it one of the most eccentric sub-Neptunes known to date. TOI-521 b and TOI-912 b have very similar densities (4 g/cm^3) and they lie in the degenerate region of the mass-radius diagram where different compositions are plausible, including a volatile-rich composition, or a rocky core surrounded by a H-He envelope. Our sample supports the division of sub-Neptunes into two distinct populations divided by a density gap. Both planets are interesting targets for atmospheric follow-up in the context of understanding the temperature-atmospheric feature trend that starts to emerge thanks to JWST observations.

 - **Abstract**
 Population III (or Pop. III) stars, the first stellar generation built up from metal-free primordial gas, first started to form at redshifts z ~ 30. They formed primarily in small dark matter halos with masses of a few million solar masses. The cooling of the gas in these halos was dominated on all scales by molecular hydrogen. Current theoretical models indicate that Pop. III stars typically formed in small clusters with a logarithmically flat mass function due to widespread fragmentation in the protostellar accretion disks around these primordial stars. Massive Pop. III stars are thought to have played a pivotal role in shaping the early Universe, as their feedback regulates subsequent star formation, although the immediate effects of this feedback remain uncertain. Direct detection of Pop. III stars is challenging, but our chances of detecting at least a few Pop. III supernovae within the next decade are brighter. Indirect approaches based on stellar archaeology or gravitational wave detections offer promising constraints. Current observations suggest that most massive Pop. III stars ended their lives as core-collapse supernovae rather than pair-instability supernovae, offering insight into the initial mass function and evolutionary pathways of these primordial stars.

 - **Abstract**
 The chemical composition of diffuse interstellar clouds is not fully established. They host an active chemistry despite their relatively low density and the ubiquitous presence of far-UV radiation. To further explore the chemical composition of diffuse clouds, we performed a spectral scan toward the bright radio source BL Lac in the Q band (from 32 to 50 GHz) using the Yebes 40m telescope. Yebes observations were performed interleaving Frequency Switching and Position Switching integrations toward BL Lac, using a spectral resolution of 38 kHz. The data have been reduced with the CLASS software. We achieved an unprecedented sensitivity on the continuum of 0.02 - 0.07 %, allowing the detection of very faint absorption features. We confirm previous detections of HCS+, C3H, C3H+, CH3CN and HC3N in diffuse clouds and report new detections of CCS, C4H, CH3CHO, H2CCO , HNCO and H2CS along the line of sight to BL Lac, with abundances relative to H2 from a few 10{-11} to a few 10{-10}. We compiled molecular detections toward diffuse clouds to obtain the chemical inventory of a typical diffuse interstellar cloud. The chemical inventory of diffuse interstellar clouds includes complex organic species with up to four heavy atoms. These species are efficiently formed in the diffuse interstellar gas and reach abundances similar to those measured in dense photodissociation regions, pointing to similar gas phase chemical processes.
#### Studying SNR-MC interactions as galactic PeVatrons in the era of CTAO and ASTRI Mini-Array

 - **Abstract**
 Supernova remnants (SNRs) are widely recognized as key accelerators of Galactic cosmic rays (CRs), supported by the detection of the characteristic pion bump in the gamma-ray spectra of several SNRs. However, the recent observation of ultra-high-energy (UHE, greater than 100 TeV) gamma-rays by LHAASO from sources such as W51 region challenges standard models, which predict CR acceleration up to PeV energies only during the early (~ 100 year) phase of SNR evolution. Given the older age of known SNRs, alternative mechanisms - such as the interaction of runaway CRs with nearby molecular clouds (MCs) - have been proposed to explain the persistent UHE emission. In this study, we focus on the W51 complex, particularly the W51C-B region, as a promising site for investigating SNR-MC interactions. Simulated observations with the CTAO and the ASTRI Mini-Array are presented to demonstrate their crucial role in bridging the energy gap between Fermi-LAT and LHAASO, especially in the 0.3-100 TeV range. Their improved angular resolution will also help disentangle emission components from the interaction zone and nearby sources. Our theoretical modelling suggests that accelerated particles at the shock can account for the radio and GeV data, while UHE emission could be best explained by the combined contribution from both acceleration and adiabatic compression of cloud material at the SNR-MC interface.

 - **Abstract**
 Characterizing the geometry of an object orbiting around a star from its transit light curve is a powerful tool to uncover various complex phenomena. This problem is inherently ill-posed, since similar or identical light curves can be produced by multiple different shapes. In this study, we investigate the extent to which the features of a shape can be embedded in a transit light curve. We generate a library of two-dimensional random shapes and simulate their transit light curves with light curve simulator, Yuti. Each shape is decomposed into a series of elliptical components expressed in the form of Fourier coefficients that adds increasingly diminishing perturbations to an ideal ellipse. We train deep neural networks to predict these Fourier coefficients directly from simulated light curves. Our results demonstrate that the neural network can successfully reconstruct the low-order ellipses, which describe overall shape, orientation and large-scale perturbations. For higher order ellipses the scale is successfully determined but the inference of eccentricity and orientation is limited, demonstrating the extent of shape information in the light curve. We explore the impact of non-convex shape features in reconstruction, and show its dependence on shape orientation. The level of reconstruction achieved by the neural network underscores the utility of using light curves as a means to extract geometric information from transiting systems.

 Context: The detection of the highest energy neutrino observed to date by KM3NeT, with an estimated energy of 220 PeV, opens up new possibilities for the study and identification of the astrophysical sources responsible for a diffuse flux of such ultra-high-energy neutrinos, among which gamma-ray bursts are longstanding candidates. Aims: Based on the event KM3-230213A, we derive constraints on the baryon loading and density of the surrounding environment in models of blastwaves in long-duration gamma-ray bursts. Methods: We compute the diffuse flux from gamma-ray burst blastwaves, either expanding in a constant density interstellar medium or developing in a radially decreasing density of a wind-like environment surrounding the gamma-ray burst progenitor star, by taking into account the expected neutrino spectra and luminosity function. We use a Poisson likelihood method to constrain the blastwave model parameters by calculating the expected number of neutrino events within the 90% confidence level energy range of KM3-230213A and by using the joint exposure of KM3NeT/ARCA, IceCube and Pierre Auger. Results: We constrain the baryon loading to be $\leq \{392, 131, 39, 13\}$ at 90% confidence level, which is inversely proportional to a varying interstellar medium particle density of $\{1, 3, 10, 30\}$ cm$^{-3}$. In the wind-like environment case, the baryon loading is $\leq \{20, 50, 100\}$ at 90% confidence level, which is proportional to the sixth power of a varying density parameter of $\{0.05, 0.06, 0.07\}$.
#### Radial pulsation runaway in massive red supergiants in late evolutionary stage and implications to hydrogen-rich supernovae

 - **Abstract**
 Performing a series of hydrodynamic stellar evolutionary simulations with \textsc{Mesa} (Module for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics), we investigate the excitation and growth of radial pulsations of massive red supergiants (RSGs) with the initial mass range of $M_\mathrm{ini}=13$--$18\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$. We show that strong radial pulsations develop in the hydrogen-rich envelope in their late evolutionary stages, and eventually the surface radial velocity exceeds the escape velocity for higher-mass models. On the other hand, lower-mass models exhibit more moderate pulsations with finite velocity amplitudes and are expected to keep massive hydrogen-rich envelopes when they evolve toward the gravitational collapse of the iron core. While the latter group ends up as a familiar transient population of exploding RSGs, i.e., type IIP supernovae (SNe), the former group may expel a part of their envelopes and explode as different transients population. We investigate how the energy of the oscillating envelope is dissipated and released as radiation. We also empirically determine the condition for the pulsation-driven mass ejection in terms of the luminosity-to-mass ratio, $L/M>10^{3.9}\mathrm{L}_\odot/\mathrm{M}_\odot$. The corresponding luminosity threshold for the explored mass range may explain the observationally inferred constraints on type IIP SN progenitors.

 Early stages of stellar birth comprise of a two-step process involving the formation of two hydrostatic cores. The second step of gravitational collapse sets the radiative efficiency and accretion rate of the young protostar. These two parameters, of prime importance for protostellar evolution, dictate the luminosities and thus play a key role in deciphering the current discrepancy between observational surveys and theoretical models. In this letter, we provide quantitative estimates on the evolution of the radiative efficiency and accretion rate obtained from self-consistent, high-resolution, radiative hydrodynamic simulations performed using the codes PLUTO and RAMSES. The main highlight of our result is that the radiative efficiency reaches unity, that is, supercriticality, relatively quickly after protostellar birth. Supercriticality at the accretion shock is a necessary condition for cold accretion. Our results thus support a rapid transition to the cold accretion scenario, which is one of the assumptions used in Pre-Main Sequence (PMS) models working towards solutions to explain observational data. We briefly discuss the implications of the time evolution of the radiative efficiency factor in the context of the luminosity problem, the Protostellar Luminosity Function (PLF), PMS evolution, accurate sink properties, and the stellar Initial Mass Function (IMF).

 - **Abstract**
 Complex organic molecules (COMs) are thought to be the precursors of pre-biotic molecules and are observed in many protostellar sources. For this paper we studied the formation of COMs during star formation and their evolution in the midplane of the circumstellar disk up to the end of the Class I stage. We used the Analytical Protostellar Environment (APE) code to perform analytical simulations of star formation and the Nautilus code to model the chemical evolution. Most COMs mainly form during the collapse or in the disk, except the lightest (CH3CCH, C3H6, CH3OH, CH3CHO, CH3OCH3, C2H5OH, CH3CN, CH3NC, C2H3CN, and CH3SH), which are significantly inherited by the disk from the prestellar phase. Over the first 150 kyr of the disk, the abundances of several COMs in the midplane vary negligibly (e.g., CH3CCH, CH3OH, and CH3CN), while others experience a variation of one order of magnitude (e.g., C2H3CHO HOCH2CHO, and CH3COCH2OH). Changing physical conditions also have an impact on the abundance profiles of COMs in the disk, and their inheritance. For example, increasing the temperature of the molecular cloud from 10 K to 15 K significantly promotes the formation of COMs in the prestellar phase, notably c-C2H4O and N-bearing species. Conversely, increasing the cloud mass from 2 Msol to 5 Msol only has a minor effect on the disk abundances in the early stages.

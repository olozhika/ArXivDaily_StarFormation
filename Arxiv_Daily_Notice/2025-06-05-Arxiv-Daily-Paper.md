 - **Abstract**
 We present dynamical mass measurements, obtained from multi-epoch Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) observations, for the young multiple stellar system EC\,95, located in the core of the Serpens star-forming region. Our dataset includes both archival data and more recent observations obtained as part of the \textit{Dynamical Masses of Young Stellar Multiple Systems with the VLBA project} (DYNAMO--VLBA), totalling 32 epochs over 12 years of observation. The observations span more than half of the EC\,95AB orbit, which has an estimated period of $21.6\pm0.1$ years, and yield masses of $2.15\pm0.10$ M$_\odot$ for EC\,95A and $2.00\pm0.12$ M$_\odot$ for EC\,95B. Furthermore, for the first time, we have estimated the mass of the third component (EC\,95C) using four available radio detections as well as an infrared observation. We find it to be 0.26 $^{+0.53}_{-0.46}$ M$_\odot$, suggesting that E\,95C is a low-mass T Tauri star. We conclude that EC\,95 is a hierarchical triple system comprised of a tight central binary proto-Herbig\,AeBe system and a lower mass companion on a wider orbit. These results contribute to improve our understanding of the stellar dynamics in this system and provide valuable insights into its triple nature.

 - **Abstract**
 The presence of strong correlations between super-massive black hole (SMBH) masses and galaxy properties like stellar mass have been well-established in the local Universe, but how these scaling relations evolve with cosmic time is yet to be settled in both observations and theoretical models. Recent works have also highlighted the role of galaxy morphology on the scatter of the SMBH-galaxy mass scaling relations, while the impact of other galaxy properties remains poorly studied, like the role of galaxy environment. We use the state-of-the-art SHARK v2.0 semi-analytic model to explore the evolution of these galaxy-SMBH scaling relations to expand the available predictions from theoretical models to contrast with existing and upcoming observations. We find the relations between SMBH masses and both total and bulge stellar mass predicted by SHARK v2.0 to be in good overall agreement with observational measurements across a wide range of redshift and stellar masses. These scaling relations show a significant evolution as a function of cosmic time in SHARK v2.0, with SMBH masses $\sim1$ dex lower at $z=0$ compared to $z=9$ at fixed stellar mass and the scatter increasing by a factor of $\sim2-5$ towards low redshift. Both relations show a strong dependence with galaxy morphology and the main source for SMBH growth (gas accretion or mergers), with smaller trends with star formation rate, galaxy sizes, and environment. We find that galaxy morphology alone explains most of the scatter around both scaling relations, with other galaxy properties tying to the SMBH scaling relations through their correlations with morphology.

 - **Abstract**
 Core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) are regularly observed electromagnetically, prompting targetted searches for their gravitational-wave emission. However, there are scenarios where these powerful explosions may not have any observable electromagnetic signal, but would still have strong detectable emission in gravitational waves and neutrinos. A regular CCSN explosion may be obscured by matter in the Galaxy. A star may undergo a failed CCSN explosion, where the stalled shockwave is not revived, and would eventually form a black hole. Higher mass progenitor stars may revive the shock, but form a black hole too quickly for the shockwave to reach the surface of the star and produce an electromagnetic signal. Previous work has shown that we can determine if a black hole forms from the CCSN neutrino emission if there are long duration sinusoidal modulations in the neutrino signal caused by the standing accretion shock instability (SASI). The SASI also produces an observable signature in the gravitational-wave emission. In this paper, we investigate if we can distinguish between different scenarios for electromagnetically dark CCSNe using the gravitational-wave emission alone. We find, using a reconstruction of the SASI mode, abrupt end times of the gravitational-wave emission, and the rate of change of frequency of the dominant mode, that we are able to accurately distinguish between an obscured CCSN, a failed CCSN, and an explosion with fast black hole formation.

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmic rays (CRs) are an integral part of the non-thermal pressure budget in the interstellar medium (ISM) and are the leading-order ionization mechanism in cold molecular clouds. We study the impacts that different microphysical CR diffusion coefficients and streaming speeds have on the evolution of isothermal, magnetized, turbulent plasmas, relevant to the cold ISM. We utilized a two-moment CR magnetohydrodynamic (CRMHD) model, allowing us to dynamically evolve both CR energy and flux densities with contributions from Alfvénic streaming and anisotropic diffusion. We identify $\textit{coupled}$ and $\textit{decoupled}$ regimes, and define dimensionless Prandtl numbers $\rm{Pm_c}$ and $\rm{Pm_s}$, which quantify whether the plasma falls within these two regimes. In the coupled regime -- characteristic of slow streaming ($\rm{Pm_s} < 1$) and low diffusion ($\rm{Pm_c} < 1$) -- the CR fluid imprints upon the plasma a mixed equation of state between $P_{\rm{c}} \propto \rho^{4/3}$ (relativistic fluid) and $P_{\rm{c}} \propto \rho^{2/3}$ (streaming), where $P_{\rm{c}}$ is the CR pressure, and $\rho$ is the plasma density. By modifying the sound speed, the coupling reduces the turbulent Mach number, and hence the amplitude of the density fluctuations, whilst supporting secular heating of the CR fluid. In contrast, in the decoupled regime ($\rm{Pm_s} > 1$ or $\rm{Pm_c} > 1$) the CR fluid and the plasma have negligible interactions. We further show that CR heating is enabled by coherent structures within the compressible velocity field, with no impact on the turbulence spectrum of incompressible modes.

 - **Abstract**
 Quasi-periodic pulsations (QPPs) are a common feature of impulsive solar flare emissions, yet their driving mechanism(s) remain unresolved. We study long-period (3.4 min) QPPs in the M3.7 flare on Feb 24, 2023, using SDO/AIA and Solar Orbiter/STIX to pinpoint their source and driver. We analyzed UV and HXR emissions from four subregions covering the flare ribbons and footpoints of the erupting filament. We find the QPP characteristics varied significantly across these regions. The strongest UV pulsations, which correlated strongly with HXR emissions, originated from a sequence of flare kernels at the expanding front of the southern flare ribbon. In contrast, another expanding ribbon front showed no pulsations. The spatial coincidence of UV and HXR sources points to non-thermal electrons as a common driver, with the HXR spectrum showing a soft-hard-soft evolution matching the pulsation timescale. We also observed UV pulsations from plasma injections into a separate filament channel, distinct from the main flare kernels. Our results suggest that the spatiotemporal evolution of the pulsations is driven by the propagation of magnetic reconnection in an asymmetric geometry. We propose that slipping reconnection along quasi-separatrix layers is key to generating and moving the UV kernels, potentially modulated by another time-varying process.
#### Differentiable Fuzzy Cosmic-Web for Field Level Inference

 - **Abstract**
 A comprehensive analysis of the cosmological large-scale structure derived from galaxy surveys involves field-level inference, which requires a forward modelling framework that simultaneously accounts for structure formation and tracer bias. While structure formation models are well-understood, the development of an effective field-level bias model remains imprecise, particularly in the context of tracer perturbation theory within Bayesian reconstruction methods, which we address in this work. To bridge this gap, we have developed a differentiable model that integrates augmented Lagrangian perturbation theory, nonlinear, nonlocal, and stochastic biasing. At the core of our approach is the Hierarchical Cosmic-Web Biasing Nonlocal (HICOBIAN) model, which provides a positive definite description of tracer bias while incorporating a long- and short-range nonlocal framework via cosmic-web regions and deviations from Poissonity in the likelihood. A key insight of our model is that transitions between cosmic-web regions are inherently smooth, which we implement using sigmoid-based gradient operations. This enables a fuzzy, and, hence, differentiable hierarchical cosmic-web description, making the model well-suited for machine learning frameworks. Our approach accurately reproduces the primordial density field within associated error bars, as validated by two- and three-point statistics in Fourier space. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the methodology approaches the maximum encoded information consistent with Poisson noise. We introduce a Bayesian field-level inference algorithm that leverages the same forward modelling framework used in galaxy, quasar, and Lyman alpha forest mock catalog generation -- including nonlinear, nonlocal and stochastic bias with redshift space distortions -- providing a unified and consistent approach to the analysis of large-scale cosmic structure.
#### Core-collapse supernova parameter estimation with the upcoming Vera C. Rubin Observatory

 - **Abstract**
 The Vera Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) is expected to revolutionize time-domain optical astronomy as we know it. With its unprecedented depth, the LSST will survey the southern hemisphere sky, generating nearly 32 trillion observations over its nominal 10-year operation. Among these, approximately 10 million will be supernovae (SNe). These observations will uniquely characterize the SN population, enabling studies of known and rare SN types, detailed parameterization of their light curves, deep searches for new SN progenitor populations, the discovery of strongly lensed SNe, and the compilation of a large, well-characterized sample of superluminous SNe. We analyzed a sample of 22663 simulations of LSST light curves for core collapse SNe (CCSNe), modeled using the radiative transfer code STELLA. We analyzed this dataset with the software CASTOR, which enables the reconstruction of synthetic light curves and spectra via a machine learning technique that allows one to retrieve the complete parameter map of a SN. For each parameter we compared the observed and the true values, determining how LSST light curves alone will contribute to characterize the progenitor and the explosion. Our results indicate that LSST alone will not suffice for a comprehensive and precise characterization of progenitor properties and explosion parameters. The limited spectral coverage of LSST light curves (in most cases) does not allow for the accurate estimation of bolometric luminosity, and consequently, of the explosion energy and nickel yield. Additionally, the redshift-absorption degeneracy is difficult to resolve without supplementary information. These findings suggest that for the most interesting SNe, complementary follow-up observations using spectrographs and optical facilities (particularly in the infrared bands) will be essential for accurate parameter determination.
#### Abundance Effects from Protoplanetary Disk Outflows

 - **Abstract**
 Systematic abundance differences that depend on the condensation temperatures of elements have been observed, in particular for stars similar to the Sun; solar twins and solar analogs. Similar differences have also recently been shown to exist between solar abundances and abundances of refractory elements in primitive chondrites. Numerous mechanisms have been proposed to account for these effects, including also differences observed in binary systems. Rather than relying on specific mechanisms, this paper aims to show that the observed effects are a natural and unavoidable outcome of the star formation process itself, in which the associated outflows (winds and jets) carry away material, with efficiency varying with condensation temperature. By using analysis based on modeling results and scaling laws, the trends and magnitudes of the effects are investigated, in three contexts: 1) with respect to differences between the Sun and solar twins, 2) with respect to differences between the Sun and CI-chondrites, and 3) with respect to differences between members of binaries. It is shown that protoplanetary disk outflows indeed are expected to have differential abundance effects, with trends and magnitudes consistent with observed abundance effects. The qualitative as well as semi-quantitative character of the effects are reproduced, in all three contexts. The results demonstrate that the observed systematic differences are likely results of the disk outflows associated with the accretion process. In contrast to mechanisms relying on the tiny mass of planets leaving an observable signature, outflows carry away masses similar to the entire mass of the star, thus much more easily resulting in differential effects with the magnitudes observed, without for example having to assume that the abundance differences are limited to the convection zones of the stars.

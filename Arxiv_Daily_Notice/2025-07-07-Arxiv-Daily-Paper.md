#### Many-Body Simulations of the Fast Flavor Instability

 - **Abstract**
 The neutrino fast flavor instability dominates the evolution of neutrino flavor within the engines of core-collapse supernovae and neutron star mergers. However, theoretical models of neutrino flavor change that include many-body quantum correlations can differ starkly from similar mean-field calculations. We demonstrate for the first time that the inhomogeneous fast flavor instability is disrupted by many-body correlations using a novel tensor network framework that allows a continuous transition between mean-field and many-body results by tuning the singular value decomposition cutoff value. Generalizing the forward-scattering Hamiltonian to spatially varying conditions, we demonstrate that the timescale of flavor transformation scales logarithmically with system size, suggesting that many-body effects could outpace mean-field instabilities even for realistic neutrino numbers. Our results have significant implications for astrophysical explosion dynamics, nucleosynthesis, and observable neutrino signatures.
#### Impact of rotation on synthetic mass-radius relationships of two-layer rocky planets and water worlds

 - **Abstract**
 We have analyzed the effects of rotation on mass-radius relationships for single-layer and two-layer planets having a core and an envelope made of pure materials among iron, perovskite and water in solid phase. The numerical surveys use the DROP code updated with a modified polytropic equation-of-state (EOS) and investigate flattening parameters $f$ up to $0.2$. In the mass range $0.1 M_\oplus < M < 10 M_\oplus$, we find that rotation systematically shifts the curves of composition towards larger radii and/or smaller masses. Relative to the spherical case, the equatorial radius $R_{eq}$ is increased by about $0.36f$ for single-layer planets, and by $0.30f$ to $0.55f$ for two-layer planets (depending on the core size fraction $q$ and planet mass $M$). Rotation is an additional source of confusion in deriving planetary structures, as the radius alterations are of the same order as i) current observational uncertainties for super-Earths, and ii) EOS variations. We have established a multivariate fit of the form $R_{eq}(M,f,q)$, which enables a fast characterization of the core size and rotational state of rocky planets and ocean worlds. We discuss how the observational data must be shifted in the diagrams to self-consistently account for an eventual planet spin, depending on the geometry of the transit (circular/oblate). A simple application to the recently characterized super-Earth candidate LHS1140b is discussed.
#### Exoplanet Atmospheric Refraction Effects in the Kepler Sample
 - **Authors:** Dereck-Alexandre Lizotte, Jason Rowe, James Sikora, Michael R. B. Matesic

 - **Abstract**
 We present an analysis on the detection viability of refraction effects in Kepler's exoplanet atmospheres using binning techniques for their light curves in order to compare against simulated refraction effects. We split the Kepler exoplanets into sub-populations according to orbital period and planetary radius, then search for out-of-transit changes in the relative flux associated with atmospheric refraction of starlight. The presence of refraction effects - or lack thereof - may be used to measure and set limits on the bulk properties of an atmosphere, including mean molecular weight or the presence of hazes. In this work, we use the presence of refraction effects to test whether exoplanets above the period-radius valley have H/He atmospheres, which high levels of stellar radiation could evaporate away, in turn leaving rocky cores below the valley. We find strong observational evidence of refraction effects for exoplanets above the period-radius valley based on Kepler photometry, however those related to optically thin H/He atmospheres are not common in the observed planetary population. This result may be attributed to signal dampening caused by clouds and hazes, consistent with the optically thick and intrinsically hotter atmospheres of Kepler exoplanets caused by relatively close host star proximity.
#### Large Scale Wind Driven Structures in the Orion Nebula

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02147

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.02147

 - **Abstract**
 A study of [C II] 158 micron and HI 21-cm spectroscopic images plus high velocity resolution optical and ultraviolet spectra has shown the structure of the Orion Nebula to be different from that found from the study of those data separately. The [C II] features recently identified as the [C II] Shell is shown to be part of the Veil-B HI foreground layer. Jointly called the Outer Shell, it covers the bright Huygens Region and the Extended Orion Nebula. Its maximum expansion velocity is 15 km/s. Closer to ThetaOne OrionisC there is a second expanding shell, called the Inner Shell. It has an expansion velocity of 27 km/s and probably results from a more recent period of strong wind from one or more of the Trapezium stars. Even closer to ThetaOne OrionisC there is a central high ionization bubble, freely expanding towards the observer but slowed in the opposite direction by photo-ionized gas coming off the Main Ionization Front. Utilization of spectroscopic measures of the equivalent width of Hbeta shows that the enhanced emission in [C II] seen just outside the visual wavelength boundaries of the Orion Nebula is not caused by limb-brightening of the Outer Shell. This enhanced emission is due to the radiation field of the Trapezium stars being filtered by intervening residual neutral hydrogen. A velocity component near 30 km/s (Heliocentric) first seen in HI is also present in [C II] and may result from a foreground cloud of the ISM.
#### XRISM analysis of the complex Fe K$α$ line in Centaurus A

 - **Abstract**
 We analyze the high-resolution XRISM/Resolve spectrum of the Fe K$\alpha$ emission line of the nearest active galactic nucleus, in Centaurus A. The line features two narrow and resolved peaks of Fe K$\alpha_1$, and Fe K$\alpha_2$ with a FWHM of $(4.8\pm0.2)\times10^2$ km/s each. A broad line with a FWHM of $(4.3\pm0.3)\times10^3$ km/s, and with a flux similar to the two narrow line cores, is also required. This broad component is not observed in the optical or IR spectra of Cen A. The line shape requires the existence of an emission region that extends from $\sim10^{-3}$ pc to $\sim10^1$ pc. Assuming that the emissivity follows a radial power-law profile of $r^{-q}$, we find $q\approx2$. This may indicate an extended corona, an emitting region that bends towards the corona, or a non-uniform density. When assuming $q=3$, the line shape can only be reproduced by including three emitting components in the model. The measured best-fit inclination is $24^{+13}_{-7}$ degrees, but higher inclinations are only slightly disfavored. A single blurred MYTorusL line profile can describe the line shape, but requires a large relative normalization. This could be due to past variability, modified abundances, or differing geometries. The line shape can be reproduced from the radii measured by reverberation mapping, but only if an additional extended emitting region at small radii is included.
#### Ammonia in the hot core W51-IRS2: Maser line profiles, variability, and saturation

 - **Abstract**
 W51-IRS2 is known to be one of the most prolific sources of interstellar ammonia (NH$_3$) maser lines. So far, however, many of these inversion lines have rarely been studied. Here we report spectrally resolved line profiles for the majority of detected features and provide information on the variability of these maser components between 2012 and 2023. This includes the first tentative detection of a ($J$,$K$) = (5,2) maser in the interstellar medium and the first tentative detection of a (6,4) maser in W51-IRS2. Furthermore, we report for the first time NH$_3$ (9,6) maser emission below Local Standard of Rest velocities of 50 km s$^{-1}$ in this source as well as double maser features occasionally seen in other transitions. The detected maser lines strongly indicate vibrational pumping by $\approx$10 $\mu$m photons, which must be abundant due to the high kinetic temperature ($\approx$300 K) of the ammonia emitting gas. The detection of vibrationally excited NH$_3$, suggesting a vibrational excitation temperature consistent with the kinetic one, and a comparison with measured SiO line profiles is also presented. For the (10,7) line, we find a tentative correlation between flux density and line width compatible with unsaturated maser emission. The velocity drift of the so-called 45 km s$^{-1}$ maser features, reported to be +0.2 km s$^{-1}$ yr$^{-1}$ between 1996 and 2012, has either slowed down to values $<$0.1 km s$^{-1}$ or has entirely disappeared. In 2023, the component is only seen in ammonia inversion lines that are located at least 800 K above the ground state. The other features have faded. Possible scenarios explaining this phenomenon are discussed.
#### The SOMA-POL Survey. I. Polarization and magnetic field properties of massive protostars

 - **Abstract**
 The role of magnetic fields in regulating the formation of massive stars remains much debated. Here we present sub-millimeter polarimetric observations with JCMT-POL2 at $850\:\mu$m of 13 regions of massive star formation selected from the SOFIA Massive (SOMA) star formation survey, yielding a total of 29 massive protostars. Our investigation of the $p'-I$ relationship suggests that grain alignment persists up to the highest intensities. We examine the relative orientations between polarization-inferred magnetic field direction and source column density elongation direction on small and large scales. On small scales, we find a bimodal distribution of these relative orientations, i.e., with an excess of near-parallel and near-perpendicular orientations. By applying a one-sample Kuiper test and Monte Carlo simulations to compare to a relative orientation distribution drawn from a uniform distribution, we statistically confirm this bimodal distribution, independent of the methods to measure structural orientation. This bimodal distribution suggests that magnetic fields are dynamically important on the local scales ($\lesssim 0.6\:$pc) of massive protostellar cores. We also examine how basic polarization properties of overall degree of polarization and local dispersion in polarization vector orientations depend on intrinsic protostellar properties inferred from spectral energy distribution (SED) modeling. We find a statistically significant anti-correlation between the debiased polarized fraction and the luminosity to mass ratio, $L_{\rm bol}/M_{\rm env}$, which hints at a change in the dust properties for protostellar objects at different evolutionary stages.
#### On the width and profiles of cosmic filaments

 - **Abstract**
 We investigated the widths and profiles of cosmic filaments using the IllustrisTNG simulations. Filaments were identified with DisPerSE, using galaxy samples in simulations as input. Since the width of an individual filament can vary significantly along its spine, we divided each filament into segments with lengths between $1.5\,h^{-1}\,\mathrm{Mpc}$ and $2.5\,h^{-1}\,\mathrm{Mpc}$ and measure their properties. The typical width of these filament segments increases gradually from approximately $0.3\,\mathrm{Mpc}$ at redshift $z = 2.0$ to about $1.0-1.5\,\mathrm{Mpc}$ at $z = 0.0$. We find that the segment width correlates nearly linearly with the linear halo mass density, consistent with previous studies. A similar linear relation is observed between the segment width and the linear stellar mass density, providing a potential estimator for filament width. Furthermore, the density profiles of filaments with different widths exhibit self-similarity and can be described by a unified formula akin to the isothermal $\beta$-model. For segments with a given width, the rescaled density profiles show only mild evolution from $z = 2.0$ to $z = 0.0$. Within the filament width, the gas temperature decreases slowly from the center to the boundary, with thicker filaments generally containing hotter gas than thinner ones. These trends in filament width, density, and thermal profiles are consistently observed across the TNG50, TNG100, and TNG300 simulations, and align well with results from earlier studies. We briefly discuss the potential implications and applications of our findings.
#### Massive Interacting Binaries Enhance Feedback in Star-Forming Regions

 - **Abstract**
 We present a new framework to incorporate feedback from massive interacting binaries in simulations of star cluster formation. Our new feedback model adds binary stellar evolution to the cluster formation code Torch, and couples it in AMUSE to the pre-existing modules for collisional stellar dynamics, magnetohydrodynamics, and mechanical and radiative feedback. Our model accounts for the effects of mass transfer on the stars' mass loss rates, their radiation spectra, and the timing of core-collapse supernovae. It also injects mass lost through non-conservative mass transfer and common envelope ejection into the interstellar medium. We demonstrate the use of our feedback model through simulations of isolated binaries in a gaseous medium, and of embedded clusters of massive binaries. Feedback from interacting binaries efficiently couples with the surrounding interstellar medium. It increases the size of HII regions, increases the kinetic and thermal energy of the gas, and increases the pressure within HII regions compared to models that use single star stellar evolution. Those differences arise from the ionizing radiation, which increases by three orders of magnitude, resulting in HII regions that expand due to thermal pressure rather than radiation pressure. The effects of stellar dynamics and the gravitational potential of the background gas cause the evolution of individual binaries to deviate from the predictions made by secular evolution, impacting the subsequent feedback from the binary. We conclude that massive interacting binaries are an important source of feedback in cluster-forming regions, and must be considered when studying the emerging timescales of young star clusters.
#### A Highly Carbon-Rich Dayside and Disequilibrium Chemistry in the Ultra-Hot Jupiter WASP-19b

 - **Abstract**
 Ultra-hot Jupiters (UHJs) offer exceptional opportunities for detailed atmospheric characterization via emission spectroscopy. Here we present a comprehensive analysis of the dayside atmosphere of WASP-19b$\unicode{x2014}$one of the shortest-period UHJs$\unicode{x2014}$using archival JWST NIRSpec/PRISM observations spanning 0.6-5.3 $\mu$m. We report robust detections of H$_2$O (16.44 $\sigma$), CO (5.47 $\sigma$), and CO$_2$ (10.72 $\sigma$), along with marginal detections of CH$_4$ (3.76 $\sigma$) and C$_2$H$_2$ (2.45 $\sigma$). The retrieved composition reveals a highly carbon-rich atmosphere with a tightly constrained super-solar C/O ratio of 0.94$\pm$0.03. Elevated abundances of carbon-bearing species provide strong evidence (11.69 $\sigma$) for disequilibrium chemistry. We also detect condensate clouds, likely Al$_2$O$_3$(c), at high significance (17.28 $\sigma$), and constrain the atmospheric metallicity to 1.7$_{-0.7}^{+1.2}$ $\times$ solar. These results establish a precise benchmark for modeling dayside conditions in extreme irradiated atmospheres and demonstrate JWST's transformative capabilities for exoplanet science.

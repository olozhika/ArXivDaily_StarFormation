 - **Abstract**
 The most recently formed young stellar objects (YSOs) in active star forming regions are excellent tracers of their parent cloud motion. Their positions and dynamics provide insight into cluster formation and constrain kinematic decoupling timescales between stars and gas. However, because of their strong extinction and young age, embedded YSOs are mainly visible at infrared wavelengths and thus absent from astrometric surveys such as Gaia. We measured the proper motions of 6,769 sources toward the NGC 2024 cluster in the Flame Nebula using multi-epoch near-infrared observations from three ESO public surveys: VISIONS, VHS, and the VISTA/VIRCAM science verification program. Cross-validation of our results with Gaia using optically visible stars shows excellent agreement, with uncertainties on the same order of magnitude. For 362 YSO candidates identified from the literature, we derived proper motions on the order of <5 mas/yr with mean measurement uncertainties of ~0.22 mas/yr. This is the first homogeneous proper motion measurement of this quality for more than half of these stars. For Class I and flat-spectrum sources, our results provide a >13-fold increase in available proper motion measurements. We analyzed the positional and kinematic differences between YSO classes and confirmed a previously reported inside-out age segregation from younger to older stars, likely driven by an outward movement of older stars. No evidence of prolonged hierarchical assembly was found. Instead, the results support a rapid (<1 Myr) cluster collapse. This scenario also accounts for the observed slightly higher 1D velocity dispersion of Class I sources relative to Class flat objects. YSO radial velocities generally align with the gas velocities measured from 12CO(3-2), HNC(1-0), HCN(1-0), and show a weaker correlation with N_2H+(1-0). Some Class II and III objects appear to be already decoupling.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the OASIS survey program discovery of a substellar companion orbiting the young A1V star HIP 71618, detected using precision astrometry from \textit{Gaia and Hipparcos} and high-contrast imaging with SCExAO/CHARIS and Keck/NIRC2. Atmospheric modeling favors a spectral type of M5--M8 and a temperature of $\sim$2700 $\pm$ 100 $K$. Dynamical modeling constrains HIP 71618 B's mass to be ${60}_{-21}^{+27}$ $M_{\rm Jup}$ or ${65}_{-29}^{+54}$ $M_{\rm Jup}$, depending on the adopted companion mass prior. It has a nearly edge-on, 11 au-orbit with a high eccentricity. HIP 71618 B will be located within Roman Coronagraph's dark hole region during the instrument's technological demonstration phase. A high signal-to-noise ratio detection of HIP 71618 B at 575 nm would demonstrate a 5-$\sigma$ contrast of 10$^{-7}$ or better. The system is also located within or very close to Roman's Continuous Viewing Zone -- near multiple candidate reference stars for dark-hole digging -- and its primary is bright ($V$ $\approx$ 5). The suitability of HIP 71618 as one potential Roman Coronagraph target for demonstrating the instrument's core requirement (TTR5) should motivate the timely, deep vetting of candidate reference stars.
#### Ripples in the baryon to dark matter ratio in $Λ$CDM: implications for galaxy formation

 - **Abstract**
 We use the FLAMINGO galaxy formation model to quantify the impact of baryon-CDM isocurvature perturbations on galaxy formation in $\Lambda$CDM. In linear theory, these perturbations represent local, compensated variations in the ratio between the baryon and CDM densities; they freeze in amplitude at late times, with an RMS amplitude of $1.5\%$ on the Lagrangian scale of a $10^{11}\,\rm M_\odot$ halo ($0.85\, \rm{Mpc}$). Although such perturbations arise naturally within $\Lambda$CDM, most cosmological simulations and semi-analytic models to date omit them. These perturbations are strongly anti-correlated with the matter overdensity field such that halos form with baryon fractions below the cosmic mean, with earlier-collapsing halos exhibiting stronger baryonic suppression. To isolate the galaxy response, we analyse three hydrodynamical simulations with identical initial matter overdensity fields that: i) include isocurvature modes, ii) omit them, or iii) invert their amplitude. At $z=8$, isocurvature perturbations reduce the mean baryon fraction and star formation rates of resolved halos by $ 5\%$ and $ 12\%$, respectively, relative to the null-isocurvature case. These effects are almost independent of halo mass and diminish steadily with time, reaching $ 0.1\%$ and $ 1\%$ by $z=0$. We develop a model based on spherical collapse that accurately reproduces the mean baryon fraction suppression. As high-redshift observations become increasingly routine, incorporating isocurvature perturbations into simulations and semi-analytic models will be important for robust predictions of early galaxy and black hole formation in the JWST era.
#### The SPHINX M dwarf Spectral Grid. II. New Model Atmospheres and Spectra to Derive Fundamental Properties of mid-to-late type M-dwarfs

 - **Abstract**
 M-dwarfs are the most dominant stars in the Galaxy. Their interiors and atmospheres exhibit complex processes including dust condensation, convective feedback, and magnetic activity-driven heterogeneity. Standard stellar characterization methods often struggle to capture these coupled effects. Part I of this series introduced SPHINX I, a validated grid of self-consistent radiative-convective model atmospheres and spectra for M-dwarfs with up-to-date molecular opacities suitable for early-to-mid M-dwarfs. Here, we present SPHINX II, which extends the model grid to cover mid-to-late type M-dwarfs, including both gray and physically motivated condensate cloud treatments and shorter convective mixing lengths. We validate SPHINX II using 39 benchmark FGK+M binary systems observed with SpeX IRTF (Mann et al. 2014) and apply it to 32 mid-to-late-type M-dwarfs from the SpeX Prism Library. SPHINX II yields improved fits that are statistically consistent with empirical benchmarks, achieving precisions of 0.078 dex in metallicity and 0.13 dex in C/O. Across the model grid, condensate cloud mass peaks between 2100-2400 K, decreasing sharply toward both cooler and hotter temperatures. We find the onset of the cloud-free regime around 2900 K, and below 2100 K, we see formation of deep/buried clouds. As a case study, we also model Trappist-1 and show that even mass-limited silicate grains subtly modify its emergent spectrum, suppressing near-infrared flux and reddening the mid-infrared slope via shallow cloud formation near 1e-2 bar. In sum, SPHINX II provides an improved framework for constraining the fundamental properties of mid-to-late M-dwarfs.

 - **Abstract**
 The formation channels of binary neutron stars (BNSs) remain uncertain. The detection of GW190425 by LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA (LVK) suggests a subpopulation of massive BNSs, possibly formed through unstable "case BB" mass transfer with short merger delays. We investigate whether next-generation detectors such as the Einstein Telescope (ET) can identify and characterise such subpopulations. Using the latest LVK constraints on the BNS merger rate, we generate mock ET catalogues containing a mixture of light and heavy subpopulations. The redshift distribution of each subpopulation is modeled as the convolution of the cosmic star formation rate with a time-delay distribution: heavy BNSs have fixed short delays, while light BNSs follow power-law delays with indices -0.5,-1,-1.5. Hierarchical Bayesian analyses are then performed on catalogues of 100-5,000 events. With hundreds of detections from ET, we will be able to establish that the total mass distribution is bimodal. A few thousand events are sufficient to disentangle the redshift distributions of the two subpopulations for moderate time-delay indices (-0.5 or -1). For steeper indices (-1.5), the differences are more subtle, requiring larger catalogues, beyond what we could explore given our computational resources. Next-generation detectors should enable the detection of multiple BNS subpopulations and their redshift evolution, providing valuable insight into their formation pathways.
#### Radio, X-ray, and EUV signatures of internal and external reconnection of an erupting flux rope

 - **Abstract**
 We analyse imaging (EUV, X-ray) and spectral (radio, X-ray) data obtained by ground based and space instruments on board space missions both on Earth (Fermi, Hinode, Solar Dynamics Observatory) and solar orbit (Solar Orbiter, STEREO-A), which provide a multi-directional view on the same event. The combination of EUV and X-ray images and X-ray spectra allowed us to identify hot loops in the vicinity of the filament before its eruption. We interpreted their interaction with the rising filament as a signature of an arcade-to-rope reconnection geometry. The subsequent EUV brightening within the filament revealed helical structure of the erupting rope. We explained co-temporal radio slowly positively drifting bursts as a result of beam acceleration within the magnetic rope and propagation along the helical structure. Corresponding X-ray spectra were consistent with a thermal origin. The filament rising was accompanied by co-temporal normal and reverse drift type III radio bursts. We interpreted them as a signature of a reconnection event and estimated electron density at the reconnection site. Further untwisting of the helical structure led to formation of a quasi-circular EUV structure seen from Earth and STEREO-A. Its occurrence was co-temporal with a unique tangle of radio U- and inverse U-bursts. We proposed that several accelerated beams propagate within that complex structure and generate the burst tangle. During the start of the flare hard X-ray emission was concentrated near the filament leg only suggesting predominant propagation of the beams towards its rooting. We collected multi-wavelength observations indicating interaction of the erupting magnetic flux rope with the overlying arcade and internal magnetic reconnection inside the rising flux rope.
#### Stranger Things: A Grid-based Survey of Strange Modes in Post-Main Sequence Models

 - **Abstract**
 We present a systematic survey of strange mode pulsations in Cepheids using MESA and for the linear stability analysis, MESA RSP. Our model grid spans $2-15\,M_\odot$ in mass and [Fe/H] $= -0.95$-$0.17$ ($Z = 0.0015$-$0.0200$) in metallicity, with four convective overshoot prescriptions. Strange modes were identified in a relatively small fraction ($5-12.5$ %) of models, occurring at $n_\mathrm{pg} = 5-9$, with $n_\mathrm{pg} = 6$-$7$ as the most frequent radial modes. No unstable solutions were identified beyond $n_\mathrm{pg} = 9$, in contrast to earlier studies reporting strange modes at $n_\mathrm{pg} = 10-12$. We quantified the duration of the instability crossing phase ($\tau_\mathrm{IS}$), the strange mode phase ($\tau_\mathrm{s}$), and their ratio $\mathcal{P}_\mathrm{s} = \tau_\mathrm{s} / \tau_\mathrm{IS}$. Toward higher masses, both $\tau_\mathrm{IS}$ and $\tau_\mathrm{s}$ decrease, yet their ratio shows no systematic trend with mass in models that include convective core overshoot. The absolute timescales for strange modes remain short, typically $\tau_\mathrm{s} \sim 10^{4.5}$-$10^{6}$ years, while $\tau_\mathrm{IS}$ is often an order of magnitude shorter, implying that these stars may spend a larger fraction of their life in the strange mode phase than in the instability strip itself. The extended duration of the strange mode phase may enhance the detectability of strange mode pulsators, provided that observational precision is sufficient to capture their low-amplitude variability. The predicted periods ($0.6-6.3$ days) are well covered by a single $27-$day TESS sector, making strange mode pulsators potentially detectable with current space-based photometry, although blending with nearby sources may pose challenges.

 - **Abstract**
 The cosmological distribution and formation rate of compact astrophysical objects such as fast radio bursts (FRBs) are typically assumed to be proportional to a linear combination of cosmological star formation rate and stellar mass. In the literature, a template for star formation rate, which is just a function of redshift, is typically used. In this work, we point out the importance of galaxy stellar mass function which captures the host galaxy information of observed FRBs as well as the redshift evolution of galaxy stellar mass. Using this information, we find that FRB formation efficiency per stellar mass has to be more efficient (by a factor of $\approx 3$) than previously calculated, in order to reproduce the observed volumetric rate of FRBs at $z=0$. We show that cosmological population studies of FRBs have to include host galaxy information along with its redshift evolution in order to obtain unbiased results. This consideration is also applicable to other transients, e.g. gamma-ray bursts and merging binary black hole events. We show that our approach may open up the possibility to infer the host galaxy stellar mass of merging binary black holes with a detection of few thousand gravitational wave events.
#### Peculiar SN Ic 2022esa: An explosion of a massive Wolf-Rayet star in a binary as a precursor to a BH-BH binary?

 - **Abstract**
 A class of supernovae (SNe) termed `SN Ic-CSM' are characterized by late-time emergence of narrow emission lines of elements formed in the oxygen core of a massive star. A popular scenario is the interaction of the SN ejecta and O-rich circumstellar medium (CSM), i.e., Circumstellar Interaction (CSI). Uncovering the progenitor system of SNe Ic-CSM plays a critical role in understanding the final evolution of a massive star to a bare C+O star. In this Letter, we present observations of SN 2022esa which we show is an SN Ic-CSM. Surprisingly, a stable periodicity of ~32 days is found in its light-curve evolution with a hint of a slowly increasing period over ~200 days. We argue that the main power source is likely the interaction of the SN ejecta and O-rich CSM, while the energy input by the post-SN eccentric binary interaction within the SN ejecta is another possibility. In either case, we propose a massive Wolf-Rayet (WR) star as the progenitor, in a WR-WR or WR-BH (black hole) binary that will eventually evolve to a BH-BH binary. Specifically, in the CSI scenario, the progenitor system is an eccentric binary system with an orbital period of about a year, leading to the observed periodicity through the modulation in the CSM density structure. We also show that some other objects, superluminous SN I 2018ibb (a pair-instability SN candidate) and peculiar SN Ic 2022jli (the first example showing stable periodic modulation), show observational similarities to SNe Ic-CSM and may be categorized as SN Ic-CSM variants. Complemented with a large diversity in their light-curve evolution, we propose that SNe Ic-CSM (potentially linked to SNe Ibn/Icn) are a mixture of multiple channels that cover a range of properties in the progenitor star, the binary companion, and the binary orbit.

 - **Abstract**
 The chemical abundance of the interstellar medium sets the initial conditions for star formation and provides a probe of chemical galaxy evolution models. However, unresolved inhomogeneities in the electron temperature can lead to a systematic underestimation of the abundances. We aim to directly test this effect. We use the SDSS-V Local Volume Mapper to spatially map the physical conditions of the Trifid Nebula (M 20), a Galactic H II region ionized by a single mid-type O star, at 0.24 pc resolution. We exploit various emission lines (e.g., Hydrogen recombination lines and collisionally excited lines, including also faint auroral lines) and compute spatially resolved maps of [O II] and [S II] electron densities; [N II], [O II], [S II], [S III] electron temperatures; and the ionic oxygen abundances. We find internal variations of electron density that result from the ionization front, along with a negative radial gradient. However, we do not find strong gradients or structures in the electron temperature and the total oxygen abundance, making the Trifid Nebula a relatively homogeneous H II region at the observed spatial scale. We compare these spatially resolved properties with equivalent integrated measurements of the Trifid Nebula and find no significant variations between integrated and spatially resolved conditions. This isolated H II region, ionized by a single O-star, represents a test case of an ideal Strömgren sphere. The physical conditions in the Trifid Nebula behave as expected, with no significant differences between integrated and resolved measurements.

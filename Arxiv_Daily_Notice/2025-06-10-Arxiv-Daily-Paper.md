 - **Abstract**
 Red giants undergo dramatic and complex structural transformations as they evolve. Angular momentum is transported between the core and envelope during this epoch, a poorly understood process. Here, we infer envelope and core rotation rates from Kepler observations of $\sim$1517 red giants. While many measurements are consistent with the existing studies, our investigation reveals systematic changes in the envelope-to-core rotation ratio and we report the discovery of anomalies such as clump stars with rapidly rotating cores, and red giants with envelopes rotating faster than their cores. We propose binary interactions as a possible mechanism by which some of these cores and envelopes are spun up. These results pose challenges to current theoretical expectations and can have major implications for compact remnants born from stellar cores.
#### Searching for Historical Extragalactic Optical Transients Associated with Fast Radio Bursts

 - **Abstract**
 We present a systematic search for past supernovae (SNe) and other historical optical transients at the positions of fast radio burst (FRB) sources to test FRB progenitor systems. Our sample comprises 83 FRBs detected by the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME) and its KKO Outrigger, along with 93 literature FRBs representing all known well-localized FRBs. We search for optical transients coincident in position and redshift with FRBs and find no significant associations within the 5-sigma FRB localization uncertainties except for a previously identified potential optical counterpart to FRB 20180916B. By constraining the timescale for SN ejecta to become transparent to FRB emission, we predict that it takes at least 6-10 years before the FRB emission can escape. From this, we infer that approximately 7% of matched optical transients, up to 30% of currently known SNe, and up to 40% of core-collapse SNe could have an observable FRB based on timescales alone. We derive the number of new, well-localized FRBs required to produce one FRB-SN match by chance, and find it will take ~ 22,700 FRBs to yield one chance association at the projected CHIME/FRB Outrigger detection rate. Looking forward, we demonstrate redshift overlap between SNe detected by the upcoming Vera C. Rubin Observatory and CHIME/FRB Outrigger FRBs, indicating the prospect of an increase in potential associations at redshift z < 1. Our framework is publicly available, flexible to a wide range of transient timescales and FRB localization sizes, and can be applied to any optical transient populations in future searches.
#### Pavo: Stellar feedback in action in a low-mass dwarf galaxy

 - **Abstract**
 MeerKAT observations of the recently discovered, extremely low mass galaxy, Pavo, have revealed a neutral gas (HI) reservoir that was undetected in archival HI single dish data. Based on the latest distance measurement ($2.16^{+0.08}_{-0.07}$ Mpc), we measure Pavo's HI mass as $\log M_\mathrm{HI}/\mathrm{M_\odot} = 5.79 \pm 0.05$, making it the lowest mass HI reservoir currently known in an isolated galaxy (with a robust distance measurement). Despite Pavo's extreme isolation, with no known neighbor within over 700 kpc, its HI reservoir is highly disturbed. It does not show clear signs of rotation and its center of mass is offset from the stellar body center by 320 pc, while its peak is offset by 82 pc (both in projection). Despite this disturbed morphology, Pavo still appears to be consistent with the HI size--mass relation, although it is not possible to accurately determine a suitable inclination correction. Such disturbed, offset and disorganized HI reservoirs are predicted by simulations of low-mass, star-forming dwarfs in which supernova-driven outflows efficiently disrupt the interstellar medium after a star formation event. It is likely that we are witnessing Pavo in precisely this period, tens to a few hundred Myr after a star formation episode, when internal feedback has disrupted its gas reservoir.

 - **Abstract**
 The cores of neutron stars (NSs) contain the densest matter in the universe. Rapid advancements in neutron-star observations allow unprecedented empirical access to cold, ultra-dense Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) matter. The combination of these observations with theoretical calculations has revealed previously inaccessible features of the equation of state (EoS) and the QCD phase diagram. In this thesis, I demonstrate how perturbative-QCD calculations at asymptotically high baryon densities provide robust constraints on the EoS at neutron-star densities. The method for constraint propagation is based solely on thermodynamical causality, stability, and consistency of the EoS. By constructing a large ensemble of EoSs using Gaussian processes regression and incorporating it into a Bayesian inference of EoS, I demonstrate that the novel pQCD constraints go beyond those obtained from current astrophysical observations alone, forcing the EoS to soften at the maximum densities of stable neutron stars. This softening of the EoS can be interpreted as an indication of approximate conformal symmetry restoration, a sign of a first-order phase transition (FOPT), or potentially both. I show that the conformal symmetry restoration is consistent with the hypothesis of quark matter cores inside the most massive NSs. Although current astrophysical data and theoretical inputs cannot definitively distinguish between the two scenarios, they slightly favor the occurrence of a phase transition of some kind - whether a crossover to quark matter or a destabilizing FOPT - in the cores of the most massive neutron stars.

 - **Abstract**
 The sub-millimetre dust opacity spectral index is a critical observable to constrain dust properties, such as the maximum grain size of an observed dust population. It has been widely measured at galactic scales and down to protoplanetary disks. However, because of observational and analytical challenges, quite a gap exists in measuring dust properties in the envelopes that feed newborn protostars and their disks. To fill this gap, we use sensitive dust continuum emission data at 1.2 and 3.1 mm from the ALMA FAUST Large Program and constrain the dust opacity millimetre spectral index around a sample of protostars. Our high-resolution data, along with a more refined methodology with respect to past efforts, allow us to disentangle disk and envelope contributions in the uv-plane, and thus measure spectral indices for the envelopes uncontaminated by the optically thick emission of the inner regions. First, we find that the young disks are small and optically thick. Secondly, we measure the dust opacity spectral index at envelope scales for n=11 sources: the beta of n=9 sources had never been constrained in the literature. We effectively double the number of sources for which the dust opacity spectral index beta has been measured at these scales. Third, combining the available literature measurements with our own (total n=18), we show how envelope spectral indices distribute between ISM-like and disk-like values, bridging the gap in the inferred dust evolution. Finally, we statistically confirm a significant correlation between beta and the mass of protostellar envelopes, previously suggested in the literature. Our findings indicate that the dust optical properties smoothly vary from the ISM, through envelopes and all the way down to disks. Multi-wavelength surveys are needed to further this study and make more general claims on dust evolution in its pathway from cloud to disks.
#### Comparative Testing of Subgrid Models for Fast Neutrino Flavor Conversions in Core-collapse Supernova Simulations

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate key methodologies of Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook subgrid modeling for neutrino fast flavor conversions (FFC) in core-collapse supernova based on spherically symmetric Boltzmann radiation hydrodynamics simulations. We first examine time integration methods (explicit, implicit, or semi-implicit) and time step control for the subgrid term, and then compare various approaches in the literature approximating FFCs in two aspects: (1) angular dependent survival probability of neutrinos versus simple equipartition condition with a certain baryon mass density threshold, and (2) 4-species treatment versus 3-species assumption ($\nu_x=\bar\nu_x$). We find that the equipartition condition is reasonable for out-going neutrinos, but large deviations emerge in the incoming neutrinos, that has an influence on matter profiles. We also find that the 3-species model, in which flavor conversions evolve towards erasing electron neutrino lepton number (ELN) crossings, behave differently from the 4-species models where heavy leptonic neutrino number (XLN) are appropriately treated in FFC subgrid modeling. In 4-species models, we commonly observe noticeable differences between $\nu_x$ and $\bar\nu_x$, highlighting the limitation in 3-species treatments to study impacts of flavor conversion on neutrino signals. Our result also suggests that FFC models yield lower neutrino heating rate and smaller shock radii compared to cases with no FFC, in agreement with earlier studies employing quantum kinetic neutrino transport. This work provides valuable information towards robust implementation of FFC subgrid model into classical transport, and serves as a pilot study for future multi-dimensional simulations.
#### The initial evolution of SN 1993J: Piston phase versus standard model

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.07137

 - **Abstract**
 The evolution of SN 1993J is unlikely to be self-similar. Spatially resolved VLBI-observations show that the velocity of the outer rim of the radio emission region brakes at a few hundred days. The reason for this break remains largely unknown. It is argued here that it is due to the transition between an initial piston phase to a later phase, which is described by the standard model. The properties of the reverse shock are quite different for a piston phase as compared to the standard self-similar model. This affects the expected X-ray emission; for example, the reverse shock becomes transparent to X-ray emission much earlier in the piston phase. Furthermore, it is shown that the observed box-like emission line profiles of H_alpha and other optical lines are consistent with an origin from the transition region between the envelope and the core. It is also pointed out that identifying the observed, simultaneous breaks at approximately 3100 days in the radio and X-ray light curves with the reverse shock reaching the core, makes it possible to directly relate the mass-loss rate of the progenitor star to observables.
#### ALMA-JELLY I: High Resolution CO(2-1) Observations of Ongoing Ram Pressure Stripping in NGC 4858 Reveal Asymmetrical Gas Tail Formation and Fallback

 - **Abstract**
 We present new CO(2-1) observations (resolution $\sim1" = 460$pc) of the Coma cluster jellyfish galaxy NGC 4858 obtained from the ALMA-JELLY large program. Analyzing this data alongside complimentary Subaru H$\alpha$ and HST (F600LP / F350LP) observations, we find numerous structural and kinematic features indicative of the effects from strong, inclined ram pressure, including an asymmetric inner gas tail. We estimate a highly-inclined disk-wind angle of $\phi_{DW} = 75^{+10}_{-27}$. By subtracting a simple circular velocity model, we find (1): gas clumps that are being accelerated by ram pressure, and (2): signatures of gas clumps that had been previously pushed out of the disk but are now falling inwards. We also discuss head-tail morphologies in star complexes within the stellar disk that appear to be RPS-influenced. Lastly, we compare this galaxy to state-of-the-art galaxy ``wind tunnel'' simulations. We find that this galaxy is one of the best nearby examples of strong and inclined ram pressure gas stripping, and of gas that is perturbed by ram pressure but not fully stripped and falls back. We emphasize the importance of torques due to ram pressure in highly-inclined interactions, which help drive gas inwards on the side rotating against the wind, contributing to the formation of asymmetric inner RPS tails.

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar systems consisting of three or more stars are not an uncommon occurrence in the Galaxy. Nearly 50% of solar-type wide binaries with separations >1000 au are actually higher-order multiples with one component being a close binary. Additionally, the higher-order multiplicity fraction appears to be correlated with the physical separation of the widest component. These facts have motivated some of our current theories behind how the widest stellar systems formed, which can have separations on the order of or larger than protostellar cores. However, it is unclear if the correlation between wide binary separation and higher-order multiplicity extends to low-mass binaries. We present initial results of an ongoing speckle imaging survey of nearby low-mass wide binaries. We find an overall higher-order multiplicity fraction for our sample of $42.0\% \pm 10.9\%$. If we include systems where Gaia indicates that a companion is likely present, this fraction increases to $62.0\% \pm 14.2\%$. This is consistent with previous results from both higher-mass stars and a previous result for low-mass wide binaries. However, we do not detect the expected increase in higher-order multiplicity fraction with separation, as was seen with previous studies. We briefly explore why higher-order multiplicity statistics could be different in low-mass stars, and what the significance might be for models of wide binary formation.
#### Multi-band observation of lensed gravitational waves as a probe of small-mass dark matter halos

 - **Abstract**
 The gravitational lensing effect of gravitational waves (GWs) has been extensively discussed as a probe of small-mass dark matter halos, which can provide missing information about dark matter. We propose a multi-band observation of lensed GWs from a compact binary to observe both geometrical optics (GO) and wave optics (WO) effects from the same source. This method is expected to be advantageous in breaking parameter degeneracies between a GW source and a dark matter halo acting as a lens. We assume DECIGO or B-DECIGO as a space-based detector observing the early inspiral phase, and the ET as a ground-based detector observing the merger phase. We perform a Fisher analysis of multi-band detection for a source with masses $m_1 = 30 M_{\odot}, m_2 = 20 M_{\odot}$ at redshift $z = 1.5$, and a lens with mass $3 \times 10^{3} M_{\odot}$ at redshift $z = 1.0$. With this setup, the GO effect appears in the ET frequency band, and the WO effect in that of DECIGO. For the halo density profile, we adopt Singular Isothermal Sphere, Cored Isothermal Sphere (CIS), and Navarro-Frenk-White models. We find that multi-band observation resolves parameter degeneracies and significantly reduces errors in estimated parameters. For the CIS model, in particular, we show that, by combining ET and DECIGO observations, the lens mass error improves by about 71 $\%$ and 58 $\%$ compared to ET and DECIGO alone, respectively. Similarly, the impact parameter error is reduced by about 65 $\%$ and 70 $\%$, and the core size error by 34 $\%$ and 68 $\%$, respectively. From these results, we conclude that the multi-band observation of GWs from compact binaries improves the estimation of the lens object properties by breaking the parameter degeneracy.

 - **Abstract**
 Blue straggler stars (BSSs) are core hydrogen-burning stars routinely observed in resolved stellar systems. According to the theory of single star evolution they should not exist because, due to their large mass, they should have already evolved to stellar remnants. Hence, they are suspected to be the result of mass-enhancement processes, like mass-transfer activity in binary systems, mergers in binary or higher order systems, or direct stellar collisions, possibly mediated by dynamical interactions. Galactic globular clusters (GGCs) are templates of collisional stellar systems, where frequent gravitational interactions among stars occur on timescales shorter than their age. Thus, in these systems the number of BSSs originated by stellar collisions is expected to increase with the local stellar density and the collision rate. Here we analyse a sample of more than 3000 BSSs homogeneously observed in 48 GGCs with different structures, and we find that the number of BSSs normalized to the sampled luminosity anti-correlates (instead of correlating) with the central density, the collision rate, and the dynamical age of the parent cluster. We also find strikingly similar trends between these environmental properties and the cluster binary fraction, indicating that the latter decreases in high density/high collisional regions. We finally demonstrate that the correlations found between BSSs and the environmental parameters are explained by an underlying dependence of the BSS specific frequency on binary fraction. Once inserted in the context of the current knowledge of the BSS phenomenon, these correlations indicate that low-density regions (possibly because of a higher binary production/survival rate) are the natural habitat of both BSSs and binary systems, and the observed BSSs mostly have a binary-related origin mediated by the environmental conditions.
#### Determining the methanol deuteration in the disk around V883 Orionis with laboratory measured spectroscopy

 - **Abstract**
 Deuterium fractionation, as studied through mono-deuterated methanol, is frequently used as a diagnostic tool to trace the physical conditions and chemical evolution of interstellar sources. This study investigates methanol deuteration in the disk around V883 Ori, utilising recent laboratory spectroscopic data for CH$_2$DOH and CH$_3$OD along with ALMA observations. The derived column densities for CH$_2$DOH and CH$_3$OD are (5.14$\pm$0.08) $\times $10$^{16}$ cm$^{-2}$ and (4.22$\pm$0.06) $\times$ 10$^{16}$ cm$^{-2}$, respectively. The analysis demonstrates the influence of spectroscopic data on determining molecular column density, excitation temperature, and, most importantly, the inferred D/H ratio. The D/H ratio for CH$_2$DOH is calculated to be (7.3$\pm$1.5) $\times$ 10$^{-3}$ after applying a statistical correction, whilst the D/H ratio for CH$_3$OD is (1.79$\pm$0.36) $\times$ 10$^{-2}$. The discovery of an unexpectedly low CH$_2$DOH/CH$_3$OD ratio (1.22$\pm$0.02) in V883 Ori, however, raises further questions about the synthesis and chemical processes involved in CH$_3$OD formation. Overall, this study underscores the importance of accurate spectroscopic data for studies of isotopic fractionation and provides new insights into methanol deuteration chemistry in star-forming regions. Future research, combining updated spectroscopy and chemical modelling, will help further constrain these processes across different masses and evolutionary stages.
#### New Insights into the T Tauri Binary Separation Distribution

 - **Abstract**
 For three decades, adaptive optic surveys have revealed an excess of T Tauri binaries across a = 10-100 au in nearby star-forming regions compared to the field population of main-sequence (MS) stars. Such an excess requires that most stars are born in dense clusters and subjected to significant dynamical processing that disrupts such binaries across intermediate separations. However, we demonstrate that the apparent excess is due to an observational selection bias. Close binaries within a < 100 au clear out their dusty circumstellar disks on faster timescales compared to wide binaries and single stars. A magnitude-limited sample is therefore biased toward close binaries that have preferentially cleared out their obscuring disks. We re-examine the separation distribution of pre-MS binaries in low-density Taurus, moderately dense Upper Scorpius, and the extremely dense Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC). By limiting the samples to primary spectral type / mass instead of magnitude, the artificial excess across a = 10-100 au disappears in all three environments. Across wider separations a = 100-4,000 au, Taurus exhibits an excess of companions (mostly tertiaries), the ONC displays a deficit, and Upper Scorpius matches the field MS population. The field derives from an amalgam of all three environments, where Upper Scorpius corresponds to the average birth environment of solar-type stars. The total binary fraction within a < 10,000 au in Taurus is only 52% +/- 7%, substantially lower than the 100% inferred from the biased observations and only slightly higher than the field MS value of 45%. N-body interactions preferentially disrupt outer tertiaries with only marginal dynamical processing of the inner binaries, especially those within a < 100 au.

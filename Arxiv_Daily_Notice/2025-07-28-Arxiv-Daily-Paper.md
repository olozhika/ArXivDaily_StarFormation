 - **Abstract**
 Interstellar ices play a fundamental role in the physical and chemical evolution of molecular clouds and star-forming regions, yet their large-scale distribution and abundance remain challenging to map. In this work, I present the ice color excess method, which parametrizes the peak optical depth ($\tau_{3.0}^{\mathrm{max}}$) of the prominent 3$\mu$m absorption feature, which is predominantly caused by the presence of solid H$_2$O. The method builds on well-established near-infrared color excess techniques and uses widely available infrared broadband photometry. Through detailed evaluation of passband combinations and a comprehensive error analysis, I construct the ice color excess metric $\Lambda(W_1 - I_1)$. This parameter emerges as the optimal choice that minimizes systematic errors while leveraging high-quality, widely available photometry from Spitzer and WISE data archives. To calibrate the method, I compile from the literature a sample of stars located in the background of nearby molecular clouds, for which spectroscopically measured optical depths are available. The empirical calibration yields a remarkably tight correlation between $\tau_{3.0}^{\mathrm{max}}$ and $\Lambda(W_1 - I_1)$. This photometric technique opens a new avenue for tracing the icy component of the interstellar medium on Galactic scales, providing a powerful complement to spectroscopic surveys and enabling new insights into the environmental dependence of the formation and evolution of icy dust grains.

 - **Abstract**
 Silicate clouds are known to significantly impact the spectra of late L-type brown dwarfs, with observable absorption features at ~ 10 micron. JWST has reopened our window to the mid-infrared with unprecedented sensitivity, bringing the characterization of silicates into focus again. Using JWST, we characterize the planetary-mass brown dwarf PSO J318.5338-22.8603, concentrating on any silicate cloud absorption the object may exhibit. PSO J318's spectrum is extremely red, and its flux is variable, both of which are likely hallmarks of cloud absorption. We present JWST NIRSpec PRISM, G395H, and MIRI MRS observations from 1-18 micron. We introduce a method based on PSO J318's brightness temperature to generate a list of cloud species that are likely present in its atmosphere. We then test for their presence with petitRADTRANS retrievals. Using retrievals and grids from various climate models, we derive bulk parameters from PSO J318's spectra, which are mutually compatible. Our retrieval results point to a solar to slightly super-solar atmospheric C/O, a slightly super-solar metallicity, and a 12C/13C below ISM values. The atmospheric gravity proves difficult to constrain for both retrievals and grid models. Retrievals describing the flux of PSO J318 by mixing two 1-D models (``two-column models'') appear favored over single-column models; this is consistent with PSO J318's variability. The JWST spectra also reveal a pronounced absorption feature at 10 micron. This absorption is best reproduced by introducing a high-altitude cloud layer of small (<0.1 micron), amorphous SiO grains. The retrieved particle size and location of the cloud is consistent with SiO condensing as cloud seeding nuclei. High-altitude clouds comprised of small SiO particles have been suggested in previous studies, therefore the SiO nucleation we potentially observe in PSO J318 could be a more wide-spread phenomenon.
#### Orbital statistics of multiple systems formed from small-$N$ subclusters

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18701

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.18701

 - **Abstract**
 We use numerical $N$-body experiments to explore the statistics of multiple systems formed in small-$N$ subclusters, i.e. the distributions of orbital semi-major axis, $a$, orbital eccentricity, $e$, mass ratio, $q$, mutual orbital inclination, $\theta$, and ejection velocity, $\upsilon_{\rm ej}$. The stars in a subcluster are evolved as if they are the fragmentation products of a single isolated prestellar core from which most of the natal gas has already been dispersed, and there are no correlations between the stars' initial positions and velocities. Two parameters are particularly important: the number of stars in the subcluster, $N$, and the fraction of kinetic energy in ordered rotation, $\alpha_{\rm rot}$. Increasing $N$ has the effect of systematically decreasing the semi-major axes of the tighter orbits, but has very little effect on the semi-major axes of the wider orbits. The main effect of $\alpha_{\rm rot}$ is to regulate the distribution of mutual orbital inclinations, with $\alpha_{\rm rot}\!\sim\!0.5$ producing a distribution of orbital inclinations for triple systems which is consistent with observed values. Triples frequently form in high-inclination orbits without the assistance of von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai cycles. Our previous work demonstrated that subclusters with mass segregation, moderate rotation, and typically $N=4$ or 5 stars produced the best fit to the multiplicity statistics (proportions of singles, binaries, triples, etc.). Here we show that these parameters also reproduce the orbital statistics (distributions of orbital semi-major axis, $a$, orbital eccentricity, $e$, mass ratio, $q$, mutual orbital inclination, $\theta$, and ejection velocity, $\upsilon_{\rm ej}$). For the best-fit parameters, $21(\pm 1)\%$ of subclusters produce more than one multiple system.
#### Cosmic Rays Masquerading as Cool Cores: An Inverse-Compton Origin for Cool Core Cluster Emission

 - **Abstract**
 X-ray bright cool-core (CC) clusters contain luminous radio sources accelerating cosmic ray (CR) leptons at prodigious rates. Near the acceleration region, high-energy leptons produce synchrotron (mini)halos and sometimes observable gamma rays, but these leptons have short lifetimes and so cannot propagate far from sources without some rejuvenation. However, low-energy (~0.1-1 GeV) CRs should survive for >Gyr, potentially reaching ~100 kpc before losing energy via inverse-Compton (IC) scattering of CMB photons to keV X-ray energies, with remarkably thermal X-ray spectra. In groups/clusters, this will appear similar to relatively 'cool' gas in cluster cores (i.e. CCs). In lower-mass (e.g. Milky Way/M31) halos, analogous CR IC emission will appear as hot (super-virial) gas at outer CGM radii, explaining recent diffuse X-ray observations. We show that for plausible (radio/gamma-ray observed) lepton injection rates, the CR-IC emission could contribute significantly to the X-ray surface brightness (SB) in CCs, implying that CC gas densities may have been overestimated and alleviating the cooling flow problem. A significant IC contribution to diffuse X-ray emission in CC clusters also explains the tight correlation between the X-ray 'cooling luminosity' and AGN/cavity/jet power, because the apparent CC emission is itself driven by the radio source. Comparing observed Sunyaev Zeldovich to X-ray inferred pressures at $\ll 100$ kpc in CCs represents a clean test of this scenario, and existing data appears to favor significant CR-IC. A significant IC contribution also implies that X-ray inferred gas-phase metallicities have been underestimated in CCs, potentially explaining the discrepancy between X-ray (sub-Solar) and optical/UV (super-Solar) observed metallicities in the central ~10 kpc of nearby CCs. We also discuss the model's connection to observations of multiphase gas in clusters.
#### The infrared jet of M87 observed with JWST

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first JWST+NIRCam images of the giant elliptical active galaxy M87 and its jet at 0.90, 1.50, 2.77 and 3.56 $\mu$m. We analysed the large-scale jet structure, identifying prominent components, and determined the near-infrared spectral index. The data were calibrated using the standard JWST pipeline. We subtracted a constant background level and a smooth model of the galaxy surface brightness to isolate the jet. The total image fluxes measured in the NIRCam filters follow the infrared bump pattern seen near 1.6 $\mu$m in the spectral energy distribution of M87, caused by the surrounding stellar population in the galaxy. The residual jet images broadly agree with the radio to optical synchrotron power law $S_\lambda\propto\lambda^\alpha$ with $\alpha=$0.7-1.0. We identified the most upstream knot L at a distance of (320$\pm$50) mas from the core. The component HST-1, at (950$\pm$50) mas from the core, is transversely resolved, and both the individual images and the spectral index map clearly indicate its double-component substructure with two elements of similar size and flux density, with centroids separated by (150$\pm$20) mas and with a significantly larger spectral index $\alpha$ observed in the downstream component ($\alpha_{\rm do}=0.3$) than in the upstream one ($\alpha_{\rm up}= -0.15$). We also observe the counter-jet component located about 24 arcsec away from the nucleus.
#### Detection of CO$_2$, CO, and H$_2$O in the atmosphere of the warm sub-Saturn HAT-P-12b

 - **Abstract**
 The chemical composition of warm gas giant exoplanet atmospheres (with Teq < 1000 K) is not well known due to the lack of observational constraints. HAT-P-12 b is a warm, sub-Saturn-mass transiting exoplanet that is ideal for transmission spectroscopy. One transit of HAT-P-12 b was observed with JWST NIRSpec in the 2.87-5.10 $\mu$m range with a resolving power of $\sim$1000. The JWST data are combined with archival observations from HST WFC3 covering the 1.1-1.7 $\mu$m range. The data are analysed using two data reduction pipelines and two atmospheric retrieval tools. Atmospheric simulations using chemical forward models are performed. CO2, CO, and H2O are detected at 12.2, 4.1, and 6.0 $\sigma$ confidence, respectively. Their volume mixing ratios are consistent with an atmosphere of $\sim$10 times solar metallicity and production of CO2 by photochemistry. CH4 is not detected and seems to be lacking, which could be due to a high intrinsic temperature with strong vertical mixing or other phenomena. SO2 is also not detected and its production seems limited by low upper atmospheric temperatures ($\sim$500 K at $P<10^{-3}$ bar inferred from 1D retrievals), insufficient to produce it in detectable quantities ($\gtrsim$ 800 K required according to photochemical models). Retrievals indicate the presence of clouds between $10^{-1}$ and $10^{-3}$ bar. This study points towards an atmosphere for HAT-P-12 b that could be enriched in carbon and oxygen with respect to its host star. When including the production of CO2 via photochemistry, an atmospheric metallicity that is close to Saturn's can explain the observations. Metallicities inferred for other gas giant exoplanets based on their CO2 mixing ratios may need to account for its photochemical production pathways. This may impact studies on mass-metallicity trends and links between exoplanet atmospheres, interiors, and formation history.

 - **Abstract**
 Young exoplanets provide a critical link between understanding planet formation and atmospheric evolution. Direct imaging spectroscopy allows us to infer the properties of young, wide orbit, giant planets with high signal-to-noise. This allows us to compare this young population to exoplanets characterized with transmission spectroscopy, which has indirectly revealed the presence of clouds, photochemistry, and a diversity of atmospheric compositions. Direct detections have also been made for brown dwarfs, but direct studies of young giant planets in the mid-infrared were not possible prior to JWST. With two exoplanets around a solar type star, the YSES-1 system is an ideal laboratory for studying this early phase of exoplanet evolution. We report the first direct observations of silicate clouds in the atmosphere of the exoplanet YSES-1 c through its 9-11 micron absorption feature, and the first circumplanetary disk silicate emission around its sibling planet, YSES-1 b. The clouds of YSES-1 c are composed of either amorphous iron-enriched pyroxene or a combination of amorphous MgSiO3 and Mg2SiO4, with particle sizes of less than or equal to 0.1 micron at 1 millibar of pressure. We attribute the emission from the disk around YSES-1 b to be from submicron olivine dust grains, which may have formed through collisions of planet-forming bodies in the disk.
#### Arcsecond-Scale X-ray Imaging and Spectroscopy of SS 433 with Chandra HETG

 - **Abstract**
 We present a spatial and spectral analysis of arcsecond-scale X-ray emission in SS433 using zeroth-order data from Chandra High-Energy Transmission Grating (HETG) observations. The analysis is based on 24 observations acquired between 1999 and 2024, comprising a total exposure of $\sim$850 ks and covering a wide range of orbital and precessional phases. Among these, the $\sim$140 ks observation from 2014 was analyzed in detail for this study. This data provides the best statistics and was taken when the jets were nearly perpendicular to the line of sight and the accretion disk was eclipsed. By applying an energy-dependent subpixel event repositioning algorithm and the Richardson-Lucy deconvolution, we enhanced the spatial resolution and revealed eastern and western knot-like structures at a distance of $\sim$1.7 arcsec ($\sim 10^{17}$ cm) from the core. These features are consistent with the kinematic precession model, and the positions of the knots suggest that they were ejected approximately 200 days prior to the observation. A comparison with VLA radio data obtained at a similar precessional phase shows that the X-ray emission extends east-west on a scale comparable to that of the radio emission. While the core is bright in both X-rays and radio, the brightness contrast between the knots and the core is smaller in X-rays than in radio. Spatially resolved spectroscopy indicates that prominent Fe lines in the core X-ray spectrum are well explained by thermal plasma emission. In contrast, Fe lines are not evident in the outer regions after accounting for potential core contamination, suggesting a dominant contribution from non-thermal processes. These findings imply that the arcsecond-scale X-ray structures may vary observationally with viewing conditions or precessional phase, but likely reflect a relatively stable jet-driving mechanism operating within the SS 433 system.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a detailed study of the magnetic field structure in the G111 molecular cloud, a ring-like filamentary cloud within the NGC 7538 region. We utilized interstellar dust polarization from the Planck telescope to trace large-scale field orientations, starlight extinction polarization from the Kanata telescope to probe the cloud's magnetic field after foreground subtraction, and velocity gradients derived from CO isotopologues, observed with the IRAP 30m telescope, to examine dense regions. Our results reveal a coherent yet spatially varying magnetic field within G111. We correct the significant foreground dust contamination through careful subtraction. We observe a global alignment of the magnetic field with density structures suggesting that the field is dynamically important in shaping the cloud. The curved magnetic field along the dense regions, coinciding with mid-infrared emission in WISE data, indicates shock compression, likely driven by stellar feedback or supernova remnants. Our findings support a scenario where G111's morphology results from turbulent shock-driven compression. The interplay between magnetic fields and external forces is crucial in shaping and maintaining the structure of the molecular cloud. Future high-resolution observations will be essential to further constrain the magnetic field's role in cloud evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 The age distribution function of star clusters in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) is known to present a feature called the cluster age gap, a period of time from ~ 4 to 11 Gyr ago with a remarkable small number of clusters identified. In this work we performed an in-depth analysis of three recently catalogued age gap cluster candidates with the aim of confirming their physical nature. We used GEMINI@GMOS g,i photometry centred on the objects to build colour-magnitude diagrams from which we recognised their main features. We also performed an automatic search of stellar overdensities using Gaussian mixture model techniques and analysed the corresponding colour-magnitude diagrams similarly as performed for the aforementioned candidates. The present GEMINI data sets would seem to discard any strong evidence of these object being real clusters, and rather support the possibility of the result of stellar density variations of the LMC field star distribution. These three objects, in addition to other 17 new identified candidates, are placed in the LMC outermost disc in a limited region toward the southwest from the LMC centre. They had embraced the possibility to answer the long-time conundrum about the absence of LMC age gap clusters. From an statistical approach, combined with the knowledge of the expected LMC age-metallicity relationship, and recent simulations of the interaction between the LMC and the Milky Way, we provide not only evidence against the physical nature of the studied objects, but also an interpretation on the lack of identification of more LMC age gap clusters.
#### Triggering Electron Capture Supernovae: Dark Matter Effects in Degenerate White-Dwarf-like Cores of Super-Asymptotic Giant Branch Stars

 - **Abstract**
 Electron-capture supernovae (ECSNe) have emerged as a compelling formation channel for low-mass neutron stars, bolstered by decades of theoretical work and increasingly supported by observational evidence, including the recent identification of SN~2018zd. Motivated by this, we investigate the influence of fermionic asymmetric dark matter (ADM) on the equilibrium structure of progenitor cores and the formation of their neutron star remnants. Using a general relativistic two-fluid formalism, we model the coupled evolution of ordinary matter (OM) and ADM, treated as separately conserved fluids interacting solely through gravity. Our analysis focuses on neon-rich white dwarfs (Ne WDs), which are typical progenitor cores for ECSNe. We assume conservation of both baryon number ($N_B$) and dark matter particle number ($N_D$) during collapse, allowing for a consistent mapping between progenitor and remnant configurations. We find that ADM significantly enhances the central density of the WD progenitor. This lowers the threshold gravitational mass $M^*$ required to initiate electron capture, enabling ECSNe from lower-mass progenitors. The resulting remnants are stable, dark matter-admixed neutron stars with gravitational masses potentially well below current observational bounds. Moreover, we find that the conversion energy during the WD-to-NS conversion is also significantly reduced for higher ADM particle masses and fractions, suggesting that unusually low-energy ECSNe may serve as potential indicators of ADM involvement in stellar collapse.
#### Tracers of the ionization fraction in dense and translucent molecular gas: II. Using mm observations to constrain ionization fraction across Orion B

 - **Abstract**
 The ionization fraction ($f_\mathrm{e}=n_\mathrm{e}/n_\mathrm{H}$) is a crucial parameter of interstellar gas, yet estimating it requires deep knowledge of molecular gas chemistry and observations of specific lines, such as those from isotopologs like HCO$^+$ and N$_2$H$^+$, which are detectable only in dense cores. Previous challenges in constraining $f_\mathrm{e}$ over large areas stemmed from the limitations of observational tracers and chemical models. Recent models have identified molecular line ratios that can trace $f_\mathrm{e}$ in different environments within molecular clouds. In this study, we analyze various molecular lines in the 3-4 mm range to derive the ionization fraction across the Orion B giant molecular cloud. We focus on dense and translucent gas, exploring variations with gas density ($n$) and the far-ultraviolet (FUV) radiation field ($G_0$). Our findings show that the ionization fraction ranges from $10^{-5.5}$ to $10^{-4}$ in translucent gas and $10^{-8}$ to $10^{-6}$ in dense gas. Notably, $f_\mathrm{e}$ is sensitive to $G_0$ in dense, UV-illuminated regions, decreasing with increasing volume density ($f_\mathrm{e} \propto n^{-0.227}$ for dense and $f_\mathrm{e} \propto n^{-0.3}$ for translucent gas) and increasing with $G_0$. In translucent gas, differing line ratios yield consistent fe values, indicating the importance of electron excitation of HCN and HNC. For dense gas, we recommend using the CN(1-0)/N$_2$H$^+$(1-0) ratio for upper limits on fe and C$^{18}$O(1-0)/HCO$^+$(1-0) for lower limits. In translucent environments, CCH(1-0)/HNC(1-0) effectively traces $f_\mathrm{e}$. The higher fe values in translucent gas align with the C$^+$/CI/CO transition, while values in dense gas are adequate for coupling with the magnetic field.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a radio polarimetric study of the Boomerang pulsar wind nebula G106.65+2.96 with VLA observations at the 6 GHz band. Our high-resolution image discovers new small-scale features in the nebula, including an elliptical core of $40''\times20''$ surrounding the central pulsar and a $2'$-long arc wrapping around the core in the north. The latter shows a clear gap from the core, and it consists of a bright lobe in the northwest and a tongue-like structure in the northeast. These could be resulting from the pulsar wind interaction with the environment. Our polarization measurement reveals a highly ordered magnetic field with toroidal geometry. The small scale features are all highly linearly polarized. In particular, the lobe has a polarization fraction of $\sim$60%, close to the synchrotron limit. This is also much higher than the value measured at a lower frequency, implying significant depolarization. We show that this can be explained by Faraday rotation in the nebula, and we constructed a simple 3D model accordingly to infer a magnetic field strength of $\sim$50-105$\mu$G.
#### X-Shooting ULLYSES: Massive stars at low metallicity XIV. Properties of SMC late-O and B supergiants reveal the metallicity dependence of winds in the Magellanic Clouds

 - **Abstract**
 Considering the physics of radiation-driven winds of massive stars, the wind properties should depend on the metal content of the stellar atmosphere. Therefore, studying the winds of massive stars in different metallicities provides a sanity check on prescriptions that are widely used in evolutionary calculations. We obtained the stellar and wind properties of a sample of 20 late-O and B supergiants in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) from a quantitative combined UV and optical spectroscopic analysis using CMFGEN. By comparing these properties with those of a Large Magellanic Cloud counterpart study, which has a similar sample and data, and employed the same modelling techniques used in this study, We derived a metallicity-dependent recipe for wind momentum, which is applicable for $5.4 \leq \log{L_{\rm bol}/L_{\odot}} \leq6.1$ and $14 \leq T_{\rm eff}/{\rm kK} \leq 32$. We find a significant dependence of the wind momentum on the metallicity, which is largely due to the mass-loss rates. We do not find any evidence of a discontinuity in either the mass-loss rate or the ratio of the terminal wind velocity to the escape velocity between $25$ and $21$~kK, which could be attributed to the bi-stability jump. Stellar parameters are consistent across different methods and radiative transfer codes, whereas mass-loss rates differ significantly, with our values being generally lower. We find a discrepancy between the evolutionary and spectroscopic masses in $40\%$ of our sample, with the evolutionary mass usually being systematically higher. The mass-loss rates of blue supergiants are far too low to strip the stellar envelope and the subsequent formation of classical Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars, leading to the conclusion that luminous blue variable eruptions or binary interactions are necessary to explain the characteristics of the WR population in the SMC.

 - **Abstract**
 We compile JWST/NIRSpec prism and MIRI data for 249 Little Red Dots (LRDs) at $2.3<z<9.3$, forming a representative spectroscopic subset of NIRCam-selected LRDs. We derive a median stacked spectrum covering rest-frame 0.09-1.2 $\mu$m, with MIRI photometry extending the spectral energy distribution to 4 $\mu$m. Four additional stacks for subsamples defined by optical-to-UV luminosity ratios show that LRDs form a heterogeneous population spanning diverse continuum slopes and line properties. Assuming LRDs host super-massive black holes (BHs) surrounded by dense gas clouds, and stars accompany this core, we infer masses of $M_{BH}\sim10^{6.0-6.5}$~M$_\odot$ and $M_\bigstar\sim10^{8.3}$ M$_\odot$, corresponding to BH-to-stellar mass ratios of 1-2%. The stacks show ubiquitous UV and optical FeII emission, indicating a direct view of the broad-line region and high (but sub-Eddington) accretion ($\lambda_{Edd}=0.6\pm0.2$). We find a significant stellar contribution in the far-UV, reaching $\sim80$% in the bluest systems. Possible Wolf-Rayet features (HeII$\lambda$4687, nitrogen lines) are identified, tracing a young (3-7 Myr) compact starburst event. We also detect strong Balmer breaks and atypical Balmer, Paschen, [OIII], and optical and near-infrared HeI line ratios, and an absorption at $\sim4550$ Angstrom (probably linked to FeII), all consistent with radiative-transfer effects in high-density gas with warm temperatures (4000-7000 K). We find a diversity of LRD flavors modulated by the luminosity ratio between between a short ($\lesssim20$ Myr) and intense phase of BH activity, the most extreme stage lasting $\sim3-7$ Myr, characterized by near-Eddington-limit radiation, and a nuclear and compact starburst dominated by massive stars (even super-massive, $\mathrm{M}_\mathrm{SMS}\sim10^{5}$ M$_\odot$), all embedded in dense gas with modest dust content producing a variety of optical depths.

 - **Abstract**
 The Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) of the Milky Way is the way station that primarily controls how much gas flows from the disk of the Galaxy towards the central nucleus. While this region is well documented to have extreme gas properties that clearly distinguish it from the rest of the Galaxy, the properties of the bulk molecular gas at high angular resolution are relatively unexplored. Band 3 data from the ALMA (Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array) large program ACES (ALMA CMZ Exploration Survey) reveal the highly filamentary nature of CMZ molecular gas at high resolution (3" or 0.1pc) across the entire CMZ. Visual inspection of these data suggests that there are at least two general classes of elongated structures, which we identify as: i) large-scale (10 pc) filamentary structures (LFs) and ii) a ubiquitous population of small-scale (about 1 pc) filamentary structures (SFs). We present detailed morphological and kinematic properties towards three structures in each category, as well as their association with magnetic fields and the correlation of HNCO 4(0,4)-3(0,3) with other molecular species. Our investigation reveals that these structures are largely coherent in position-position-velocity space. The alignment with the magnetic field structure is mixed, with some parallel, some perpendicular, and some intermediate alignments. We find that LFs likely trace pieces of contiguous CMZ orbital structures and are a manifestation of global CMZ dynamics. The second class, SFs, are pervasive and may be the result of complicated turbulence and shearing dynamics in the CMZ gas flows, as seen in numerical simulations.

 - **Abstract**
 The ALMA Central molecular zone Exploration Survey (ACES) large program has observed the inner ~ 200 pc of the Milky Way at 3 mm (Band 3) using ALMA's 12m, 7m, and Total Power arrays. With an angular resolution of ~ 2", ACES provides a contiguous, multi-scale view of the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) via the dust continuum and a suite of molecular lines. We present an overview of the molecular line data processing for ACES and describe the first data release. We showcase the HNCO (4-3) and HCO$^{+}$ (1-0) data, which were targeted at high spectral resolution (0.2 km s$^{-1}$) to trace the kinematics of the molecular gas in the CMZ. The HNCO and HCO$^{+}$ maps are compared with previous single-dish CMZ surveys and discrete ALMA observations of CMZ clouds to demonstrate the quality of the data. We highlight the ubiquity of parsec-scale, linear absorption features traced by HCO$^{+}$. Their origin is unknown, and ACES provides the first opportunity to study these enigmatic features throughout the CMZ. We release the HNCO and HCO$^{+}$ cubes for all 45 ACES fields, along with the full cube mosaics which combine all fields into a contiguous mosaic of the CMZ. We additionally provide advanced products of these full mosaics, including integrated and peak intensity, noise, and position-velocity maps. These products provide substantial legacy value for the community, offering an unparalleled view of the physical and kinematic structure of the dense gas in the CMZ.

 - **Abstract**
 The Sun is observed in unprecedented detail, enabling studies of its activity on very small spatiotemporal scales. However, the large volume of data collected by our telescopes cannot be fully analyzed with conventional methods. Popular machine learning methods identify general trends from observations, but tend to overlook unusual events due to their low frequency of occurrence. We study the applicability of unsupervised probabilistic methods to efficiently identify rare events in multidimensional solar observations and optimize our computational resources to the study of these extreme phenomena. We introduce Inspectorch, an open-source framework that utilizes flow-based models: flexible density estimators capable of learning the multidimensional distribution of solar observations. Once optimized, it assigns a probability to each sample, allowing us to identify unusual events. We apply this approach by applying it to observations from the Hinode Spectro-Polarimeter, the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph, the Microlensed Hyperspectral Imager at Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope, the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory and the Extreme Ultraviolet Imager on board Solar Orbiter. We find that the algorithm assigns consistently lower probabilities to spectra that exhibit unusual features. For example, it identifies profiles with very strong Doppler shifts, uncommon broadening, and temporal dynamics associated with small-scale reconnection events, among others. As a result, Inspectorch demonstrates that density estimation using flow-based models offers a powerful approach to identifying rare events in large solar datasets. The resulting probabilistic anomaly scores allow computational resources to be focused on the most informative and physically relevant events.

 - **Abstract**
 CO$_2$ is an important, stable, and abundant molecule in the Universe, but it is very difficult to detect because it has no observable pure rotational transitions. The unique sensitivity and resolution of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) provide a fresh way to investigate it. CO$_2$ is typically found in the solid phase (ice) on grain mantles in dense molecular clouds, but is less commonly detected in the gas phase (compared to common molecules such as CO and H$_2$O) and has mostly been found in protostellar and proto-planetary environments. Here, we report and characterize the first observations of gas-phase CO$_2$ absorption toward two IR-bright regions of the Galactic Center, thanks to the high sensitivity of JWST. Using an LTE model we find a CO$_2$ gas excitation temperature between 20 and 50~K, a column density around 2$\times$10$^{15}$~cm$^{-2}$ and a radial velocity consistent with 0. We also report: 1) simultaneous detections of C$_2$H$_2$ and HCN absorption bands (near 13.7 and 14.0 $\mu$m, respectively), with column densitiy ratios of 1:3 and 3:2 with respect to gas-phase CO$_2$, and 2) CO$_2$ ice absorption with a ice-to-gas ratio of 90, consistent with previous findings. We conclude that the absorbing medium is likely in the foreground, most likely from one or more somewhat clumpy cloud(s), located between 0.15 and 4~kpc away from Earth. Additionally, we detected point-like CO$_2$ emission likely associated with a Galactic Center star (IRS~11SW), which is also spatially coincident with a previously reported X-ray source, raising the possibility that the system is a symbiotic binary.
#### Constraining the Sub-Galactic Relationship Between Star Formation and the Hot Interstellar Medium in NGC 4254

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the relationship between star formation and X-ray emission from the hot interstellar medium (ISM) on $\sim$kpc scales in NGC 4254 (M99) by combining spatially resolved star formation histories (SFHs) and Bayesian X-ray spectral fitting. We measure sub-galactic star formation rates (SFR) by modeling spectrophotometric UV-IR data with flexible SFHs, and we produce point-source-subtracted maps of the diffuse X-ray emission using Chandra data. We extract and fit the spectra of 5 regions selected by their SFR density $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$, deriving hot gas luminosities and plasma temperatures. We examine the sub-galactic $kT-\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$ and $L^{\rm gas}_X-\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$ scaling relations in NGC 4254, and compare to predictions from simple models of the feedback into the ISM from core collapse supernovae (CCSNe). The hot gas emission from NGC 4254 is consistent with thermalization of $\approx 40-50\%$ of the energy from CCSNe in the ISM, and mass-loading of the CCSNe ejecta which decreases as $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}^{-1/3}$. Our optimized model implies a temperature and X-ray production efficiency that scale as $kT = (0.72^{+0.26}_{-0.18}~{\rm keV}) \Sigma_{\rm SFR}^{0.34\pm0.10}$ and $\eta = (0.03^{+0.02}_{-0.01}) \Sigma_{\rm SFR}^{0.34\pm0.18}$, respectively, for $\Sigma_{\rm SFR} = 0.01-0.13~{\rm M_{\odot}~yr^{-1}~kpc^{-2}}$. We also compare the properties of the hot ISM to other ISM phases using data from the PHANGS program. The diffuse X-ray emission of a given region is on average 200 times fainter than the H$\alpha$ emission, and we see evidence that the hot ISM is over-pressurized compared to the large-scale dynamical equilibrium pressure of the galaxy, consistent with expansion of the hot ISM into the ambient medium.
#### ASKAP J005512.2-255834: A Luminous, Long-Lived Radio Transient at z = 0.1 -- an Orphan Afterglow or an off-nuclear TDE from an IMBH?

 - **Abstract**
 We report the discovery of a slowly evolving, extragalactic radio transient, ASKAP J005512.2--255834 (hereafter ASKAP J0055-2558), identified using the Australian SKA Pathfinder in a search for orphan afterglows associated with archival gravitational wave events. Although discovered in this context, there is no evidence that the transient is associated with any known gravitational wave event. Nonetheless, this source exhibits a 20-fold increase in flux density over $<250$ days, and it remains in a declining, detectable state more than 1000 days after the initial detection. Follow-up observations from 0.3 to 9 GHz reveal an evolving spectrum consistent with synchrotron emission. ASKAP J0055-2558 is spatially coincident with a low-mass, star-forming galaxy at redshift $z = 0.116$ ($d_{\rm L}$= 543 Mpc), placing its peak radio luminosity at $\nu L_\nu \sim 10^{39}\,\rm erg\,s^{-1}$. Analysis of its radio light curve, inferred blastwave velocity, energetics, host galaxy properties and the absence of counterparts at other wavelengths suggest that ASKAP J0055-2558 is most consistent with either the late-time phase of an orphan long gamma-ray burst afterglow or a tidal disruption event involving an intermediate-mass black hole spatially offset from the galaxy nucleus. The radio discovery of either of these phenomena is extremely rare, with only a few or no confirmed examples to date.

 - **Abstract**
 The development of models for matter infall from a collapsing molecular cloud is an essential part of numerical studies on the formation and evolution of protoplanetary disks. In this article, the widely used Nakamoto and Nakagawa (1994) model is analyzed and modifications are proposed to complement the initial model. These improvements include calculation for the outer boundary of a molecular cloud and refinement of the initial density distribution within. Also, due to the finite size of a cloud, the approach for computing the rate of mass infall onto the protoplanetary disk during collapse is modified. The proposed enhancements are aimed at eliminating the key limitations of the initial model, but do not affect its advantages, such as simplicity in numerical implementation. Using the modified model, we investigate the duration of the embedded phase of the evolution of young stellar objects and compare the modeling results with observational data. The results indicate a shorter duration of the embedded phase of the evolution of young stellar objects, especially in star-forming regions with a high amplitude of the initial density perturbation of prestellar condensation.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate how misalignment between the core angular momentum and the large-scale magnetic field affects protostellar outflows, and whether a single protostellar system can drive multiple outflow components. We perform three-dimensional nonideal magnetohydrodynamic simulations of magnetized rotating cores, focusing on the formation of a protostar, a circumstellar disk, and magnetically driven outflows. The initial angle between the core angular-momentum vector and the magnetic field is systematically varied from $0^\circ$ to $90^\circ$. All models launch a classical magnetocentrifugal disk wind (DW) roughly along the local disk normal. For large misalignment, the system also develops a spiralflow (SF) component that propagates parallel to the disk plane. In a representative model with a $60^\circ$ misalignment, the outflow transitions from a DW-dominated to an SF-dominated phase, with the SF becoming more massive and more extended than the DW, and the two components intermittently coexisting. Across the model suite, the maximum mass and size ratios of SF to DW, as well as the relative lifetimes of the two components, increase for misalignment angles $\gtrsim60^\circ$. We propose that secondary, misaligned outflows (or their fossil remnants) observed in some protostellar systems can be interpreted as the SF component, while the main bipolar outflow traces the DW from the same misaligned system.
#### SN 2024abvb: a Type Ibn/Icn supernova with evidence of helium and an extreme offset from its host galaxy

 - **Abstract**
 We present spectroscopic and photometric observations and analysis of SN 2024abvb, a peculiar transitional Type Ibn/Icn supernova located at an unusually large projected distance from its host galaxy (21.5 kpc). SN 2024abvb displays an extended rise time in the $g$- and $o$-bands (10.1 and 10.6 days respectively), followed by a linear decline in all photometric bands. Comparisons with other supernova subclasses show that the photometric and spectroscopic evolution of SN 2024abvb are distinct from Type~Ibn and Type Icn events, with a higher peak $r$-band luminosity and lower blackbody temperatures. Spectra reveal an initial blue continuum and narrow P-Cygni profiles, with C {\sc ii} $\lambda$5890 dominating in emission, persisting at late phases, and showing a rapid decline in the expansion velocity. Weak He {\sc i} $\lambda$5876 features are tentatively detected at early times. Analysis of progenitor scenarios rules out thermonuclear origins based on incompatible light curve shapes and spectral signatures. A rare massive star progenitor appears unlikely given the low local star formation rate. The most plausible origin is an ultra-stripped supernova scenario involving a binary system; this best explains the observed separation from the host, the low circumstellar material mass, the fast photometric evolution and the low nickel production, although a discrepancy in model versus observed ejecta mass remains. These results reinforce the classification of SN 2024abvb as a distinctive Type Ibn/Icn event and highlight the diversity of progenitor channels for interacting supernovae.

 - **Abstract**
 The global topology of the Universe can affect the long-range gravitational forces through the boundary conditions. To study non-trivial topologies in detail, simulations that natively adopt such geometries are required. Cosmological $N$-body simulations typically evolve matter in a periodic cubic box. While numerically convenient, this imposes a non-trivial 3-torus topology that affects long-range gravitational forces, potentially biasing large-scale statistics. We introduce a compactified simulation framework that is only periodic along a single axis, while having infinite topology with isotropic boundary conditions towards the perpendicular directions, i.e. an $\mathrm{S}^1\times\mathbb{R}^2$ ("slab") topology. This new simulation geometry is ideal for simulating systems with cylindrical symmetries like filaments or certain anisotropic cosmological models. We compactify comoving space via inverse stereographic projection along the radial direction of a periodic cylinder, and evolve particles with Newtonian dynamics. A smoothly varying spatial and mass resolution with radius suppresses edge artefacts at the free outer boundary. Our implementation in the StePS (STEreographically Projected cosmological Simulations) framework uses a direct $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ force calculation that maps efficiently to GPUs, and Octree $\mathcal{O}(N \log N)$ force calculation that can be used on large CPU-clusters. The cylindrical domain's topology enables fully self-consistent simulations in the $\mathrm{S}^1\times\mathbb{R}^2$ manifold and mitigates periodic-image artefacts for targets whose symmetries are mismatched to a cubic box. The main trade-off is radially varying resolution with distinct systematics and analysis requirements. We demonstrate the accuracy of the new simulation method in a standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmological simulation.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent JWST observations of HII regions in the Central Molecular Zone have shown a highly filamentary morphology distinct from HII regions in other parts of the galaxy. We present magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of strongly magnetized (plasma-$\beta$ << 1) HII region evolution that investigate and describe the formation of these ionized gas filaments. HII region evolution has been simulated in a 30 pc$^3$ box, in distinct models with pre-placed overdensities in the ambient medium and overdensities that have been generated with driven turbulence. We find that when these overdensities are seeded in the ambient medium before the birth of the ionizing source, the photoionized plasma stripped off of these dense blobs is funneled into long filaments along the magnetic field lines. The length and emission measure of these ionized gas filaments are similar to the filaments observed in the Central Molecular Zone. Given that these filaments are effectively magnetically-confined flows of photoionized gas, their density and curvature are influenced by the density of the blob and the geometry of the configuration.

 - **Abstract**
 Carbon disulfide (CS$_2$) is one of the sulfur-bearing species expected to be present in the interstellar medium (ISM). In this study, we investigated the surface reactions of solid CS$_2$ with hydrogen (H) atoms on amorphous solid water (ASW) using laboratory experiments supported by computational calculations. Our results show that CS$_2$ reacts with H atoms through quantum tunneling in the initial step, followed by successive H addition reactions, with or without activation barriers, on icy surfaces. These processes lead to the formation of several sulfur-bearing species, including hydrogen sulfide (H$_2$S), methyl mercaptan (CH$_3$SH), and small amounts of dithioformic acid (HC(S)SH) and methanedithiol (CH$_2$(SH)$_2$). The observed reactivity of CS$_2$ with H atoms provides a plausible explanation for the non-detection of CS$_2$ in interstellar ices. Furthermore, the efficient hydrogenation of the complex molecules derived from CS$_2$, namely HC(S)SH and CH$_2$(SH)$_2$, suggests that these species could be easily undergone with H atoms to produce other S-bearing species under ISM conditions.

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmic rays (CRs) are known to play a key role in many astrophysical environments: they can modify shock dynamics, influence the thermochemistry and the ionization of the interstellar medium, regulate galaxy mass content by driving galactic winds, and be released by jets from active galactic nuclei. They also serve as important observational tracers through $\gamma$-ray emission, radio synchrotron, and secondary particle production. Since CR particles follow power-law distributions in momentum space spanning many decades in energy, and because diffusion and radiative losses further shape these spectra, it is crucial to model spectrally resolved CRs in numerical simulations and to assess the impact of this modeling on gas dynamics and observational signatures. We present a consistent multi-group spectral method in momentum space for CR protons called RAMSES-MCR in the adaptive mesh refinement code RAMSES, based on the two-moment formalism that evolves both CR energy and number density in momentum space, together with their associated flux. The modeled CR processes include advection, anisotropic/isotropic diffusion, streaming instability, Coulomb and hadronic losses, adiabatic changes, and feedback onto the gas. We also show that the method can be naturally extended to CR electrons (e.g. including synchrotron losses) and generalized to multiple CR species. The implementation is validated against a suite of standard multi-dimensional tests. We finally apply RAMSES-MCR to the three-dimensional expansion of a supernova remnant including CRs with anisotropic diffusion and energy losses, and demonstrate how CR energy redistributes in a momentum-dependent manner and modifies the gas momentum during the snowplough phase.

 - **Abstract**
 RR Lyrae stars are a common, dependable Population II distance indicator, and provide an independent tracer of early star formation. Here, we utilize archival HST/ACS and JWST/NIRCam observations of the nearby dwarf star-forming galaxy WLM to study RR Lyrae in JWST filters. We independently identify RR Lyrae in HST and JWST imaging in order to evaluate JWST's efficacy at characterizing RR Lyrae in the near-IR. We use an MCMC template-fitting technique to obtain periods, amplitudes, and mean magnitudes from the RR Lyrae time-series data. The spatially overlapping HST and JWST observations allow us to directly compare the same sources observed with the instruments, and calibrate the NIRCam F090W and F150W RR Lyrae period-Wesenheit-metallicity (PWZ) relation to the Gaia-consistent HST PWZ. We additionally assess the epoch-to-epoch consistency of NIRCam photometry, and find evidence of burn-in. We conclude that the zero-point offset is negligible compared to the uncertainties from the template fitting. We conduct an MCMC fit of the PWZ with both HST and JWST data. Our results are three-fold. First, we find that we can reliably identify RR Lyrae in NIRCam data, but light-curve template fitting proves difficult on short-baseline observations. Second, the HST PWZ fit yields a distance modulus to WLM of $\mu = 24.85\pm0.05$ ($0.93\pm0.02$ Mpc). This is closer than previous measurements, primarily attributed to consistency with the Gaia scale. Lastly, although the JWST PWZ fit has large uncertainties and a poorly-constrained slope, it represents a first-of-its-kind PWZ calibration in NIRCam filters.

 - **Abstract**
 We seek to quantify the fidelity with which modern population syntheses reproduce observations in view of their use as predictive tools. We compared synthetic populations from the Generation 3 Bern Model of Planet Formation and Evolution (core accretion, solar-type host stars) and the HARPS/Coralie radial velocity sample. We biased the synthetic planet population according to the completeness of the observed data and performed quantitative statistical comparisons and systematically identified agreements and differences. Our nominal population reproduces many of the main features of the HARPS planets: two main groups of planets (close-in sub-Neptunes and distant giants), a bimodal mass function with a less populated `desert', an observed mean multiplicity of about 1.6, and several key correlations. The remaining discrepancies point to areas that are not fully captured in the model. For instance, we find that the synthetic population has 1) in absolute terms too many planets by ~70%, 2) a `desert' that is too deep by ~60%, 3) a relative excess of giant planets by ~40%, 4) planet eccentricities that are on average too low by a factor of about two (median of 0.07 versus 0.15), and 5) a metallicity effect that is too weak. Finally, the synthetic planets are overall too close to the star compared to the HARPS sample. The differences allowed us to find model parameters that better reproduce the observed planet masses, for which we computed additional synthetic populations. We find that physical processes appear to be missing and that planets may originate on wider orbits than our model predicts. Mechanisms leading to higher eccentricities and slower disc-limited gas accretion also seem necessary. We advocate that theoretical models should make a quantitative comparison between the many current and future large surveys to better understand the origins of planetary systems. (Abridged.)
#### Laplace-Fourier linear stability analysis of non-relativistic magnetized rotational jets: mode identification by Hamiltonian analysis and the occurrence of mode transitions

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we conduct a linear stability analysis of magnetized and/or rotating jets propagating in ambient matter that is also magnetized and/or rotating, having in mind the application to the jet penetrating the core/envelope of a massive star. We solve the linearized magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) equations in the non-relativistic regime by Laplace transform in time and Fourier transform in space. In this formulation all unstable modes with the same translational and azimuthal wave numbers can be obtained simultaneously by searching for pole singularities in the complex plane. In order to determine unambiguously their driving mechanisms, we evaluate the second-order perturbation of the MHD Hamiltonian for individual eigenfunctions derived at these singular points. We identify in our non-rotating models the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI) as one of the shear-driven modes and the current-driven instability such as the kink instability (KKI). In rotational models we also find the magnetorotational instability (MRI) as another shear-driven mode. In some cases, we find that a mode changes its character continuously from KKI to KHI (and vice versa) or from MRI to KHI as the jet velocity is increased.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the aftermath of a giant quiescent solar filament eruption on December 24, 2023. One feature of the eruption is an extensive fan above the filament channel that is about three times as wide as similar structures that appear above active regions (ARs) during solar flares. The fan contains numerous supra-arcade downflows (SADs), and we investigate the largest SADs with continuous Hinode X-ray Telescope (XRT) observations. The measured maximum width of the SADs in this event is at least three times the maximum width of SADs observed in AR flares, whereas the velocities of the largest SADs are similar to the typical values of AR SADs. The kinetic characteristics of the largest SADs observed in this event align with previous model predictions, where SADs originate from the non-linear development of Rayleigh-Taylor type instabilities. In this scenario, the larger system size allows the existence of larger-scale instabilities, while the development of the velocities of these instabilities is expected to be independent of the system size. Compared to AR flares, the temperature and emission measure in this event are lower, and there is less overall radiation, resulting in no evident Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) signature. Similar to those in AR flares, SADs show lower temperatures compared to the surrounding fan plasma. Our observations show that SADs are present in a wide variety of eruptions. The reconnection mechanisms present in quiescent filament eruptions are similar to those driving more compact eruptions originating from ARs.
#### An intense geomagnetic storm originated from stealth Coronal Mass Ejection: remote and $in situ$ observations by near radially aligned spacecraft

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.10090

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the solar origin and heliospheric evolution of an intense geomagnetic storm that occurred on March 23-24, 2023. Despite multiple candidate CMEs observed between March 19-21, a weak CME detected on March 19 at 18:00 UT was identified as the cause, originating from the eruption of a longitudinal-filament channel near center of the sun. The channel underwent a smooth transition to eruption phase without detectable low coronal signatures. Wide-angle heliospheric imaging revealed asymmetric expansion and acceleration by solar wind drag, achieving an average CME velocity of $\approx$640 km/s. The radial evolution of the interplanetary coronal mass ejection (ICME) was analyzed by three spacecraft in close radial alignment. Arrival times and propagation speeds were consistent across spacecraft, with a 21 hour delay between STEREO-A and WIND attributed to solar rotation and longitudinal separation. The ICME exhibits magnetic cloud (MC) signatures characterized by right-handed helicity, enhanced density at all three spacecraft. The MC underwent expansion (radial-size increases from 0.08AU at SolO to 0.18AU at STEREO-A), decrease in magnetic field strength with distance; $B_{av}\propto R_H^{-1.97}$ (SolO-STA) and $B_{av}\propto R_H^{-1.53}$ (SolO-WIND). The MC axis is inclined with the ecliptic at $-69^o$ at SolO, $-25^o$ at STA and $-34^o$ at WIND, indicating rotation during heliospheric transit. Importantly, the storm's main phase leads to a peak intensity ($SYM-H=-169$nT) occurring at 24/02:40UT followed by a second peak ($SYM-H=-170$nT) at 24/05:20UT due to density enhancement towards MC's tail. The study emphasizes the significant geoeffectiveness of weak, stealth CMEs with southward Bz and density enhancements.

 - **Abstract**
 The main accretion phase of protostars is characterized by the ejection of material in the form of jets/outflows. External UV irradiation can potentially have a significant impact on the excitation conditions within these outflows. High-resolution observations in the mid-infrared allow us to investigate the details of those energetic processes through the emission of shock-excited H$_2$ . Our aim is to spatially resolve H$_2$ and ionic/atomic emission within the outflows of low-mass protostars, and investigate its origin in connection to shocks influenced by external ultraviolet irradiation. We analyze spectral maps of 5 Class I protostars in the Ophiuchus molecular cloud from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) Medium Resolution Spectrometer (MIRI/MRS). Four out of five protostars show strong H$_2$, [\ion{Ne}{II}], and [\ion{Fe}{II}] emission associated with outflows/jets. Pure rotational H$_2$ transitions from S(1) to S(8) are found and show two distinct temperature components on Boltzmann diagrams with rotational temperatures of $\sim$500-600 K and $\sim$1000-3000 K respectively. Both $C$-type shocks propagating at high pre-shock densities (n$_\text{H} \ge$10$^4$ cm$^{-3}$) and $J$-type shocks at low pre-shock densities (n$_\text{H} \le$10$^3$ cm$^{-3}$) reproduce the observed line ratios. However, only $C$-type shocks produce sufficiently high column densities of H$_2$, whereas predictions from a single $J$-type shock reproduce the observed rotational temperatures of the gas better. A combination of various types of shocks could play a role in protostellar outflows as long as UV irradiation is included in the models. The origin of this radiation is likely internal, since no significant differences in the excitation conditions of outflows are seen at various locations in the cloud.

 - **Abstract**
 There is a long-standing discussion in the astrophysical/astrochemical community as to the structure and morphology of dust grains in various astrophysical environments (e.g., interstellar clouds, protostellar envelopes, protoplanetary and debris disks, and the atmospheres of exoplanets). Typical grain models assume a compact dust core which becomes covered in a thick ice mantle in cold dense environments. In contrast, less compact cores are likely to exhibit porosity, leading to a pronounced increase in surface area with concomitant much thinner ice films and higher accessibility to the bare grain surface. Several laboratory experimental and theoretical studies have shown that this type of dust structure can have a marked effect on several physico-chemical processes, including adsorption, desorption, mobility, and reactivity of chemical species. Porous grains are thus thought to likely play a particularly important and wide-ranging astrochemical role. Herein, we clarify what is meant by porosity in relation to grains and grain agglomerates, assess the likely astrochemical effects of porosity and ask whether a fractal/porous structural/morphological description of dust grains is appropriate from an astronomical perspective. We provide evidence for high porosity from laboratory experiments and computational simulations of grains and their growth in various astrophysical environments. Finally, we assess the observational constraints and perspectives on cosmic dust porosity. Overall, our paper discusses the effects of including porosity in dust models and the need to use such models for future astrophysical, astrochemical and astrobiological studies involving surface or solid-state processes.
#### Can a gamma-ray dim radio blazar produce a 200-PeV neutrino? The case of PMN J0606$-$0724 and KM3-230213A

 - **Abstract**
 An extremely energetic muon has been recently detected by the Cubic Kilometre Neutrino Telescope (KM3NeT), indicating the observation of a neutrino with the estimated energy of $\left( 2.2^{+5.7}_{-1.0} \right)\times 10^{17}$~eV. Radio blazar PMN~J0606$-$0724, not detected in gamma rays, is located within the reported error region of the neutrino arrival direction, and was flaring at the time of the event. Here we demonstrate that the neutrino could be produced in a photohadronic interaction in its radio core. The necessary proton power is of order of the source's photon luminosity, and protons can be accelerated to the required energies in the core, while high-energy gamma rays cannot leave the source because of intense production of electron-positron pairs. Expected contribution of the population of similar flaring sources matches non-observation of energetic events by other neutrino telescopes.

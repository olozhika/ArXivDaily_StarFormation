#### Resonant Scattering of the He I 1.0833$μ$m Triplet in H II Regions: Emission Spectra
 - **Authors:** B.T. Draine

 - **Abstract**
 Resonant scattering of He I 1.0833$\mu$m triplet photons by metastable He 2 $^3$S$_1$ is studied for optical depths characteristic of H II regions. Regions with large He 2 $^3$S$_1$ column densities are predicted to have unusually broad, multi-peaked 1.0833$\mu$m emission profiles, with the centroid blue-shifted by up to $\sim$14 km/s relative to other lines. The feature FWHM can exceed 100 km/s for some regions. Resonant trapping enhances dust absorption and reduces the He I 1.0833$\mu$m emission. Care must be taken when using the He I 1.0833$\mu$m/H I 1.0941$\mu$m (Pa$\gamma$) ratio to estimate the He$^+$/H$^+$ ratio. Predicted spectra are computed for examples, including M-17B and NGC3603 in the Galaxy, and a star-forming region in M51. Observations of the 1.0833$\mu$m triplet with spectrometers such as NIRSPEC, CARMENES, or X-Shooter can confirm the predicted effects of resonant scattering in H II regions, and constrain the nebular conditions.

 - **Abstract**
 The chemistry of shielded molecular gas is primarily driven by energetic, charged particles dubbed cosmic rays (CRs), in particular those with energies under 1 GeV. CRs ionize molecular hydrogen and helium, the latter of which contributes greatly to the destruction of molecules. CR ionization initiates a wide range of gas-phase chemistry, including pathways important for the so-called "carbon cycle", C$^+$/C/CO. Therefore, the CR ionization rate, $\zeta$, is fundamental in theoretical and observational astrochemistry. Although observational methods show a wide range of ionization rates -- varying with the environment, especially decreasing into dense clouds -- astrochemical models often assume a constant rate. To address this limitation, we employ a post-processed gas-phase chemical model of a simulated dense molecular cloud that incorporates CR energy losses within the cloud. This approach allows us to investigate changes in abundance profiles of important chemical tracers and gas temperature. Furthermore, we analyze analytical calibrators for estimating $\zeta$ in dense molecular gas that are robust when tested against a full chemical network. Additionally, we provide improved estimations of the electron fraction in dense gas for better consistency with observational data and theoretical calibrations for UV-shielded regions.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent research raises the possibility that 3 and 7 million years ago, the Sun encountered massive clouds that shrank the heliosphere--the solar cocoon protecting our solar system--exposing Earth to its interstellar environment, in agreement with geological evidence from 60Fe and 244Pu isotopes. Here we show that during such encounters Earth was exposed to increased radiation in the form of high-energy particles. During periods of Earth's immersion in the heliosphere, it received particle radiation that we name Heliospheric Energetic Particles (HEPs). The intensity of < 10 MeV protons was at least an order of magnitude more intense than today's most extreme solar energetic particle (SEP) events. SEPs today last minutes to hours, but HEP exposure then lasted for extensive periods of several months, making it a prolonged external driver. During Earth's excursion outside the heliosphere, it was exposed to a galactic cosmic ray radiation with the intensity of < 1 GeV protons at least an order of magnitude more intense than today. Therefore, the space surrounding Earth was permeated by a variable high-energy radiation. We discuss the implications for Earth's climate and biodiversity.
#### On the role of gravity, turbulence, and the magnetic field in angular momentum transfer within molecular clouds

 - **Abstract**
 Observations of molecular structures on scales of $\sim 0.1-50$ pc show that the specific angular momentum ($j$) scales with radius ($R$) as $j\sim R^{3/2}$. We study the effects of turbulence, gravity, and the magnetic field in shaping this scaling, by measuring clump size and specific angular momentum in three SPH simulations of the formation of giant molecular clouds, progressively adding these three ingredients. In each simulation, we define ``full'' and ``reduced'' clump samples, the latter restricted to aspect ratios $A<3$. We find that, in the non-magnetic runs, elongated clumps deviate the most from the \jR\ relation, which is best reproduced by the reduced sample in the gravity+turbulence run. In the purely hydrodynamic case, no dense elongated structures form, suggesting that turbulence alone is insufficient to generate dense filaments, although clumps have $j$ magnitudes consistent with observations. In the gravity+turbulence+magnetic field run, most of the clumps are filamentary, yet the full sample appears to follow the observed \jR\ relation. This result, rather than being a real trend, could be the combination of the increase in $j$ by the filamentary geometry, and its reduction by turbulence inhibition by the magnetic field. Finally, we measure the gravitational, magnetic, pressure-gradient, and hydrodynamic torques (which involve turbulent viscosity) in our clump samples. We find that, in magnitude, the hydrodynamic torques tend to be larger than the rest. This result is consistent with our previous work, where we proposed that gravity drives cloud formation and contraction, while turbulence redistributes angular momentum through fluid-parcel exchanges.
#### Template-free search for gravitational wave events using coincident anomaly detection

 - **Abstract**
 Gravitational-wave (GW) observatories have used template-based search to detect hundreds of compact binary coalescences (CBCs). However, template-based search cannot detect astrophysical sources that lack accurate waveform models, including core-collapse supernovae, neutron star glitches, and cosmic strings. Here, we present a novel approach for template-free search using coincident anomaly detection (CoAD). CoAD requires neither labeled training examples nor background-only training sets, instead exploiting the coincidence of events across spatially separated detectors as the training loss itself: two neural networks independently analyze data from each detector and are trained to maximize coincident predictions. Additionally, we show that integrated gradient analysis can localize GW signals from the neural-network weights, providing a path toward data-driven template construction of unmodeled sources, and further improving precision by frequency matching. Using the CodaBench dataset of real LIGO backgrounds with injected simulated CBCs and sine-Gaussian low-frequency bursts, CoAD achieves recall up to 0.91 and 0.85 respectively at a false-alarm rate of one event per year, and achieves recall above 0.5 at signal-to-noise ratios below 10. The fully-unsupervised nature of CoAD makes it especially well-suited for next-generation detectors with greater sensitivity and associated increases in GW event rates.

 - **Abstract**
 Herbig Ae/Be stars (HAeBes) are critical tracers of intermediate- and high-mass star formation, yet their census remains incomplete compared to low-mass young stellar objects like T-Tauri stars. To expand the known population, we systematically searched for HAeBes in LAMOST DR7 low-resolution spectra. Following Sun et al., we applied Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) for dimensionality reduction and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification, identifying $\sim$240,000 spectra with potential H$\alpha$ emission. After removing contaminants (non-stellar objects, extragalactic sources, CVs, and Algol systems) and restricting to B/A-type stars, we obtained 1,835 candidates through 2MASS/WISE visual inspection. Spectral energy distribution analysis confirmed 143 sources with infrared excess ($J$-band or longer wavelengths), including 92 known HAeBes. From the remaining 51 candidates, we classified 26 with strong infrared excess as new HAeBes. Color-index analysis of confirmed HAeBes and classical Ae/Be stars (CAeBes) revealed that the $(K-W1)_0$ vs. $(W2-W3)_0$ diagram effectively separates these populations: CAeBes predominantly occupy $(K-W1)_0 \leq 0.5$ and $(W2-W3)_0 \leq 1.1$, while other regions trace transition disks ($(K-W1)_0 < 0.5$ and $(W2-W3)_0 > 1.1$), globally depleted disks ($(K-W1)_0 > 0.5$ and $(W2-W3)_0 < 1.1$), and Class I/Flat/II HAeBes ($(K-W1)_0 > 0.5$ and $(W2-W3)_0 > 1.1$). More importantly, the HAeBes exhibit a clear evolutionary gradient on this diagram, with those in the Class III, Class II, Flat-SED, and Class I evolutionary stages being effectively distinguished by concentric ellipses that are roughly centered at (0,0) with semi-major axes of $a$=1.5, $a$=3.0, and $a$=4.0, and a semi-major to semi-minor axis ratio of 1.6:1.

 - **Abstract**
 In the core accretion scenario, forming planets start to acquire gaseous envelopes while accreting solids. Conventional one-dimensional models assume envelopes to be static and isolated. However, recent three-dimensional simulations demonstrate dynamic gas exchange from the envelope to the surrounding disk. This process is controlled by the balance between heating, through the accretion of solids, and cooling, which is regulated by poorly-known opacities. In this work, we systemically investigate a wide range of cooling and heating rates, using three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations. We identify three distinct cooling regimes. Fast-cooling envelopes ($\beta \lesssim 1$, with $\beta$ the cooling time in units of orbital time) are nearly isothermal and have inner radiative layers that are shielded from recycling flows. In contrast, slow cooling envelopes ($\beta\gtrsim10^3$) become fully convective. In the intermediate regime ($1\lesssim\beta\lesssim300$), envelopes are characterized by a three-layer structure, comprising an inner convective, a middle radiative, and an outer recycling layer. The development of this radiative layer traps small dust and vapour released from sublimated species. In contrast, fully convective envelopes efficiently exchange material from inner to outer envelope. Such fully convective envelopes are likely to emerge in the inner parts of protoplanetary disks ($\lesssim$ 1 au) where cooling times are long, implying that inner-disk super-Earths may see their growth stalled and be volatile depleted.

 - **Abstract**
 Supernovae are observed to occur approximately 1-2 times per century in a galaxy like the Milky Way. Based on historical records, however, the last core-collapse galactic supernova observed by humans occurred almost 1,000 years ago. Luckily, we are well positioned to catch the next one with the advent of new neutrino detectors and astronomical observatories. Neutrino observatories can provide unprecedented triggers for a galactic supernova event as they are likely to see a supernova neutrino signal anywhere from minutes to days before the shock breakout causes the supernova to brighten in optical wavelengths. Given its large etendue, the Vera C. Rubin Observatory is ideally positioned to rapidly localize the optical counterpart based on the neutrino trigger. In this paper we simulate events to study the efficiency with which supernovae are optimally localized by the Vera C. Rubin Observatory. We find that the observatory is ideal for initial localization of nearly all observable supernova triggers and has a 57-97% chance of catching any supernova based on theoretical stellar mass density predictions and observations. We provide an analysis of optimal filter selection and exposure times and discuss observational caveats.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the circumstellar environment of the O-type bloated star candidate IRAS 19520+2759 (I19520) using high-resolution observations from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) and the Expanded Very Large Array (EVLA). Radio continuum emission traced by the EVLA (C, K, and Q bands) exhibits a spectral index of 0.5, consistent with a thermal jet. ALMA 1.3 mm continuum map reveals a compact source coincident with the optical counterpart of I19520, likely tracing the dense core hosting the central massive young stellar object. A prominent molecular outflow in the east-west direction, along with a possible secondary outflow oriented northeast-southwest, is identified in the $^{13}\mathrm{CO}$ emission. A hot molecular core and a Keplerian disk are detected in several $\mathrm{SO}_2$ transitions. Assuming an edge-on disk geometry, the dynamical mass of the central object is estimated to be in the range of $10$-$15~M_\odot$.

 - **Abstract**
 The radius valley,a deficit of planets near 2 $\mathrm{R_{\oplus}}$, was observed among exoplanets of radius $\lesssim$ 5 $\mathrm{R_{\oplus}}$ with periods $<$ 100 days by NASA's $Kepler$ mission. It separates super-Earths (rocky, $\lesssim 1.9$ $\mathrm{R_{\oplus}}$) from sub-Neptunes (volatile-rich, $\gtrsim 2$ $\mathrm{R_{\oplus}}$) and may arise from formation conditions or atmospheric loss. Disentangling these mechanisms has led to numerous studies of population-level trends, although the resulting interpretations remain sensitive to sample selection and the robustness of host-star parameters. We re-examine its existence, depth, and dependence on period, flux, stellar mass, and age. Using SWEET-Cat and MAISTEP tool, we derived stellar parameters for 1,221 main-sequence stars (1,405 planets), with effective temperatures 4400--7500 K and radii 0.62--2.75 $\mathrm{R_{\odot}}$, achieving 2\% precision in radius and mass. Planetary radii were recomputed from radius ratios, yielding 5\% median uncertainty. The valley is partially filled near 2 $\mathrm{R_{\oplus}}$ and depends on period, flux, and stellar mass, with slopes $-0.12^{+0.02}_{-0.01}$, $0.10^{+0.02}_{-0.03}$, and $0.19^{+0.09}_{-0.07}$. Sub-Neptunes show a stronger stellar mass-dependent trend than super-Earths ($0.17^{+0.04}_{-0.04}$ vs $0.11^{+0.05}_{-0.05}$). With stellar age, the super-Earth/sub-Neptune ratio rises from $0.51^{+0.11}_{-0.08}$ ($<3$ Gyr) to $0.64^{+0.11}_{-0.11}$ ($\gtrsim3$ Gyr), and the valley becomes shallower and shifts to larger radii. A 4D fit shows consistent slopes with 2D analyses and a weaker age trend ($0.07^{+0.03}_{-0.04}$). These results suggest prolonged atmospheric loss, which is consistent with a core-powered mass loss scenario and emphasize the need for improved determinations, a goal expected to be achieved by future missions like PLATO.
#### Probing Circumstellar Material and Shock Acceleration in Core-Collapse Supernovae with High-Energy Neutrinos

 - **Abstract**
 We study high-energy (HE) neutrino production from interactions between supernova (SN) ejecta and the surrounding circumstellar material (CSM), focusing on regular Type~II and Type~IIn SNe. Using observationally inferred CSM density distributions, we calculate the resulting neutrino fluxes and examine their dependence on key parameters, including the CSM density normalization $D_*$, outer radius $R_{\rm csm}$, proton acceleration efficiency $\epsilon_p$, and magnetic energy fraction $\epsilon_B$. Detection prospects are assessed with a binned likelihood analysis for IceCube, indicating that nearby SNe with moderately dense, confined CSM can produce detectable signals, with a typical detection horizon of $\sim 0.1$ - 1 Mpc. For a Galactic SN at $\sim 10$ kpc, high-statistics neutrino data with detailed temporal and spectral information can constrain $D_*$, $R_{\rm csm}$, and $\epsilon_p$ to within a factor of $\sim 10$ or to a precision of $\sim 20\%$, depending on the assumed values of $D_*$ and $R_{\rm csm}$. These neutrino signals thus provide a complementary probe of the CSM profile and shock acceleration, alongside traditional electromagnetic observations.
#### A long-term multiwavelength study of the flat spectrum radio quasar OP 313

 - **Abstract**
 The Flat Spectrum Radio Quasar OP 313 is a high-redshift (z = 0.997) blazar that entered an intense gamma-ray active phase from November 2023 to March 2024, as observed by the Large Area Telescope (LAT) on board the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope. We present a multiwavelength analysis covering 15 years of data, from August 2008 to March 2024, to contextualize this period of extreme gamma-ray activity within the long-term emission of the source. We analyzed a long-term, comprehensive, multiwavelength dataset from different facilities and projects from radio to gamma-rays. We identified the 7 most intense gamma-ray flaring periods and performed a kinematic analysis of Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) data to determine whether new jet components emerged before or during these flares. For 2 of these flaring periods, we performed the modeling of the spectral energy distribution (SED). The VLBA-BU-BLAZAR and MOJAVE datasets reveal a new jet component appearing in both visibility datasets prior to the onset of one of the strongest gamma-ray flares. By comparing the timing of the VLBA-BU-BLAZAR knots ejection with the gamma-ray flaring periods, we constrained the setup of the SED modeling. We also found that the first gamma-ray flaring period is less Compton-dominated than the others. Our results suggest that the recent activity of OP 313 is triggered by new jet components emerging from the core and interacting with a standing shock. The {\gamma}-ray emission likely arises from dusty torus photons upscattered via Inverse Compton (IC) by relativistic jet electrons. The SED modeling indicates that this component is less dominant during the first {\gamma}-ray flaring period than the later ones.

 - **Abstract**
 Intervals of enhanced turbulent fluctuations are typically less frequent within the magnetic cloud region of an interplanetary coronal mass ejection (ICME). We investigate two such intervals inside an ICME observed by the \textit{Wind} spacecraft on 8--9 June 2000 and characterize their associated wave populations. We focus on spectral analysis and plasma instability analysis, using ion-scale normalized magnetic helicity and polarization properties with respect to the background magnetic field $B_0$. In the first interval, the ion-scale normalized magnetic helicity shows a left-handed circularly polarized signature. In the second interval, the left-handed signature persists and an additional high-frequency right-handed population appears. The propagation is approximately parallel to $B_0$. The left-handed fluctuations are compatible with Alfvén ion-cyclotron (AIC) waves, while the right-handed fluctuations are consistent with fast magnetosonic/whistler (FM/W) waves. The ICME plasma accesses resonance conditions that support multiple ion-scale wave modes. Evolving anisotropies in the plasma and the approach to marginal stability allow the coexistence of AIC-like and fast-magnetosonic/whistler-like fluctuations, with enhanced electron heating favoring the growth of the FM/W contribution and strengthening the density--magnetic-field magnitude correlation.

 - **Abstract**
 The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) offers exceptional spectral resolution and wavelength coverage, which are essential for studying the coldest brown dwarfs, particularly Y dwarfs. These objects are at the cold end of the sub-stellar sequence and exhibit atmospheric phenomena such as cloud formation, chemical disequilibrium, and radiative-convective coupling. We examine a curated sample of 22 late-T to Y dwarfs through Bayesian atmospheric retrieval (nested sampling) and supervised machine learning (random forests). Bayesian model comparison indicates that cloud-free models are generally favored for the hottest objects in the sample (T6-T8). Conversely, later-type dwarfs exhibit varying preferences, with both gray-cloud and cloud-free models providing comparable fits. The atmospheric parameters retrieved are consistent across the applied methodologies. Evidence of vertical mixing and disequilibrium chemistry is found in several objects; notably, the Y1 dwarf WISEPAJ1541-22 favors a gray cloud model and shows elevated abundances of both CO and CO2 compared to equilibrium chemistry calculations. As anticipated, the abundances of H2O, CH4, and NH3 increase with decreasing effective temperature over the T-Y sequence.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first systematic spectroscopic observations of extragalactic transients from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), as part of the DESI Transients Survey program. With 5,000 fibers and an ${\sim} 8$ deg$^2$ field of view, we exploit DESI as a machine for the discovery and classification of transients. We present transient classifications from archival DESI data in Data Releases 1 and 2, relying on a combination of a secondary target program and serendipitous observations. We also present observations from the first 6 months of the DESI spare fiber program dedicated to transients. The program is run in coordination with a dedicated DECam time-domain survey, serving as a pathfinder for what we will be able to achieve in conjunction with the Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). We classify over 250 transients, of which the majority were previously unclassified. The sample comprises thermonuclear and core-collapse supernovae and tidal disruption events (TDEs), including a TDE observed before its discovery in imaging. We demonstrate DESI's ability to classify a population of faint transients down to $r\sim 22.5$ mag during main survey operations, with negligible impacts on DESI's main observations. can you make this plain text for arxiv abstarct

 - **Abstract**
 We report the discovery of multiple compact molecular features exhibiting extremely broad velocity widths toward the W44 molecular cloud. ALMA CO $J$=3--2 data reveal eight ``Petit--Bullets'' surrounding the previously known ``Bullet.'' Each Petit--Bullet shows a distinct V-shaped structure in position--velocity space, reminiscent of the Y-shaped morphology of the Bullet, suggesting a common origin. These features are interpreted as the result of high-velocity plunges of compact gravitational objects into dense molecular gas. The spatial and kinematic properties of the Petit--Bullets suggest that the plunging material was not a single object but rather a small cluster of compact bodies. A virial mass of $1.0\!\times\! 10^{5}\, M_\odot$ inferred from their velocity dispersion is comparable to that of typical globular clusters. Momentum analysis further implies that the main Bullet likely formed by an isolated black hole. These findings provide new evidence for dynamical interactions between halo clusters and disk molecular gas.

 - **Abstract**
 Binaries in which both stars are pulsating are rare but extremely valuable. We present the first study of an asteroseismic binary system consisting of a core helium-burning red clump (RC) star and a red giant branch (RGB) star. The Kepler target KIC 10841730 is a wide binary (period $2917 \pm 8$ d) that provides ideal conditions to test the accuracy of RC models. While prior studies of RC stars have revealed discrepancies in modelling the period spacings of mixed modes, other model parameters remain largely untested. We perform a detailed modelling analysis using individual mode frequencies and cover a large parameter space in mass, metallicity, He-abundance, mixing length, overshooting, and mass-loss, and we also explore different methods to correct for surface effects. We find two possible results for the red clump models. One solution requires introducing an unexpected offset of the phase shift in the red clump model, yielding an age consistent with the companion star and current masses of $1.01 \pm 0.06$ and $1.08 \pm 0.06$ M$_\odot$ for the RC and RGB star, respectively. Alternatively, we find that excluding the identification of two questionable radial modes resolves the phase-shift offset issue but results in a higher mass and thus a much younger age for the red clump star, contradicting the age obtained from its companion. We conclude that uncertainties in red clump models affect not only the g-mode period spacings but also the properties of the p modes. We show the power of asteroseismic binaries in validating and constraining stellar models and highlight the need for refining red-clump models.

 - **Abstract**
 When an object is scattered near a supermassive black hole (SMBH), tidal oscillations excited within it reduce its orbital energy, leading to capture by the SMBH. This process, called tidal capture, can also occur when the object approaches even closer to the SMBH, resulting in a partial tidal disruption event (pTDE). Previous studies on pTDEs of main-sequence stars have shown that as the disruption intensifies, dynamical effects dominate over tidal oscillations, causing the remnant material to acquire a kick velocity instead of being captured by the SMBH. In this work, we performed hydrodynamic numerical simulations of pTDEs involving giant stars. We found that for weaker disruptions, the dynamical behavior of the remnant material resembles that of main-sequence stars. However, as the disruptions deepen, the remnant material transitions from gaining energy to losing energy, leading to capture by the SMBH. This behavior markedly differs from that of main-sequence stars, demonstrating that the presence of a compact core significantly influences the dynamical processes in pTDEs. Our simulations reveal that the energy change of the remnant material strongly correlates with asymmetric mass -- lossspecifically, the difference in mass outflow between the Lagrange points L1 and L2. This suggests that the energy change stems from asymmetric mass loss, consistent with conclusions from previous studies on main-sequence stars. However, quantitative analysis contradicts earlier models, indicating that the dynamical model of pTDEs requires further refinement. Finally, we discuss the characteristics of repeating pTDEs produced by this process and their potential observability, as well as the implications for the long-term orbital evolution of high eccentricity extreme mass ratio inspiral systems.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the Meerkat Asteroid Guard, an imminent impactor warning service developed and maintained by the European Space Agency's Near-Earth Object Coordination Centre (NEOCC). The software uses the method of systematic ranging to perform orbit determination on tracklets in the Near-Earth Object Confirmation Page (NEOCP), which typically have short observational arcs. Fitted orbits are propagated to determine the likelihood of an impact with Earth. In addition, magnitude fitting and Monte Carlo sampling are performed to estimate the object's size, possible impact locations and times, and suggest a best telescope pointing for object follow-up. A set of object scores are produced from computed posterior probabilities across the grid, giving a statistical description of the object's orbital and physical characteristics. The scores are packaged with several informative plots in an email alert, which is sent to Meerkat subscribers in the event of a significant impact probability, close approach, or other scientifically interesting event. The highlights of the five years of Meerkat's operational service are presented, including the successful warnings for all of the past six imminent impactors discovered before impact and several interesting close approaches.

 - **Abstract**
 We analyse a sample of 225 star-forming regions from the DESIRED-E project, each with simultaneous determinations of the electron temperature from ionized nitrogen and oxygen, $T_{\rm e}$([NII]) and $T_{\rm e}$([OIII]), respectively. We derive new empirical relations connecting the gas-phase metallicity to the global electron temperature, $T_{\rm e}$(H$^+$), as determined via radio observations. We establish two calibrations: one assuming a homogeneous temperature distribution ($t^2 = 0$, the ``direct method''), and another accounting for internal temperature fluctuations ($t^2 > 0$). Applying these calibrations to 460 radio observations of Galactic HII~regions spanning Galactocentric distances from $\sim0.1$ to 16 kpc, we determine the radial O/H gradient in the Milky Way under both assumptions. We further compare these nebular gradients to independent metallicity estimates from young O- and B-type stars and Cepheid variables. We find that the $t^2 > 0$ calibration yields a gradient in excellent agreement with stellar-based determinations, whereas the $t^2 = 0$ method underestimates metallicities by up to $\sim$0.3 dex. This discrepancy cannot be reconciled by invoking oxygen depletion onto dust grains or nucleosynthetic processing via the CNO cycle in massive stars. We also find that one widely used relation in the literature, assuming $t^2 = 0$, produces an excessively steep gradient -- likely due to the use of outdated atomic data and pre-CCD observations. Finally, we explore potential azimuthal variations in the Galactic metallicity distribution driven by the presence of the spiral arms, finding no evidence for variations larger than $\sim$0.1 dex with respect to the general radial gradient.
#### Discovery of 1H-cyclopent[cd]indene (c-C11H8) in TMC-1 with the QUIJOTE line survey: A new three-ringed polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon

 - **Abstract**
 We report the detection of the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) 1H-cyclopent[cd]indene (c-C11H8) in TMC-1 with the QUI- JOTE line survey. We detected 22 independent lines corresponding to 88 rotational transitions with quantum numbers ranging from J=19 up to J=24 and Ka <= 5 in the Q-band range. The identification of this new PAH was based on the agreement between the rotational parameters derived from the analysis of the lines and those obtained by quantum chemical calculations. The column density derived for 1H-cyclopent[cd]indene is (6.0 +- 0.5) x 10^12 cm-2, with a rotational temperature of 9 K. Its abundance is high, as is that of the rest of the PAHs, but it is the lowest of all those detected to date in TMC-1, being 2.66 times less abundant than indene and 4.66 times less than phenalene. This result will help us to better understand the growth of five- and six-membered rings in dark clouds. Chemical models explaining their formation through the bottom-up model are still very incomplete and require further experimental and theoretical effort. Even so, the most likely formation reactions would occur between the smallest rings with small hydrocarbons; the most probable reaction for the formation of cyclopentindene is that between indene and C2H, C2H3, and/or their cation.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the analysis of four microlensing events, KMT-2020-BLG-0202, KMT-2022-BLG-1551, KMT-2023-BLG-0466, and KMT-2025-BLG-0121, which exhibit extended and complex anomalies in their light curves. These events were identified through a systematic reanalysis of KMTNet data aimed at detecting planetary signals that deviate from the typical short-term anomaly morphology. Detailed modeling indicates that all four anomalies were produced by planetary companions to low-mass stellar hosts. The events have mass ratios of $q \sim (5$--$14)\times10^{-3}$ and Einstein timescales of $t_{\rm E} \sim 20$--$43$ days. Bayesian analyses based on Galactic models show that the companions are super-Jupiters with masses of a few to approximately 10 $M_{\rm J}$, orbiting sub-solar-mass hosts located at distances of $D_{\rm L} \sim 4$--$7$~kpc. All planets lie well beyond the snow line of their hosts, placing them in the regime of cold giant planets. These detections demonstrate that extended and complex microlensing anomalies, which are often challenging to recognize as planetary in origin, can nonetheless contain planetary signals. This work underscores the unique sensitivity of microlensing to cold, massive planets beyond the snow line and highlights the importance of systematic reanalyses of survey data for achieving a more complete and unbiased census of exoplanets in the Galaxy.

 - **Abstract**
 Magnetic fields and turbulence may play a key role in the evolution of protoclusters, influencing the formation of dense cores and stars. Here, we examine the morphology of the magnetic fields in the G327.29 protocluster using both the velocity gradient technique (VGT) extracted from molecular line emissions and linear polarization in the dust continuum emission. The VGT analysis is performed using four molecular tracers: DCN (3-2), C18O (2-1), HN13C (3-2), and H13CO+ (3-2) - which probe gas across different density regimes, observed with the ALMA 12 m array. Owing to its sensitivity to gas dynamics, a comparison between VGT and dust polarization provides a powerful probe of the evolutionary processes in massive star-forming regions. From our analysis we reveal a complex magnetic-field structure, shaped by the combined influence of turbulence and gravity. In addition, it also appears that there is a large-scale (beyond the core scale) gravitational infall from the surrounding medium on to the filament and the central densest region. Furthermore, we observe that cores are dominated by a mix of turbulence and gravity. Overall, this work presents, likely for the first time, the application of VGT to a massive protocluster, G327.29, using high-resolution ALMA observations.

 - **Abstract**
 Deuterium fractionation becomes highly efficient in cold, dense cores where CO is frozen out. Cyclopropenylidene (c-C3H2), an early-formed carbon ring, and its deuterated isotopologues trace gas-phase deuteration in these environments. We present a statistical study of c-C3H2 deuteration in starless and prestellar cores of the Perseus Molecular Cloud using observations of c-C3H2, c-C3HD and c-C3D2 obtained with the Yebes 40 m, ARO 12 m and IRAM 30 m telescopes towards 16 cores. Gaussian fits and RADEX modeling yield column densities for the detected species. c-C3H2 is detected in 14/15 covered cores, c-C3HD in 15/16, and c-C3D2 in 9/16. Derived column densities range from 0.5-8.1 x 10^{13} cm^{-2} for c-C3H2, 0.2-2.1 x 10^{12} cm^{-2} for c-C3HD, and 0.6-1.6 x 10^{11} cm^{-2} for c-C3D2. The ortho-to-para ratio of c-C3H2 is obtained for all but one core, with a median value of 3.5\pm0.4. Statistically corrected D/H ratios span 0.5-9.2% (median 1.5\pm0.2%), and D2/D ratios 9-55% (median 25.9\pm4.3%). No trend is found between the c-C3H2 ortho-to-para ratio and core evolutionary stage traced by n(H2). The median D/H ratio in Perseus appears lower than values reported for Taurus and Chamaeleon, while the D2/D ratio agrees with Taurus within uncertainties. A positive correlation between D/H and n(H2) supports the use of D/H as an evolutionary tracer. D2/D does not correlate with n(H2), but shows a positive correlation with T_{kin}, suggesting that its formation is influenced by a mildly endothermic pathway.

 Using new Institut de Radioastronomie Millimétrique (IRAM) 30m telescope $\rm N_2H^+$, $\rm C^{18}O$ $J$=1-0 and Atacama Pathfinder Experiment (APEX) telescope $\rm ^{13}CO$ and $\rm C^{18}O$ $J$=2-1 maps together with archival far-infrared continuum data, and $\rm ^{12}CO$, and $\rm ^{13}CO$ $J$=1-0 data, we present a comprehensive analysis of the massive filament CFG024.00$+$0.48 (G24) across clump-to-cloud scales. Our results show that G24 is an $\sim$80 pc giant filament with a total mass of $\sim$$10^5$ M$_{\odot}$. In the different tracers the filament width is measured to be about $\sim$2 times the beam size of the observations, as expected for power-law density distributions, giving beam-deconvolved widths in the range from 0.8 to 2.8 pc. We determine a line-of-sight thickness of $\sim$2.2 pc demonstrating that G24 is not an edge-on, flatten structure. The virial parameter obtained from line mass ($\alpha_{\rm line,vir}=M_{\rm line,vir}/M_{\rm line}$) from the $\rm C^{18}O$ (1-0) data is 0.85, and that obtained from $Herschel$-based H$_2$ column density is 0.52, suggesting G24 is globally close to virial equilibrium. The distribution of the 40 dust clumps appears to have a ''two-tier'' fragmentation pattern. For the clump groups, the separation, with a mean/median of 3.68/3.46 pc, is very close to expected length associated with the maximum fragmentation growth rate of $\lambda_{\rm max}=3.55 \pm0.32$ pc estimated for the dust. However, the longitudinal centroid velocity profiles of $\rm C^{18}O$ and $\rm N_2H^+$ show oscillation patterns with wavelengths of 9.8$\pm$0.1 pc and 9.9$\pm$0.1 pc, respectively. This is $\sim$2 times larger than the corresponding values of $\lambda_{\rm max}$ of 4.96$\pm$0.63 pc and 4.65$\pm$1.34 pc, respectively. This suggests that the velocity structure is not dominated by flows directly associated with the fragmentation seen in the dust emission.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we explore the possibility of using quantum computers provided for usage in cloud by big companies (such as IBM, IonQ, IQM Quantum Computers, etc.) to run our quantum neural network (QNN) developed for data analysis in the context of LISA Space Mission, developed with the Qiskit library in Python. Our previous work demonstrated that our QNN learns patterns in gravitational wave (GW) data much faster than a classical neural network, making it suitable for fast GW signal detection in future LISA data streams. Analyzing the fees from hardware providers like IBM Quantum, Amazon Braket and Microsoft Azure, we found that the fees for running the first segment of our QNN sum up to \$2000, \$60000, and \$1000000 respectively. Using free plans, we succeed to run the 3-qubit feature map of the QNN for one random data sample on {\fontfamily{qcr} \selectfont ibm\_kyoto} and {\fontfamily{qcr}\selectfont IQM Quantum Computers\_Garnet} quantum computers, obtaining a fidelity of 99\%; we could also run the first prediction segment of our QNN on {\fontfamily{qcr} \selectfont ibm\_kyoto}, implemented for 4 qubits, and obtained a prediction accuracy of 20\%. We queried providers such as IBM Quantum, Amazon Braket, Pasqal, and Munich Quantum Valley to obtain access to their plans, but, with the exception of Amazon Braket, our applications remain unanswered to this day. Other major setbacks in using the quantum computers we had access to included Qiskit library version issues (as in the cases of IBM Quantum and IQM Quantum Computers) and the frequent unavailability of the devices, as was the case with the Microsoft Azure provider. All the results presented in this paper were accumulated in 2024.

 - **Abstract**
 The unprecedented wavelength coverage and sensitivity of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) permits to measure the absorption features of a wide range of condensate species from Silicates to Titan tholins. Atmospheric retrievals are uniquely suited to analyse these datasets and characterize the aerosols present in exoplanet atmospheres. However, including the optical properties of condensed particles within retrieval frameworks remains computationally expensive, limiting our ability to fully exploit JWST observations. In this work, we improve the computational efficiency and scaling behavior of aerosol models in atmospheric retrievals, enabling in-depth studies including multiple condensate species within practical time scales. Rather than computing the aerosol Mie coefficients for each sampled model, we pre-compute extinction efficiency (Qext), scattering efficiency (Qscat) and asymmetry parameter (g) grids for seven condensate species relevant in exoplanet atmospheres (Mg2SiO4 amorph sol - gel, MgSiO3 amorph glass, MgSiO3 amorph sol - gel, SiO2 alpha, SiO2 amorph, SiO and Titan tholins). The pre-computed Qext grids significantly reduce computation time between 1.4 and 17 times with negligible differences on the retrieved parameters. They also scale effortlessly with the number of aerosol species while maintaining the accuracy of cloud models. Thereby enabling more complex retrievals as well as broader population studies without increasing the overall error budget. The Qext, Qscat and g grids are freely available on Zenodo as well as a public TauREx plugin -TauREx-PCQ- that utilize them.

 - **Abstract**
 Binary stars are as common as single stars. The number of detected planets orbiting binaries is rapidly increasing thanks to the synergy between transit surveys, Gaia and high-resolution direct imaging campaigns. However, global planet formation models around binary stars are still underdeveloped, which limits the theoretical understanding of planets orbiting binary star systems. Hereby we introduce the PAIRS project, which aims at building a global planet formation model for planets in binaries, and to produce planet populations synthesis to statistically compare theory and observations. In this first paper, we present the adaptation of the circumstellar disc to simulate the formation of S-type planets. The presence of a secondary star tidally truncates and heats the outer part of the circumprimary disc (and vice-versa for the circumsecondary disc), limiting the material to form planets. We implement and quantify this effect for a range of binary parameters by adapting the Bern Model of planet formation in its pebble-based form and for in-situ planet growth. We find that the disc truncation has a strong impact on reducing the pebble supply for core growth, steadily suppressing planet formation for binary separations below 160 au, when considering all the formed planets more massive than Mars. We find as well that S-type planets tend to form close to the central star with respect to the binary separation and disc truncation radius. Our newly developed model will be the basis of future S-type planet population synthesis studies.

 - **Abstract**
 The Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) will produce unprecedented volumes of heterogeneous astronomical data (images, catalogs, and alerts) that challenge traditional analysis pipelines. The LSST Dark Energy Science Collaboration (DESC) aims to derive robust constraints on dark energy and dark matter from these data, requiring methods that are statistically powerful, scalable, and operationally reliable. Artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) are already embedded across DESC science workflows, from photometric redshifts and transient classification to weak lensing inference and cosmological simulations. Yet their utility for precision cosmology hinges on trustworthy uncertainty quantification, robustness to covariate shift and model misspecification, and reproducible integration within scientific pipelines. This white paper surveys the current landscape of AI/ML across DESC's primary cosmological probes and cross-cutting analyses, revealing that the same core methodologies and fundamental challenges recur across disparate science cases. Since progress on these cross-cutting challenges would benefit multiple probes simultaneously, we identify key methodological research priorities, including Bayesian inference at scale, physics-informed methods, validation frameworks, and active learning for discovery. With an eye on emerging techniques, we also explore the potential of the latest foundation model methodologies and LLM-driven agentic AI systems to reshape DESC workflows, provided their deployment is coupled with rigorous evaluation and governance. Finally, we discuss critical software, computing, data infrastructure, and human capital requirements for the successful deployment of these new methodologies, and consider associated risks and opportunities for broader coordination with external actors.

#### Keck Observations in the INfrared of Taurus and $ρ$ Oph Exoplanets And Ultracool dwarfs (KOINTREAU) I: A Planetary-Mass Companion and a Disk-Obscured Stellar Companion Discovered in Taurus

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first discoveries from Keck Observations in the INfrared of Taurus and $\rho$ Oph Exoplanets And Ultracool dwarfs (KOINTREAU), an adaptive optics imaging survey of young stars in the Taurus and $\rho$ Oph star-forming regions using the Keck infrared pyramid wavefront sensor (PyWFS). We have found two faint ($\Delta$K~7 mag), wide-separation companions to two ~3-Myr-old Taurus members. Relative astrometry for these systems show that both companions are bound to their host stars. We obtained near-infrared spectra of these companions using IRTF/SpeX (R~100) and Gemini/GNIRS (R~1000-2000), and combine these with photometry from our NIRC2 imaging, the Pan-STARRS survey, and Spitzer/IRAC archival imaging to constrain their properties. One companion, KOINTREAU-1b (at a projected separation of 690 au), has an average near-IR spectral type of M9$\pm$2, a gravity classification of VL-G, and a changing spectral type between the SpeX (M7) and GNIRS (L1) observations. We estimate this object's mass to be $10.6^{+2.5}_{-2.3}$ M$_{\rm Jup}$, making KOINTREAU-1b the fifth planetary-mass companion found in Taurus. The other companion, KOINTREAU-2b (projected separation 560 au), has a spectral type of M4.5$\pm$1 but is ~4 magnitudes underluminous relative to other Taurus stars of the same spectral type. We detect exceptionally strong He I 1.083 micron emission from this object, indicative of outflows driven by ongoing accretion, but with a conspicuous lack of accompanying H emission. We conclude that KOINTREAU-2b is a young star obscured by an edge-on disk and observed in scattered light. Finally, we derive a distortion solution for NIRC2 imaging which shows a 0.118° difference in position angle from the previous distortion solution.

 - **Abstract**
 A number of simulations have seen the emergence of strongly-toroidally-magnetized accretion disks from interstellar medium inflows. Recently, Guo et al. 2025 (G25) studied an idealized test problem of toroidally-magnetized disks in isothermal ideal MHD with an Eulerian static-mesh method, and argued the midplane behavior changes qualitatively (with a significant loss of toroidal magnetic flux) when the the thermal scale-length is resolved ($\Delta x < H_{\rm thermal}$). We rerun the G25 test problem with two Lagrangian methods: meshless finite-mass, and meshless finite-volume. We show that Lagrangian methods reproduce the high-resolution ($\Delta x \ll H_{\rm thermal}$) Eulerian G25 results. At low resolution ($\Delta x \gg H_{\rm thermal}$), behaviors differ: Lagrangian methods still lose flux and evolve 'as close as possible' to the converged solution, while Eulerian methods show no evolution. We argue this difference in convergence behavior is related to the ability of Lagrangian codes to follow flows to an arbitrarily thin midplane layer, analogous to the well-studied difference in Jeans fragmentation problems. This and results from other higher-resolution simulations and different codes suggest that the sustained midplane toroidal fields seen in recent Lagrangian multi-scale, multi-physics simulations cannot be a numerical resolution effect, and some physical difference between those simulations and the G25 test problem explains their different behaviors.

 - **Abstract**
 Radio pulsar timing, X-ray pulse profile modeling or gravitational-wave detections of binary mergers involving at least one neutron star offer the opportunity to elucidate the properties of dense and neutron rich matter in thermodynamic regimes inaccessible to nuclear laboratories. Such inference relies on building appropriate equation-of-state priors, such as the recently introduced semi-agnostic constructions that incorporate nuclear theory and experimental information available in low to intermediate density regimes, while offering the necessary flexibility at high density. In this paper, we assess how detections of mass, radius, and tidal deformability for low-mass ($\sim 1$M$_{\odot}$) or high-mass ($\sim 1.9$M$_{\odot}$) neutron stars would contribute to constraining nuclear empirical parameters in an inference based on semi-agnostic equation-of-state priors. We first assessed the correlation factors between nuclear empirical parameters and the zero-temperature and $\beta$-equilibrated pressure in different regimes of density. We then simulate observations for three nucleonic equations of state to test the recovery of the corresponding nuclear empirical parameters. We show that not all nuclear empirical parameters significantly correlate with the pressure and find a competition between them in the high-density regime that challenges their inference. We also find that using semi-agnostic constructions instead of assuming a nucleonic content up to the highest densities in the neutron-star core can help recover more accurately the true nuclear empirical parameters. Parameterizing the high-density regime of the equation of state with the nucleonic meta-model can pollute the inference of nuclear empirical parameters; semi-agnostic constructions are a solution to that. However, many nuclear matter empirical parameters contribute in a similar way to the building of baryonic pressure.

 - **Abstract**
 Crater~II (CraII) is a very intriguing, low-surface brightness and extended galaxy in the vicinity of our Milky Way. Motivated by its huge area and the number of RR Lyrae stars (RRLS) detected near to its core, we performed a follow-up campaign to get deep multi-band ($g,i$) and multi-epoch DECam observations in the outskirts of CraII, covering up to 8$r_h$ in the North-East direction and up to 13$r_h$ in the South-West direction (spanning almost 10 degr in the sky across the galaxy). We confirm the existence of tails coming out from CraII. In our survey, we detected a total of 97 periodic variable stars, of which 46 are CraII members [37 RRLS and 7 anomalous Cepheids (AC)]. The RRLS show a strong gradient in distance of 3.7~kpc/deg, which follows the relation: $d (\rm {kpc}) = (-3.70\pm 0.21)\, \xi' + (116.2 \pm 0.32)$ (where $\xi'$ is the planar coordinate rotated to fit the CraII tails). We also found an indication that the gradient in distance in the distant part of the near-side tail (North-East) may be less steep than it is in the inner $5°$. The leading tail also displays a significant over-density of RRLS located $\sim 3.25$ deg from the center of CraII. Despite covering a smaller area than previous works, our deeper photometry has allowed us to unveil more variable stars in the region and better define the tidal tails of CraII.

 - **Abstract**
 The Galactic magnetar SGR 1935+2154 has exhibited prolific high-energy (HE) bursting activity in recent years. Investigating its potential tera-electronvolt counterpart could provide insights into the underlying mechanisms of magnetar emission and very high-energy (VHE) processes in extreme astrophysical environments. We aim to search for a possible tera-electronvolt counterpart to both its persistent and sub-second-scale burst emission. We analysed over 25 h of observations from the Large-Sized Telescope prototype (LST-1) of the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO) during periods of HE activity from SGR 1935+2154 in 2021 and 2022 to search for persistent emission. For bursting emission, we selected and analysed nine 0.1 s time windows centred around known short X-ray bursts, targeting potential sub-second-scale tera-electronvolt counterparts in a low-photon-statistics regime. While no persistent or bursting emission was detected in our search, we establish upper limits for the tera-electronvolt emission of a short magnetar burst simultaneous to its soft gamma-ray flux. Specifically, for the brightest burst in our sample, the ratio between tera-electronvolt and X-ray flux is less than $10^{-3}$. The non-detection of either persistent or bursting tera-electronvolt emission from SGR 1935+2154 suggests that if such components exist, they may occur under specific conditions not covered by our observations. This aligns with theoretical predictions of VHE components in magnetar-powered fast radio bursts and the detection of MeV - GeV emission in giant magnetar flares. These findings underscore the potential of magnetars, fast radio bursts, and other fast transients as promising candidates for future observations in the low-photon-statistics regime with Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes, particularly with the CTAO.

 - **Abstract**
 Polarization-mode observations from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) are powerful tools for studying the dust grain populations in circumstellar disks. Many sources exhibit polarization signatures consistent with aligned dust grains, yet the physical origin of this alignment remains uncertain. One such source is BHB07-11, a Class I protobinary object in the Pipe Nebula with complex spiral arm structures in its circumbinary disk. While magnetic fields are often invoked to explain grain alignment in the interstellar medium, the contrasting conditions in circumstellar disk environments demand further investigation into grain alignment mechanisms. To determine BHB07-11's dominant polarization mechanism, we leverage ALMA polarization-mode dust continuum observations in Bands 3 ($\lambda$=3.1 mm), 6 ($\lambda$=1.3 mm), and 7 ($\lambda$=0.87 mm), in combination with high-resolution dust continuum and spectral line observations in Band 6. Observed polarization vectors in each band are consistent with emission from aligned grains and follow the structure of the spiral arms as shown in the high-resolution observations. Given the relationship between the observed polarization vector orientation and the spiral arms, we find that the polarization morphology is most consistent with grains aligned through a relative velocity flow between gas and dust in the spiral arms, as envisioned in the recently developed badminton birdie-like alignment mechanism, rather than alignment with a magnetic field or other known alignment mechanisms.

 - **Abstract**
 Microquasars (MQs) are Galactic binary systems, consisting of a star and a compact object, a neutron star or a stellar mass black hole, which accretes matter from its companion star and gives rise to relativistic jets. Recent detection of very-high-energy (VHE; $E \gtrsim 100,\text{GeV}$) and ultra-high-energy (UHE; $E \gtrsim 100,\text{TeV}$) gamma-rays by LHAASO, HAWC and HESS from the MQ V4641 Sgr and SS 433 suggests them as Galactic PeVatrons. In this work, we studied a hadronic origin of the observed TeV-PeV gamma-ray emission from these MQs. We considered the hadronic scenario where the gamma-rays are produced by the interaction of relativistic protons in the MQ jet with the stellar wind. We fitted our model with observed data and constrained physical parameters like the hadronic jet power fraction, the proton spectral index, the maximum proton energy and the jet bulk Lorentz factor. Our best-fit model shows hard proton spectra ($1.84-2.44$) and maximum proton energies between 1 and 5 PeV. We also estimated the all-flavor neutrino fluxes corresponding to the gamma-ray fluxes from the hadronic model and found that V4641 sgr can be detected by next-generation neutrino telescopes like KM3NeT-ARCA and TRIDENT. Furthermore, we modeled a synthetic population of Galactic MQs and estimated their contribution to the diffuse TeV-PeV gamma-ray flux. For the inner Galaxy PSR contribution dominates in the range 10-100 TeV, and above 100 TeV diffused cosmic ray interactions with the molecular clouds is most dominant. We find that a population $\sim 14$ MQs is required to explain the LHAASO data above 100 TeV. For the outer Galaxy, we show that MQs are the dominant class of sources, and we constrain their population $\sim$14. Our findings strongly suggest that MQs are efficient particle accelerators, contributing to Galactic PeVatrons and potential multimessenger sources in our Galaxy.

 - **Abstract**
 OB associations are primordial tracers of star formation and Galactic structure. Originally defined about 80 years ago, their historical membership lists have been superseded thanks to the precise astrometry from ESA's \textit{Gaia}'s satellite. Recent studies have however been mostly focused on individual OB associations or limited by the coverage of spectroscopic surveys. In this paper, we exploit a complete census of $\sim$25,000 O- and B-type stars within 1 kpc of the Sun to produce a highly-reliable catalogue of 57 OB associations using the HDBSCAN clustering algorithm, increasing the number of known OB associations by a factor of two within this volume. We assess the validity of this catalogue by crossmatching our OB association members with other catalogues of OB associations, star clusters and young stellar groups, confirming the high-confidence of our census of OB associations. We characterize these OB associations physically (total initial stellar mass, number of OB stars, ...) and kinematically (velocity dispersion, linear expansion ages, ...). Nearly three quarters of the OB associations (41 out of 57) exhibit a significant expansion pattern in at least one direction, including 13 in both plane-of-the-sky directions, though differences in expansion velocity suggest anisotropical expansion patterns. We compare the locations of these OB associations with superclouds and features in the local Milky Way such as the Radcliffe Wave and discuss the implications for star formation in the solar neighbourhood.

 - **Abstract**
 We present LBTI/ALES 3.07-4.08 micron spectroscopic observations of HD~33632~Ab, a ~53 M_Jup directly imaged companion to an F8 star. Spectroscopic measurements of HD 33632 Ab now span 1-4 micron, and we perform the first spectroscopic analysis covering this full range. The data are compared to isolated brown dwarf template spectra, indicating that HD 33632 Ab is similar to L8/9 field brown dwarfs. Synthetic atmosphere model spectra from multiple model families are fit, with cloudy models providing the best fits, consistent with expectations for an L-dwarf. Evolutionary model predictions for the bulk properties of HD 33632 Ab are highly constrained by the precise dynamical mass found for the object. In particular, predictions for surface gravity are narrowly peaked, log(g)=5.21+/-0.05, and not dependent on the effects of clouds or cloud dispersion. We find significant tension between the surface gravities and object radii inferred from atmosphere model fits and those predicted by evolutionary models. We conclude with a comparison to the spectra of the HR 8799 c, d, and e, and emphasize the case that HD 33632 Ab, and other L/T transition directly imaged companions with constrained masses, will serve an essential role in understanding the complex physical processes governing the appearance of clouds in planetary atmospheres.
#### Asteroseismology of SPB stars: a comparison of forward asteroseismic modelling results from Kepler and TESS

 - **Abstract**
 The slowly pulsating B (SPB) stars are a class of variable star with masses between about 3 and 8 M$_{\odot}$. Their gravity-mode pulsation frequencies are sensitive to the near-core structure, which makes them useful probes of rotation and mixing in the deep stellar interior. Time series photometry, such as from the Kepler and TESS space telescopes, allows the extraction of their pulsation frequencies and construction of period spacing patterns. Previously, samples of slowly pulsating B stars were observed by the Kepler mission and underwent forward asteroseismic modelling to retrieve stellar parameters such as mass, age and core mass. However, all of these stars have since been re-observed by the ongoing TESS mission with light curves that are usually shorter and non-continuous, resulting in more difficult frequency extraction and interpretation in terms of constructing period spacing patterns. In this paper we compare the results of forward asteroseismic modelling of a sample of SPB stars using intermittent TESS light curve data to those based on long-duration Kepler light curves. We show how in some cases that the masses and core masses derived from only a few sectors of TESS data agree well with the 4-yr Kepler mission results, despite the stars having far fewer significant pulsation frequencies in their TESS light curves. However, some stars yield incompatible results, emphasising the complexities in forward asteroseismic modelling of gravity-mode pulsators with sparsely sampled or short duration TESS light curves.

 - **Abstract**
 Dark matter is expected to accumulate inside neutron stars, modifying the structure of isolated stars and influencing both the dynamics of binary mergers and the evolution of the resulting hypermassive remnants. Since differential rotation is the primary mechanism delaying the collapse of these remnants, understanding its behavior is crucial when assessing the impact of an embedded dark component. In this work, we extend the numerical code RNS to describe two gravitationally coupled fluids in differential rotation, with baryonic matter modeled by a realistic nuclear equation of state and dark matter represented as a self-interacting bosonic condensate. Within this framework, we construct equilibrium sequences for a representative differential rotation law, providing a basis to explore how dark matter may influence the global properties and rotational dynamics of binary neutron star remnants.
#### ALMAGAL VI. The spatial distribution of dense cores during the evolution of cluster-forming massive clump

 - **Abstract**
 High-mass stars and star clusters form from the fragmentation of massive dense clumps driven by gravity, turbulence, and magnetic fields. The ALMAGAL project observed $\sim1000$ clumps at $\sim$1000\,au resolution, enabling a statistically significant characterization of this process across a large range of clump physical parameters and evolutionary stages. In this work, we investigated the spatial distribution of dense cores in the 514 massive, potentially cluster-forming, clumps hosting at least 4 cores, to trace fragmentation's initial conditions and early evolution. We used quantitative descriptors, evaluated against the clump bolometric luminosity-to-mass ratio as an indicator of evolution. Core separations were measured with the minimum spanning tree method (MST) and compared with the Jeans gravitational fragmentation theory. We used the $Q$ parameter and the mass segregation ratio, $\Lambda_{MSR}$, to evaluate whether cores have specific arrangements or differences depending on their masses. ALMAGAL cores are usually arranged in elliptical groups with an axis ratio $e\sim2.2$, but $e\geq$5 is also observed. A single characteristic core separation per clump is found in $\sim76$% of cases, but signatures of multiple fragmentation lengths not rare. Typical core separations are compatible with the clump-averaged thermal Jeans length, $\lambda^{th}_{J}$, though a population, typical of low-fragmented/young clumps, has wider separations with $l\approx3\times\lambda^{th}_{J}$. The core separation decreases on average from $l\sim22000$ au in younger systems to $l\sim7000$ au in more evolved ones. Cores are typically distributed in fractal-type subclusters, with centrally concentrated patterns appearing only at later stages, but without a progressive evolutionary transition. Finally, mass segregation is found in 110 systems, with its occurrence increasing with evolution.

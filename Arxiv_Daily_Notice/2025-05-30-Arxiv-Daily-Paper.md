 - **Abstract**
 Extensive ground and space based surveys have now characterized the properties of thousands of exoplanets; their radii, masses, orbits around their host stars, and the beginnings of accurate measurements of the chemical compositions of their atmospheres and cores. How are these properties linked to their formation in physically and chemically evolving protoplanetary disks wherein they accrete pebbles, planetesimals, and gas as they undergo migration? To address this challenge, our review assembles a large and varied body of exoplanet observations as well as recent Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) and James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations of disk structure, chemistry, kinematics, and winds. The latest advances in theory and MHD simulations that bear on these issues are also reviewed and compared with the observations. Taken together, this review argues that a new dynamic paradigm for planet formation is emerging wherein MHD disk winds and not disk turbulence play a central role in disk evolution and planet formation including: angular momentum transport, gap and ring formation. disk astrochemistry, and planet formation and migration. These processes leave their mark on the resulting atmospheric composition, radii, and orbital characteristics of exoplanet populations, offering the possibility of future observational tests.

 - **Abstract**
 We propose a new framework for the simultaneous feedback of stellar winds and photo-ionizing radiation from massive stars, distinguishing the locations where forces are applied, and consequences for internal spatio-temporal evolution of the whole feedback bubble (FB). We quantify the relative dynamical importance of wind-blown bubbles (WBB) versus the photoionized region (PIR) by the ratio of the radius at which the WBB is in pressure equilibrium with the PIR, $R_{\rm eq}$, to the Strömgren radius, $R_{\rm St}$. $\zeta \equiv R_{\rm eq}/R_{\rm St}$ quantifies the dynamical dominance of WBBs ($\zeta > 1$) or the PIR ($\zeta < 1$). We calculate $\zeta$ and find that, for momentum-driven winds, $0.1 \lesssim \zeta \lesssim 1$ for the star-forming regions in (i) typical Milky Way-like giant molecular clouds (GMCs), (ii) the most massive of individual OB stars, and (iii) dense, low-metallicity environments, relevant in the early universe. In this regime, both WBBs and the PIR are dynamically important to the expansion of the FB. We develop a semi-analytic Co-Evolution Model (CEM) that takes into account the spatial distribution of forces and the back reactions of both the WBB and PIR. In the $\zeta <1$ regime where the CEM is most relevant, the model differs in the total FB momentum by up to 25% compared to naive predictions. In the weak-wind limit of $\zeta \ll 1$, applicable to individual OB stars or low-mass clusters, the CEM has factors $\gtrsim 2$ differences in WBB properties. In a companion paper we compare these models to three-dimensional, turbulent hydro-dynamical simulations.
#### The Co-Evolution of Stellar Wind-blown Bubbles and Photoionized Gas II: 3D RMHD Simulations and Tests of Semi-Analytic Models

 - **Abstract**
 In a companion paper (Paper I) we presented a Co-Evolution Model (CEM) in which to consider the evolution of feedback bubbles driven by massive stars through both stellar winds and ionizing radiation, outlining when either of these effects is dominant and providing a model for how they evolve together. Here we present results from three-dimensional radiation magneto-hydrodynamical (RMHD) simulations of this scenario for parameters typical of massive star-forming clouds in the Milky Way: precisely the regime where we expect both feedback mechanisms to matter. While we find that the CEM agrees with the simulations to within 25% for key parameters and modestly outperforms previous idealized models, disagreements remain. We show that these deviations originate mainly from the CEM's lack of (i) background inhomogeneity caused by turbulence and (ii) time-variable momentum enhancements in the wind-blown bubble (WBB). Additionally, we find that photoionized gas acts similarly to magnetic fields ([as in Lancaster et al. 2024a) by decreasing the WBB's surface area. This causes a decrease in the amount of cooling at the WBB's interface, resulting in an enhanced WBB dynamical impact.
#### The Narrow Formation Pathway of Hot Saturns: Constraints on Initial Planetary Properties

 - **Abstract**
 The observed exoplanet population exhibits a scarcity of short-period Saturn-mass planets, a phenomenon referred to as the ``hot Saturn desert". This observational scarcity can be utilized to validate the theories regarding the formation and evolution of gas planets. In this study, we conduct large-scale numerical simulations to explore how the initial conditions of gas planets orbiting solar-type and M-dwarf stars influence their evolutionary trajectories in the semi-major axis versus planetary radius ($a$-$R$) parameter space. We generate a synthetic population of 10,000 short-period gaseous planets by systematically varying their initial planetary masses ($M_{\rm p}$), initial planetary luminosities ($L_{\rm p}$), initial core mass fractions ($f_{\rm core}$), and semi-major axis ($a$). Furthermore, we assume these gaseous planets have ceased orbital migration and model their long-term thermal evolution, taking into account the impacts of atmospheric evaporation. Our results show that the initial mass, $L_{\rm p}$, and $f_{\rm core}$ are the dominant factors controlling radius evolution for short-period gas planets. The key to survival as a hot Saturn analogue appears to be having just the right combination of properties after gas disk dissipation: an $M_{\rm p}$ below 0.5 Jupiter Mass ($M_{\rm Jup}$), a substantial $f_{\rm core}$ of $\geq$ 30%, and relatively low $L_{\rm p}$ on the order of $10^{-6}$ solar luminosity ($L_{\odot}$) or less. The survival criteria for hot Saturn analogs align with theoretically unfavorable initial conditions of gas planets formed via core accretion scenario, naturally explaining the observed boundaries of the hot Saturn desert.
#### The Chemical Clock of High-mass Star-forming Regions: N2H+/CCS

 - **Abstract**
 Using the IRAM 30 m telescope, we presented observations of N2H+ J = 1-0, CCS JN = 87-76 and 77-66 lines toward a large sample of ultracompact HII regions (UC HIIs). Among our 88 UC HIIs, 87 and 33 sources were detected in the N2H+ J = 1-0 and CCS JN = 87-76 lines, respectively. For the CCS 77-66 transition, we detected emission in 10 out of 82 targeted sources, all of which also exhibited emission in the CCS JN = 87-76 line. Physical parameters are derived for our detections, including the optical depth and excitation temperature of N2H+, the rotational temperature of CCS and the column density. Combining our results and previous observation results in different stages of high-mass star-forming regions (HMSFRs), we found that the column density ratio N(N2H+)/N(CCS) increases from high-mass starless cores (HMSCs) through high-mass protostellar cores (HMPOs) to UC HIIs. This implies that N(N2H+)/N(CCS) can trace the evolution process of HMSFRs. It was supported by our gas-grain chemical model, which shows that N(N2H+)/N(CCS) increases with the evolution age of HMSFRs. The temperature, density and chemical age were also constrained from our best-fit model at each stage. Thus, we propose N(N2H+)/N(CCS) as a reliable chemical clock of HMSFRs.

 - **Abstract**
 Identifying key observables is essential for enhancing our knowledge of exoplanet habitability and biospheres, as well as improving future mission capabilities. While currently challenging, future observatories such as the Large Interferometer for Exoplanets (LIFE) will enable atmospheric observations of a diverse sample of temperate terrestrial worlds. Using thermal emission spectra that represent conventional predictions of atmospheric CO2 variability across the Habitable Zone (HZ), we assess the ability of the LIFE mission - as a specific concept for a future space-based interferometer - to detect CO2 trends indicative of the carbonate-silicate (Cb-Si) weathering feedback, a well-known habitability marker and potential biological tracer. Therefore, we explore the feasibility of differentiating between CO2 trends in biotic and abiotic planet populations. We create synthetic exoplanet populations based on geochemistry-climate predictions and perform retrievals on simulated thermal emission observations. The results demonstrate the robust detection of population-level CO2 trends in both biotic and abiotic scenarios for population sizes as small as 30 Exo-Earth Candidates (EECs) and the lowest assessed spectrum quality in terms of signal-to-noise ratio, S/N = 10, and spectral resolution, R = 50. However, biased CO2 partial pressure constraints hinder accurate differentiation between biotic and abiotic trends. If these biases were corrected, accurate differentiation could be achieved for populations with $\geq$ 100 EECs. We conclude that LIFE can effectively enable population-level characterization of temperate terrestrial atmospheres and detect Cb-Si cycle driven CO2 trends as habitability indicators. Nevertheless, the identified biases underscore the importance of testing atmospheric characterization performance against the broad diversity expected for planetary populations.

 - **Abstract**
 In developing a deeper understanding of the Circumgalactic Medium, one feature that is poorly understood is the nature of the ultraviolet background (UVB) and its impact on observed column densities. A wide array of UVB models have been created over the years by many different authors, each based on the latest observational data available at the time. In addition to having a large variance between model properties, the formatting between released models is also inconsistent. This data release provides reformatted versions of several widely-used ultraviolet background models-Faucher-Giguère et al. 2009, Haardt and Madau 2012, Puchwein et al. 2019, and Faucher-Giguère 2020-such that each model is in the same units and thus can be utilized to directly compare these models over a wide redshift range. This release also includes code to run a 'cloudy_cooling_tools' pipeline to generate ionization tables for different UVB models.
#### Turbulence in Primordial Dark Matter Halos and Its Impact on the First Star Formation

 - **Abstract**
 We present high-resolution simulations of the first star-forming clouds in 15 minihalos with masses ranging from $\sim 10^5$ to $10^7\ \text{M}_{\odot}$ at redshifts $z \sim 17 - 20$, using the \texttt{GIZMO} code. Our simulations incorporate detailed primordial gas physics and adopt initial conditions from the state-of-the-art TNG cosmological simulations. To achieve the required resolution, we apply a particle-splitting technique that increases the resolution of the original TNG data by a factor of $\sim 10^5$, reaching gas and dark matter particle masses of $0.2\ \text{M}_{\odot}$ and $80\ \text{M}_{\odot}$, respectively. This enables us to resolve gas accretion during the early assembly of minihalos and to capture the emergence of strong turbulent flows. We find that turbulence, driven by gas infall into the dark matter potential wells, is predominantly supersonic, with characteristic Mach numbers ranging from $1.8$ to $4.2$, increasing with halo mass. The supersonic turbulence effectively fragments the central gas cloud into multiple dense clumps, some of which form gravitationally bound cores and begin to collapse into the first stars. Our results suggest that supersonic turbulence is a common feature in minihalos and plays a key role in generating clumpy star-forming clouds, with important implications for the initial mass function of the first stars.

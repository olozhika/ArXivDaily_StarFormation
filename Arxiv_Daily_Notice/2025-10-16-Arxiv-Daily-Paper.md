 - **Abstract**
 Polarized synchrotron emission from ultra-relativistic electrons spiraling the Galactic magnetic field has become one of the most relevant emissions in the Interstellar medium these last years due to the improvement in the quality of low-frequency observations. One of the recent experiments designed to explore this emission is the QUIJOTE experiment. We aim to study the spatial variations of the synchrotron emission in the QUIJOTE MFI data, by dividing the sky into physically separated regions. For such task, we firstly use a novel component separation method based on artificial neural networks to clean the synchrotron maps. After training the network with simulations, we fit both $EE$ and $BB$ spectra by assuming a power-law model. Then, we give estimations for the index $\alpha_{S}$, the amplitude, and the ratio between $B$ and $E$ amplitudes. When analyzing the real data, we found a clear spatial variation of the synchrotron properties along the sky at 11 GHz, obtaining a steeper index in the Galactic plane of $\alpha_{S}^{EE} = -3.1 \pm 0.3$ and $\alpha_{S}^{BB} = -3.1 \pm 0.4$ and a flatter one at high Galactic latitudes of $\alpha_{S}^{EE} = -3.05 \pm 0.2$ and $\alpha_{S}^{B} = -2.98 \pm 0.27$. We found average values at all sky of $\alpha_{S}^{EE} = -3.04 \pm 0.21$ and $\alpha_{S}^{BB} = -3.00 \pm 0.34$. Furthermore, after obtaining an average value of $A_{S}^{EE} = 3.31 \pm 0.08$ $\mu K^{2}$ and $A_{S}^{BB} = 0.93 \pm 0.02$ $\mu K^{2}$, we estimate a ratio between $B$ and $E$ amplitudes of $A_{S}^{BB}/A_{S}^{EE} = 0.28 \pm 0.08$. Based on the results we conclude that, although neural networks seem to be valuable methods to apply on real ISM observations, combined analyses with Planck, WMAP and/or CBASS data are mandatory to reduce the contamination from QUIJOTE maps and then improve the accuracy of the estimations.

 - **Abstract**
 Investigating the multi-scale fragmentation of dense clumps into compact cores is essential for understanding the processes that govern the initial distribution of mass in stellar clusters and how high-mass stars ($>8~M_{\odot}$) form. We present a catalog of the hierarchical continuum structure from 904 clumps observed in the ALMAGAL program, a high resolution ($0.15-0.8$\arcsec) 1.38 mm Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) large program targeting dense clumps capable of high-mass star formation throughout the Galactic disk. We use \verb|astrodendro|, a dendrogram-based algorithm, on a uniform linear resolution (2000 au) version of the data to extract 5160 continuum structures with effective radii spanning $800-42000$ au and estimated masses between $~0.05-670~M_{\odot}$. With our large sample, we statistically examine the difference in clump properties for regions with varying levels of hierarchical complexity. We find that clumps exhibiting the richest hierarchical morphology have distributions with higher dust temperatures, surface densities, luminosity-to-mass (\textit{L/M}) ratios, and most massive core (MMC) masses, indicating that these regions tend to be at later evolutionary stages. We find a positive correlation between the mass of cores from the ALMAGAL core catalog and the surface density of their surrounding structures identified in this work. However, this correlation is weaker for cores in more evolved clumps, where lower mass cores can be found at higher local surface densities. This could indicate that some cores accrete mass less efficiently from the intra-clump reservoir than others, despite the total available mass increasing over time, a scenario that is congruent with a clump-fed core accretion model.

 - **Abstract**
 Analyzing large-scale scientific datasets presents substantial challenges due to their sheer volume, structural complexity, and the need for specialized domain knowledge. Automation tools, such as PandasAI, typically require full data ingestion and lack context of the full data structure, making them impractical as intelligent data analysis assistants for datasets at the terabyte scale. To overcome these limitations, we propose InferA, a multi-agent system that leverages large language models to enable scalable and efficient scientific data analysis. At the core of the architecture is a supervisor agent that orchestrates a team of specialized agents responsible for distinct phases of the data retrieval and analysis. The system engages interactively with users to elicit their analytical intent and confirm query objectives, ensuring alignment between user goals and system actions. To demonstrate the framework's usability, we evaluate the system using ensemble runs from the HACC cosmology simulation which comprises several terabytes.

 - **Abstract**
 The interaction of cosmic rays (CRs) with magnetic fields and the interstelar medium (ISM) leads to the production of nonthermal radiation. Although this has been a topic of study for many years, it still poses many challenges to the understanding of these processes. In this work we present a short review of recent advances in the understanding of CR propagation in magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) turbulence, in particular the process of mirror diffusion, and how it can help explain recent observational constraints for CR diffusion away from sources. We also present preliminary results from Monte Carlo simulations of CR cascading and propagation within a young massive stellar cluster (YMSC), aimed at probing the origin of very-high-energy (VHE) emission from these sources.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a new implementation of nuclear reaction networks in the \texttt{G}eneral-relativistic \texttt{mu}ltigrid \texttt{nu}merical (\texttt{Gmunu}) code, a framework for general relativistic radiation magnetohydrodynamics (GRRMHD). The extended code self-consistently evolves nuclear species coupled to hydrodynamics, magnetic fields, and neutrino radiation transport under the conformal flatness approximation to Einstein's equations. Four approximate nuclear networks are included, with stiff source terms integrated using implicit-explicit Runge-Kutta schemes. Validation is performed through benchmarks including conserved-to-primitive recovery with a tabulated stellar equation of state, one-zone silicon burning, and hydrodynamic tests of shock tubes, acoustic pulses, and detonation fronts of Type Ia supernovae. These tests confirm accurate coupling between nuclear reactions and fluid dynamics, conserving electron and nuclear mass fractions to machine precision. As an application, we conduct spherically symmetric core-collapse supernova simulations. The models reproduce the expected non-exploding behavior of standard progenitors, while enhanced neutrino heating revives the shock. Including nuclear burning modifies the post-shock composition and dynamics, converting silicon and oxygen layers into iron-group nuclei and strengthening the explosion. This demonstrates the impact of explosive burning on ejecta composition and shock evolution, and establishes the stability of the coupled GR radiation-MHD-nuclear framework. The implementation is fully compatible with multidimensional GRMHD simulations and represents the first GRRMHD code combining M1 neutrino transport with fully coupled nuclear burning.

 - **Abstract**
 We run a three-dimensional Galactic chemical evolution (GCE) model to follow the propagation of Mn-53 from supernovae of type Ia (SNIa), Fe-60 from core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe), Hf-182 from intermediate mass stars (IMSs), and Pu-244 from neutron star mergers (NSMs) in the Galaxy. We compare the GCE of these short-lived radioactive isotopes (SLRs) to recent detections on the deep-sea floor. We find that although these SLRs originate from different sites, they often arrive conjointly on Earth.

 - **Abstract**
 Since the launch of JWST, the sample size of reionization-era Lyman-alpha-emitters (LAEs) has been steadily growing; yet inferences about the neutral hydrogen fraction in the intergalactic medium exhibit increasing variance at redshift z ~ 7, possibly indicating significant field-to-field fluctuations in the progression of cosmic reionization. In this paper, we present new JWST/NIRSpec and Keck/LRIS spectra of nine LAEs in the redshift z ~ 7 protocluster, LAGER-z7OD1. Measurements of Lyman-alpha-transmission and Lyman-alpha velocity offset along multiple sightlines map the Lyman-alpha damping wing optical depth across the galaxy overdensity. In the standard context of inside-out ionization, we estimate radii of ionized bubbles (R(min) = 0.07 - 0.69 Mpc) based on the distance from each LAE to the first neutral patch along the sightline. The resulting 3D topology reveals three distinct sub-clusters where the ionized bubbles are approaching overlap. Five of the nine LAEs plausibly ionized their bubbles, a few bursts of star formation and a modest escape fraction are sufficient. We demonstrate, however, that the actual ionized volumes are likely larger, at least R(ism) = 0.42 - 1.29 Mpc, based on an empirical model for interstellar attenuation of Lyman-alpha. Modeling galactic attenuation of Lyman-alpha significantly increases the inferred intergalactic transmission (thus enlarging the ionized pathlength). The errorbars on the reddening correction allow fully overlapping bubbles, and our results are consistent with accelerated reionization in the protocluster.
#### The dependence of black hole formation in open clusters on the cluster formation process

 - **Abstract**
 We performed N-body simulations of both individual cluster evolution and subcluster coalescence, demonstrating that cluster evolution and its outcomes strongly depend on the cluster formation process through comparisons of different gas expulsion modes and formation channels. The evolution of star clusters is significantly shaped by the gas expulsion mode, with faster expulsion producing greater mass loss. A broader degeneracy exists among initial cluster mass, gas expulsion timescale, and formation channel (monolithic vs. coalescence), which manifests in both evolutionary pathways and black hole production. In individual cluster simulations, slower gas expulsion enables progressively lower-mass clusters to retain central black holes within the tidal radius. As the gas expulsion mode transitions from fast to moderate to slow, the fraction of high-velocity stars decreases. Variations in gas expulsion mode and formation channel ultimately influence the stellar velocity distribution (within the tidal radius), and thus the expansion speed, which governs both cluster mass loss and black hole retention. Slowly expanding clusters are more likely to retain black holes and multiple systems, making them prime candidates for black hole searches with {\it Gaia}. Our results highlight the crucial influence of early gas expulsion and cluster formation mechanisms on the dynamical evolution of star clusters and black hole production. These factors should be carefully incorporated into the initial conditions of N-body simulations, which necessarily rely on input from the star formation community.

 - **Abstract**
 We performed a statistical study of two old open clusters NGC 188 and M 67 using Gaia DR3 data. No tidal tails of the clusters were detected, which most likely had been destroyed when the cluster passed through the Galactic plane. The size estimates of the clusters depend on the range of astrometric parameters and stellar magnitudes of the stars used for star counts. The mass spectra of two clusters differ significantly. NGC 188 shows a deficit of low-mass stars compared to M 67. In the halo region of NGC 188 (compared to the core region of the cluster), there is a relative excess of the low-mass stars (just as in the case of M 67) and a deficit of stars in the mass range from 0.66 to 0.9 solar masses. Comparison with the Hunt & Reffert samples showed that almost all the stars from these samples are contained among the stars we selected for counting. Moreover, the group probability of these stars belonging to clusters, estimated by the uniform background method, is higher than 60%. It is shown that the velocity dispersion of single stars (selected according to the `stellar magnitude -- color index' diagrams) is significantly smaller than the velocity dispersion of unresolved binary stars.

 The detection of interstellar radionuclides in geological archives provides insights into nucleosynthesis in stars and stellar explosions as well as interstellar medium dynamics in the Local Bubble and the Local Interstellar Cloud. In this work, current projects to detect interstellar radionuclides with accelerator mass spectrometry will be reviewed. These projects aim to address unsolved questions regarding the timing and the origin of the influxes and to establish new radionuclides for future searches. For the first time, experimental evidence for an inhomogeneous deposition of interstellar 60Fe onEarthwill be presented and another potential source for 60Fe on Earth and the Moon, primary galactic cosmic rays, will be introduced.
#### Hyperons and $Δ$'s in rotating protoneutron stars: Local properties

 - **Abstract**
 The structural evolution of rotating protoneutron stars encodes essential information about their observable signatures, while microscopic properties provide complementary knowledge to advance observational investigations. Using a relativistic mean-field model with density-dependent couplings that account for temperature and particle composition, we investigate rotation, neutrino-emission-driven changes in angular momentum, particle distributions, temperature profiles, and sound speed to probe the internal dynamics of protoneutron star matter. Additionally, we track the evolution of macroscopic quantities such as energy distribution and gravitational mass and establish direct links between microphysics and global evolution. Extending the framework of Phys. Rev. D 112, 023007 (2025), which focuses on the global properties of rotating protoneutron star evolution, our results reveal that protoneutron star deformation and thermal evolution are governed by angular momentum, mass, and composition. Exotic matter (hyperons and $\Delta$-resonances) and rapid rotation enhance deformation leading to a reduction in core temperature, whereas slowly rotating stars like PSR J0740$+$6620 remain nearly spherical. Our predicted equatorial radii for PSR J0740$+$6620, $13.0\ \mathrm{km} < R_e < 13.5\ \mathrm{km}$, are consistent with NICER measurements. These findings constrain the EoS, requiring a self-consistent treatment of rotation, mass-dependent compression, and composition-driven modeling to accurately model protoneutron star evolution in the context of multi-messenger astrophysics.

 - **Abstract**
 A significant fraction of stars experience close interactions, including collisions resulting from gravitational encounters and mergers within close binary systems. These processes can produce more massive stars that may give rise to relatively rare objects such as blue stragglers. Distinguishing the outcomes of collisions and mergers is challenging yet essential for interpreting observations. This study utilizes the magnetohydrodynamics code AREPO to simulate collisions and mergers of $5$ to $10 \,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ main-sequence stars, systematically comparing the properties of the resulting products. Both collisions and mergers yield more massive, strongly magnetized, rapidly and differentially rotating stars with cores enriched in hydrogen, but notable quantitative differences emerge. Merger products exhibit core hydrogen fractions up to $10\%$ higher than those of collision products. In both scenarios, turbulent mixing amplifies magnetic field energies by $9$ to $12$ orders of magnitude. However, magnetic fields in small-impact-parameter collision products display small-scale reversals that may dissipate over time, whereas merger products and large-impact-parameter collision products develop large-scale ordered, potentially long-lived magnetic fields. Additionally, only merger products display magnetically driven, bipolar outflows with radial velocities exceeding $300$ to $400 \,\mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. These distinctions may result in divergent long-term evolutionary outcomes, which warrant further investigation in future studies.

 - **Abstract**
 Galactic cosmic rays (CRs) play a crucial role in galaxy formation and evolution by altering gas dynamics and chemistry across multiple scales. Typical numerical simulations of CR transport assume a constant diffusion coefficient for the entire galaxy, despite both numerical and theoretical studies showing that it can change by orders of magnitude depending on the phase of the interstellar medium. Only a few simulations exist that self-consistently calculate CR transport with diffusion, streaming, and advection by the background gas. In this study we explore three subgrid models for CR diffusion, based on popular theories of CR transport. We post-process an isolated, star-forming MHD galactic disk simulated using the RAMSES code. The resulting diffusion coefficients depend solely on the subgrid turbulent kinetic energy and the MHD state variables of the plasma. We use these models to calculate coefficients for vertical transport. We find that they depend critically on the local magnetic field tilt angle. Across models, our resulting diffusion coefficients range from $10^{26}~\rm cm^2s^{-1}$ to $10^{31}~\rm cm^2s^{-1}$, and yield CR energy densities at the midplane from $1$ to $100 ~\rm eV cm^{-3}$, suggesting varied degrees of backreaction on their environment. Using simple approximations, we show that the gamma ray luminosity of the galaxy depends primarily on the gas surface density and the turbulent confinement of CRs by the galactic corona.

 - **Abstract**
 A long-lived central engine embedded in expanding supernova ejecta can alter the dynamics and observational signatures of the event, producing an unusually luminous, energetic, and/or rapidly-evolving transient. We use two-dimensional hydrodynamics simulations to study the effect of a central energy source, varying the amount, rate, and isotropy of the energy deposition. We post-process the results with a time-dependent Monte Carlo radiation transport code to extract observational signatures. The engine excavates a bubble at the centre of the ejecta, which becomes Rayleigh-Taylor unstable. Sufficiently powerful engines are able to break through the edge of the bubble and accelerate, shred, and compositionally mix the entire ejecta. The breakout of the engine-driven wind occurs at distinct rupture points, and the outflowing high-velocity gas may eventually give rise to radio emission. The dynamical impact of the engine leads to faster rising optical light curves, with photon escape facilitated by the faster expansion of the ejecta and the opening of low-density channels. For models with strong engines, the spectra are initially hot and featureless, but later evolve to resemble those of broad-line Ic supernovae. Under certain conditions, line emission from ionized, low-velocity material near the centre of the ejecta may be able to escape and produce narrow emission similar to that seen in interacting supernovae. We discuss how variability in the engine energy reservoir and injection rate could give rise to a heterogeneous set of events spanning multiple observational classes, including the fast blue optical transients, broad-line Ic supernovae, and superluminous supernovae.

 - **Abstract**
 Photometric classification of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) is critical for cosmological studies but remains difficult due to class imbalance and observational noise. While deep learning models have been explored, they are often resource-intensive and lack interpretability. We present a computationally efficient and interpretable classification framework that maintains high performance on imbalanced datasets. We emphasize the use of PR-AUC and F1-score as more informative metrics than ROC-AUC in severely imbalanced settings. Using an XGBoost ensemble optimized via Bayesian hyperparameter tuning, we classified light curves from the Supernova Photometric Classification Challenge (SPCC), comprising 21,318 events with a 3.19 imbalance ratio (non-Ia to Ia). Our model achieved a PR-AUC of $0.993^{+0.03}_{-0.02}$, an F1-score of $0.923 \pm 0.008$, and a ROC-AUC of $0.976 \pm 0.004$, matching or exceeding deep learning performance on precision-recall trade-offs while using fewer resources. Despite slightly lower overall accuracy, our method balances false positives and false negatives, improving the efficiency of spectroscopic follow-up. We show that optimized ensemble models offer a reproducible and lightweight alternative to complex architectures, particularly for large-scale surveys such as the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) where transparency and efficiency are essential.

 - **Abstract**
 Double-bump showers are a rare class of extensive air showers (EAS) predicted by Monte Carlo simulations. They occur when a high-energy secondary particle, the leading particle, travels significantly farther than the rest, creating a distinct double-peaked longitudinal profile. So far, no experiment has been able to directly detect these showers. The unique radio footprint of double-bump showers, characterized by multiple Cherenkov rings, provides a way to reconstruct longitudinal profiles from radio observations. With its dense antenna array and broad frequency range, the Square Kilometer Array Observatory (SKAO) will be the first experiment capable of detecting these features, offering a new opportunity to probe hadronic interactions and constrain particle cross sections at high energies. In our analysis, we simulate the EAS using CORSIKA with the CoREAS plugin for radio. We developed a new method based on the Akaike information criterion to identify double bump showers in simulations by analyzing their longitudinal profiles. Then we investigate the prevalence of these double bump showers across different cosmic ray primary particles and various hadronic interaction models. We create a skeleton of the EAS which consists of all the particles with at least $1\%$ of the primary energy, allowing us to confirm the leading particle hypothesis and track shower development following these particles. This will enable us to relate the attributes of the leading particle to measurable parameters. Depending on the exact shower properties, the radio footprint of a double bump shower can create a complex interference pattern, consisting of multiple rings. From this information, the longitudinal profiles can be extracted. SKA due to its dense antenna array and frequency range will be the first experiment able to observe these double bump showers in detail.

 - **Abstract**
 Measuring cometary nuclei is notoriously difficult because they are usually unresolved and embedded within bright comae, which hampers direct size measurements even with space telescopes. We present a practical, instrumental method that, stabilises the inner core through bicubic resampling, performs forward point-spread function PSF+convolution, and separates the unresolved nucleus from the inner-coma profile via an explicit Dirac Delta function added to a Rho^-1 surface brightness law. The method yields the nucleus flux by fitting an azimuthal averaged profile with two amplitudes only PSF core and convolved coma, with transparent residual diagnostics. As a case study, we apply the workflow to the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS alias C/2025 N1, incorporating Hubble Space Telescope constraints on the nucleus size. We find that radius solutions consistent with 0.16 <= Rn <= 2.8 km for Pv = 0.04 are naturally recovered, in line with the most recent HST upper limits. The approach is well-suited for survey pipelines Rubin LSST and targeted follow up.

 - **Abstract**
 CD-35 2722 B is an L dwarf companion to the nearby, $\sim 50-200$ Myr old M1 dwarf CD-35 2722 A. We present a detailed analysis of both objects using high-resolution ($R \sim 35,000$) $K$ band spectroscopy from the Keck Planet Imager and Characterizer (KPIC) combined with archival photometry. With a mass of $30^{+5}_{-4} M_{\mathrm{Jup}}$ (planet-to-host mass ratio 0.05) and projected separation of $67\pm4$ AU from its host, CD-35 2722 B likely formed via gravitational instability. We explore whether the chemical composition of the system tells a similar story. Accounting for systematic uncertainties, we find $\mathrm{[M/H]}=-0.16^{+0.03}_{-0.02} \mathrm{(stat)} \pm 0.25 \mathrm{(sys)}$ dex and $^{12}\mathrm{C}/^{13}\mathrm{C}=132^{+20}_{-14}$ for the host, and $\mathrm{[M/H]}=0.27^{+0.07}_{-0.06} (\mathrm{stat}) \pm 0.12 (\mathrm{sys})$ dex, $^{12}\mathrm{CO}/^{13}\mathrm{CO}=159^{+33}_{-24} \mathrm{(stat)}^{+40}_{-33} \mathrm{(sys)}$, and $\mathrm{C/O} = 0.55 \pm 0.01 (\mathrm{stat}) \pm 0.04 (\mathrm{sys})$ for the companion. The chemical compositions for the brown dwarf and host star agree within the $1.5\sigma$ level, supporting a scenario where CD-35 2722 B formed via gravitational instability. We do not find evidence for clouds on CD-35 2722 B despite it being a photometrically red mid-L dwarf and thus expected to be quite cloudy. We retrieve a temperature structure which is more isothermal than models and investigate its impact on our measurements, finding that constraining the temperature structure to self-consistent models does not significantly impact our retrieved chemical properties. Our observations highlight the need for data from complementary wavelength ranges to verify the presence of aerosols in likely cloudy L dwarfs.

 - **Abstract**
 The Changing-Look active galactic nucleus Mkn 590 is currently in a rejuvenated state, exhibiting a contemporaneous flux rise across X-rays, UV, optical and cm wavelengths. In this study, we present three new optical spectra obtained with the Nordic Optical Telescope, alongside three 1.4 GHz continuum measurements from the Giant Meterwave Radio Telescope, acquired since Nov. 2024. We identified a clear increase in the broad hydrogen Balmer line emission in the most recent observational epochs. Additionally, the core radio flux densities appear to track the overall X-ray variability, suggesting a possible connection between the accretion flow and jet activity. Based on these data, we aim to explore the evolution of the circumnuclear gas in this source and potential links between accretion and ejection activity.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the origin of the scatter in the stellar mass-halo mass (SMHM) relation using the \colibre cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. At fixed halo mass, we find a clear positive correlation between stellar mass and halo concentration, particularly in low-mass haloes between $10^{11}$ and $10^{12}\,\rm M_\odot$, where all halo properties are computed from the corresponding dark-matter-only simulation. Two scenarios have been proposed to explain this trend: the earlier formation of higher-concentration haloes allows more time for star formation, or the deeper gravitational potential wells of higher-concentration haloes enhance baryon retention. To distinguish between them, we examine correlations between halo concentration, stellar mass, stellar age, and stellar metallicity. While, at fixed halo mass, halo concentration correlates with stellar age, stellar age itself shows only a weak correlation with stellar mass, indicating that early formation alone cannot account for the concentration-dependence in the scatter of the SMHM relation. In contrast, both stellar metallicity and halo concentration exhibit correlations with stellar mass. The connection between halo concentration and stellar metallicity persists even when simultaneously controlling for both halo mass and stellar mass. These results support the scenario in which the deeper gravitational potentials in higher-concentration haloes suppress feedback-driven outflows, thereby enhancing both baryon and metal retention.

 - **Abstract**
 Eruptions of filaments are defined by different parameters, specially, sigmoid handedness and direction of the eruption, which are important parameters for forecasting the geoeffectiveness of consequent interplanetary coronal mass ejection (ICME) or magnetic cloud. Solar filaments often exhibit rotation and deflection during eruptions, which would significantly affect the geoeffectiveness of the coronal mass ejections (CMEs). Therefore, understanding the mechanisms that lead to such lateral displacement of filaments is a great concern to space weather forecasting. Two case studies are discussed. Firstly, the events of September 8 and September 10 2014, were analyzed from the Sun to the Earth. The numerical heliospheric simulation EUHFORIA shows that the handedness of the EUV sigmoid deduced from coronagraph observations was different from the tilt of the ICME at 1~au, suggesting a rotation of the CME in the low corona. A potential undetected low coronal rotation led to erroneous space weather prediction. The second event concerns a filament observed on August 20 2021, which underwent a rotation of 73 degrees during its eruption, implying a significant lateral drifting of the filament material. A data-constrained magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulation confirms such a rotation. These two studies reinforce the idea that CMEs are subjected to more significant rotation and deflection in the low corona than during their journey in the heliosphere.

 - **Abstract**
 We characterize star-forming gas in six molecular clouds (Sgr B1-off, Sgr B2, Sgr C, the 20 km s$^{-1}$ and 50 km s$^{-1}$ molecular clouds, and the Brick) in the Galactic central molecular zone (CMZ), and compare their star-forming activities with those in molecular clouds outside the CMZ. Using multi-band continuum observations taken from ${\it Planck}$, ${\it Herschel}$, JCMT/SCUBA-2, and CSO/SHARC2, we derived 8.5" resolution column density maps for the CMZ clouds and evaluated the column density probability distribution functions (N-PDFs). With the archival Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) 1.3 mm dust continuum data, we further evaluated the mass of the most massive cores ($M_{\rm core}^{\rm ma x}$). We find that the N-PDFs of four of the selected CMZ clouds are well described by a piecewise log-normal + power-law function, while the N-PDFs of the remaining two can be approximated by log-normal functions. In the first four targets, the masses in the power-law component ($M_{\rm gas}^{\rm bound}$), $M_{\rm core}^{\rm max}$, and star formation rate (SFR) are correlated. These correlations are very similar to those derived from low-mass clouds in the Solar neighborhood and massive star-forming regions on the Galactic disk. These findings lead to our key hypotheses: (1) In the extreme environment of the CMZ, the power-law component in the N-PDF also represents self-gravitationally bound gas structures, and (2) evolution and star-forming activities of self-gravitationally bound gas structures may be self-regulated, insensitive to the exterior environment on $\gtrsim$5-10 pc scales.
#### Molecular hydrogen in filaments at high Galactic latitudes

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Neutral atomic hydrogen (HI) absorption lines can be used to probe the cold neutral medium (CNM) at high Galactic latitudes. Cold HI with a significant optical depth from the GASKAP-HI survey is found to be located predominantly if not exclusively within filamentary structures that can be identified as caustics with the Hessian operator. Most of these HI filaments (57%) are also observable in the far-infrared (FIR) and trace the orientation of magnetic field lines. Aims. We considered whether molecular hydrogen (H2) might also be preferentially associated with CNM filaments. Methods. We analyzed 241 H2 absorption lines against stars and determined whether the lines of sight intersected HI or FIR filaments. Using Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE) H2 data in the velocity range -50 < vLSR < 50 km/s, we traced 65 additional H2 lines for filamentary HI and FIR structures in velocity and probed the H2 absorption for coincidences in position and velocity. Results. For 305 out of 306 positions, the lines of sight with H2 absorption intersect HI filaments. In 120 cases, there is also evidence for a correlation with dusty FIR filaments. All of the 65 available sight lines with known velocities intersect HI filaments. In 64 cases, the H2 velocities are consistent with HI filament velocities. For FIR filaments, an agreement is found for only 13 out of 14 H2 absorption lines. Conclusions. For the majority of H2 absorption lines, there is evidence that H2 is associated with cold HI filaments. Evidence of an association with FIR filaments is less compelling. Confusion along the line of sight limits the detectability of FIR filaments. For a comparable degree of UV excitation in the disk and lower Galactic halo, the formation rate of H2 appears to be enhanced in HI filaments with increased CNM densities.

 - **Abstract**
 Comet Interceptor is an ESA science mission with payload contributions from ESA Member States and with an international participation by JAXA. It is the first mission that is being designed, built, and potentially launched before its target is known. This approach will enable the spacecraft to perform the first mission to a Long Period Comet from the Oort Cloud, as these comets have fleeting visits to the inner Solar System lasting only months to years from first discovery, too short for the usual process of mission development to be followed. In this paper we describe a number of factors that need to be considered in selecting a target for the mission, including scientific, orbital, spacecraft and instrument constraints, and discussion of different prioritisation strategies. We find that, in the case where we have a choice of targets, our decisions will mostly be driven by orbital information, which we will have relatively early on, with information on the activity level of the comet an important but secondary consideration. As cometary activity levels are notoriously hard to predict based on early observations alone, this prioritisation / decision approach based more on orbits gives us confidence that a good comet that is compatible with the spacecraft constraints will be selectable with sufficient warning time to allow the mission to intercept it.

 - **Abstract**
 Massive stars (mass beyond 8 solMass) release vast amounts of energy into the interstellar medium through their stellar winds, photoionising radiation and supernova explosions. These processes may compress nearby regions, triggering further star formation, but the significance of triggered star formation across the Galactic disc is not well understood. This pilot study combines 1.3 GHz continuum data from the South African Radio Astronomy Observatory (SARAO) MeerKAT Galactic Plane Survey (SMGPS) with 13CO (2-1) data from the Structure, Excitation, and Dynamics of the Inner Galactic Interstellar Medium (SEDIGISM) survey to identify and examine molecular clouds associated with H II regions and supernovae remnants (SNRs). We focus on their physical properties and massive star formation potential. We identify 268 molecular clouds from the SEDIGISM tile covering the Galactic plane region between 341 and 343 longitude deg and latitude deg equal to or less 0.5, of which 90 clouds (34 per cent) are associated with SMGPS extended sources. Compared to unassociated clouds, we find that associated clouds exhibit significantly higher mean mass (9600 solMass vs. 2500 solMass ) and average gas surface density (104 solMass / pc^2 vs. 67 solMass / pc^2 ), and slightly elevated but comparable virial parameters. We also find that the size-linewidth scaling relation is steeper for associated clouds compared to unassociated clouds. In addition, radio luminosity shows a positive correlation with total complex mass, and the ratio L_radio/L_complex increases with source size, consistent with an evolutionary sequence where expanding H II regions progressively disrupt their natal molecular environment. These findings suggest an enhanced dynamical activity for the associated clouds and support the hypothesis that feedback from massive stars influences molecular cloud properties and may trigger star formation.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the origin of unidentified, extended TeV source 1LHAASO J0500$+$4454, considering three possible origins: cosmic rays interacting with a molecular cloud (MC), particles accelerated in a currently undetected supernova remnant (SNR), and an energetic outflow powered by a pulsar. Upper limits on the CO and X-ray emission from the $\gamma$-ray emitting region disfavor the MC and SNR scenarios, respectively. If a nebula of inverse Compton scattering $e^{\pm}$ powers 1LHAASO J0500$+$4454, then SED modeling indicates that the current particle energy in the nebula is $\sim 4 \times 10^{48}$ erg. If the coincident magnetar SGR 0501$+$4516's rotational energy powered 1LHAASO J0500$+$4454, then a conservative energy budget calculation requires an initial magnetar spin period $P_{0} \lesssim 5$ ms and a spin-down timescale $\tau_{\rm sd} \lesssim 30$ yr, which has implications for the origins of magnetars.

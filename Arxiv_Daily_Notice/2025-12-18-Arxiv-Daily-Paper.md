 - **Abstract**
 The ESA Gaia mission has revolutionized our understanding of the white dwarf population, delivering an unprecedented census of these nearby remnants and revealing previously unseen structures in the Hertzsprung-Russell (HR) diagram. However, while Gaia has expanded the scope of white dwarf astrophysics, it has also exposed new questions related to atmospheric composition, spectral evolution, crystallization, magnetism, and merger-driven pathways. Many of these open problems are encoded in the detailed morphology of the Gaia HR diagram, where precise spectroscopic characterization is essential for interpreting the underlying physical processes. Spectroscopic characterization, obtainable with current and future ESO facilities, can provide the effective temperatures and surface gravities that are required to derive accurate white dwarf masses, cooling ages, and luminosities. These fundamental parameters not only enable studies of spectral evolution, interior physics, and the origin of magnetic and high-mass white dwarfs, but also guarantee the construction of robust mass distributions and luminosity functions, essential for constraining the initial-to-final mass relation, probing the initial mass function, and reconstructing the star formation history of the local Galaxy, among other applications. Looking toward the 2040s, future multi-fiber spectrographs operating in survey mode on 10--15 meter class telescopes will be able to collect a complete spectroscopic sample of white dwarf, enabling the detailed characterization of their population. Achieving spectroscopic completeness for the nearby Galactic population and securing high signal-to-noise, moderate-to-high resolution spectra across the HR diagram with ESO instrumentation will be critical steps toward resolving these longstanding questions in white dwarf astrophysics.

 - **Abstract**
 The detection and characterization of protoplanets in protoplanetary disks around young stars is emerging as a transformative field that will redefine our understanding of how planetary systems form. While current facilities have revealed the diversity of mature exoplanets and the complex structures of disks, we still lack the crucial observational link between them: a statistically meaningful census of planets caught in the act of formation. This white paper argues that such a breakthrough requires access to the nearest and most informative star-forming regions, roughly half of which are poorly accessible or entirely unreachable from Cerro Armazones. Although the ELT alone will strongly impact our knowledge of planet formation, its location prevents Europe from fully exploiting the necessary parameter space. A 30-40 m telescope in the northern hemisphere is therefore essential for obtaining diffraction-limited imaging of protoplanets and disks across the entire sky, enabling robust demographics, exploiting synergies with ngVLA, Gaia, and other facilities covering the north, and ensuring that Europe remains at the forefront of the planet-formation revolution in the coming decades.

 - **Abstract**
 White dwarf binaries are fundamental astrophysical probes. They represent ideal laboratories to test the models of binary evolution, which also apply to the sources of gravitational waves, whose detection led to the award of the 2017 Nobel Prize in Physics. Moreover, their final fate is intimately linked to Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia), i.e. the thermonuclear explosion of a white dwarf following the interaction with a companion star, which have become the fundamental yardsticks on cosmological distance scales and led to the discovery of dark energy and the award of the 2011 Nobel Prize in Physics. Finally, white dwarf binaries play a crucial role in influencing star formation and chemical evolution of the Galaxy by injecting energy into, and enriching, the interstellar medium with material ejected during nova eruptions and SN Ia explosions. In the next decade, the advent of the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) at the Vera Rubin Observatory will lead to the discovery of hundreds of thousands of white dwarf binaries. Nonetheless, the intrinsic faintness of the majority of these systems will prevent their spectroscopic characterisation with the instruments available in the 2030s. Hence ESO's Expanding Horizons call is timely for planning a future transformative facility, capable of delivering phase-resolved spectroscopic observations of faint white dwarf binaries, which are key to advancing our understanding of stellar and Galactic evolution and cosmology.

 - **Abstract**
 In 2023, after more than two decades of searching, pulsar timing array (PTA) collaborations around the world announced evidence for a stochastic gravitational wave background. It was quickly followed by work from the International Pulsar Timing Array (IPTA), demonstrating that the results of regional collaborations were consistent with each other. The combination of these datasets is still ongoing and represents a significant investment of time and expertise. In that IPTA comparison, authors of this letter combined the separate datasets in the standard PTA optimal detection statistic for cross-correlations incoherently, that is, the data was combined without fitting a merged timing model across all PTA datasets, treating datasets of the same pulsar as independent, and neglecting the "same pulsar, different datasets" cross-correlations. This work refines that method by extending its core ideas beyond detection statistics and into a full, general data-combination method. We have demonstrated its efficacy and extreme efficiency on simulated data. This new method, \textit{FrankenStat}, is very similar in sensitivity and parameter-constraining power to traditional data combination methods while completing the full data combination in just a few minutes.
#### A milli-Tidal Disruption Event Model for GRB$\;$250702B: Main Sequence Star Disrupted by an IMBH

 - **Abstract**
 GRB$\;$250702B is the longest GRB recorded so far, with multiple gamma-ray emission episodes spread over a duration exceeding $25\;$ks and a weaker soft X-ray pre-peak $\sim1\;$day gradually rising emission. It is offset from its host galaxy center by $\sim5.7\;$kpc, and displays a long-lived afterglow emission in radio to X-ray. Its true nature is unclear, with the two leading candidate classes of objects being a peculiar type of ultra-long GRB and a tidal disruption event (TDE) by an intermediate mass black hole (IMBH). Here, we consider the latter, mTDE origin. We model the afterglow data, finding a stratified external density profile $\propto r^{-k}$ with $k=1.60\pm0.17$, consistent with Bondi accretion of the interstellar medium (of initial number density $n_{\rm ISM}=n_0\;{\rm cm^{-3}}$ and sound speed $c_s=c_{s,6}10^6\;{\rm cm\,s^{-1}}$) for which $n(r)\approx n_{\rm ISM}(r/R_{\rm B})^{-3/2}$ within the Bondi radius $R_{\rm B}$. Moreover, we use the implied density normalization to infer the IMBH mass within this model, finding $M_\bullet\approx\left(6.55^{+3.51}_{-2.29}\right)\times10^3\,n_0^{-2/3}\,c_{s,6}^{2}(1+\mathcal{M}^2)\;M_\odot$ where $\mathcal{M}\equiv v_{\rm BH}/c_s$ is the IMBH's Mach number relative to the ISM. Together with an upper limit on $M_\bullet<\frac{c^3}{G}\frac{t_{\rm MV}}{1+z} \lesssim5\times10^4\,M_\odot$ from the source-frame minimum variability time $t_{\rm MV,src}\!=\!\frac{t_{\rm MV}}{1+z}\!\approx\!0.5\;$s this implies $v_{\rm BH}\lesssim 28\,n_0^{1/3}\;{\rm km\;s^{-1}}$. We show that a mTDE of a main-sequence star (but not of a white dwarf) can explain the duration and energetics of GRB$\;$250702B. The gradual rise to the peak may be caused by gradual circularization and accretion disk buildup, leading to an increase in the jet's power and Lorentz factor.

 - **Abstract**
 Extended radio continuum emission and its linear polarization play a key role in probing large-scale structures of synchrotron and free-free emission in the Milky Way. Despite the existence of many radio continuum surveys, sensitive and high-angular-resolution single-dish surveys of extended radio continuum emission remain scarce. As part of the GLObal view of STAR formation (GLOSTAR) survey, we will also crucially complement the existing data from the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) by addressing the missing zero-spacing gap. Within the framework of the GLOSTAR Galactic plane survey, we performed large-scale radio continuum imaging observations toward the Galactic plane in the range $-2^{\circ}< \ell <60^{\circ}$ and $|b|<1.1^{\circ}$, as well as the Cygnus X region with the Effelsberg 100-m radio telescope. We present the Effelsberg continuum survey at 4.89GHz and 6.82GHz including linear polarization with angular resolutions of 145$^{\prime\prime}$ and 106$^{\prime\prime}$, respectively. The survey has been corrected for missing large-scale emission using available low-angular-resolution surveys. Comparison with previous single-dish surveys indicates that our continuum survey represents the highest-quality single-dish data collected to date at this frequency. More than 90\% of the flux density missed by the VLA D-array data is effectively recovered by the Effelsberg continuum survey. The improved sensitivity and angular resolution of our survey enable reliable mapping of Galactic magnetic field structures, with polarization data that are less affected by depolarization than in previous surveys. The GLOSTAR single-dish continuum data will be released publicly, offering a valuable resource for studying extended objects including HII regions, supernova remnants, diffuse interstellar medium, and Galactic structure.

 - **Abstract**
 We conduct a systematic robustness analysis of the hybrid machine learning framework \texttt{USmorph}, which integrates unsupervised and supervised learning for galaxy morphological classification. Although \texttt{USmorph} has already been applied to nearly 100,000 $I$-band galaxy images in the COSMOS field ($0.2 < z < 1.2$, $I_{\mathrm{mag}} < 25$), the stability of its core modules has not been quantitatively assessed. Our tests show that the convolutional autoencoder (CAE) achieves the best performance in preserving structural information when adopting an intermediate network depth, $5\times5$ convolutional kernels, and a 40-dimensional latent representation. The adaptive polar coordinate transform (APCT) effectively enhances rotational invariance and improves the robustness of downstream tasks. In the unsupervised stage, a bagging clustering number of $K=50$ provides the optimal trade-off between classification granularity and labeling efficiency. For supervised learning, we employ GoogLeNet, which exhibits stable performance without overfitting. We validate the reliability of the final classifications through two independent tests: (1) the t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) visualization reveals clear clustering boundaries in the low-dimensional space; and (2) the morphological classifications are consistent with theoretical expectations of galaxy evolution, with both true and false positives showing unbiased distributions in the parameter space. These results demonstrate the strong robustness of the \texttt{USmorph} algorithm, providing guidance for its future application to the China Space Station Telescope (CSST) mission.
#### Thermal properties of interplanetary coronal mass ejections at 1 AU and their connection to geoeffectiveness across solar cycles 23-25

 - **Abstract**
 Interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs) are major drivers of heliospheric variability and can produce prolonged disturbances near Earth. Understanding their thermodynamic evolution is crucial for assessing their heat budget and exploring how thermal states relate to their plasma dynamics and geoeffectiveness. We conduct a comprehensive statistical analysis of magnetic ejecta (MEs) over Solar Cycles 23, 24, and the ascending phase of 25. Leveraging a polytropic framework, we characterized the thermal state of ME based on the event-wise median proton polytropic index (Gamma_p) from in-situ measurements at 1 AU. We find that MEs are thermodynamically active and rarely evolve adiabatically or isothermally. Notably, a significant fraction (45%) of MEs exhibit a heating state. Heating MEs dominate near solar maxima and exhibit strong solar-cycle modulation in Gamma_p, proton temperature, and expansion speed, indicating active in-transit heating processes. Whereas, Cooling MEs show a nearly constant Gamma_p = 2 across cycles, suggesting enhanced cooling beyond adiabatic expectations and possible thermal energy retention from eruption to 1 AU. Notably, the median Gamma_p value increases from 1.49 (SC23) to 1.88 (SC24), indicating a shift to cooling-dominated states over successive cycles. High-impact ICMEs, predominantly Heating MEs (Gamma_p = 0.59), often manifest as magnetic clouds with enhanced magnetic fields, low plasma beta, pronounced sheath compression, elevated expansion, and post-ICME high-speed flows, making them the most geoeffective drivers of strong geomagnetic storms. These results establish Gamma_p as a useful diagnostic of ICME thermal states, though meaningful assessment of geoeffectiveness requires combined consideration of thermal, plasma, and magnetic field properties.
#### Time Evolution of Optical Darkness in GRB Afterglow: The Case of GRB 240825A

 - **Abstract**
 Long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are believed to occur in star-forming regions. The multiwavelength follow-up observations of the early afterglow of GRB 240825A provided insights into the evolution of the optical-to-X-ray spectral feature of the afterglow. We comprehensively investigate the evolution of X-ray spectral properties through time-resolved spectral analysis and calculate optical darkness ($\beta_\mathrm{OX}$) to reveal the physical properties of the afterglow. The X-ray-to-optical SEDs of afterglow in different time intervals are fitted to derive the extinction curves. The $\beta_\mathrm{OX}$ exhibits a trend of decreasing and then increasing, reaching its minimum value at $\sim1000\mathrm{\,s}$ post-trigger. However, at 11 hours post-trigger, $\beta_\mathrm{OX}$ does not meet the criteria for an optically dark burst. The extinction curves in different time intervals indicate that GRB 240825A occurred in a dust-obscured environment.

 - **Abstract**
 Determining the prevalence of atmospheres on terrestrial planets is a core objective in exoplanetary science. While M dwarf systems offer a promising opportunity, conclusive observations of terrestrial atmospheres have remained elusive, with many yielding flat transmission spectra. We observe four transits of the hot terrestrial planet TOI-1685 b using JWST's NIRSpec G395H instrument. Combining this with the transit from the previously-observed phase curve of the planet with the same instrument, we perform a detailed analysis to determine the possibility of an atmosphere on TOI-1685 b. From our retrievals, the Bayesian evidence favours a simple flat line model, indicating no evidence for an atmosphere on TOI-1685 b, in line with results from the phase curve analysis. Our results show that hydrogen-dominated atmospheres can be confidently ruled out. For heavier, secondary atmospheres we find a lower limit on the mean molecular weight of ~10, at a significance of ~5 sigma. Pure CO2, SO2, H2O, and CH4 atmospheres, or a mixed secondary atmosphere (CO+CO2+SO2) could explain the data (Delta lnZ < 3). However, pure CH4 atmospheres may be physically unlikely, and the pure H2O and CO2 cases require a high-altitude cloud, which could also be interpreted as a thin cloud-free atmosphere. We discuss the theoretical possibility for different types of atmosphere on this planet, and consider the effects of atmospheric escape and stellar activity on the system. Though we find that TOI-1685 b is likely a bare rock, this study also highlights the challenges of detecting secondary atmospheres on rocky planets with JWST.
#### Extensive Observational Evidence for Massive Star Stellar Wind Variability at Low Metallicities: implications for mass-loss rate determination

 - **Abstract**
 Mass-loss from massive stars is fundamental to stellar and galactic evolution and enrichment of the interstellar medium. Reliable determination of mass-loss rate is dependent upon unravelling details of massive star outflows, including optical depth structure of the stellar wind. That parameter introduces significant uncertainty due to the nearly ubiquitous presence of large-scale optically thick wind structure. We utilize suitable available ultraviolet spectra of 20 Large and Small Magellanic Cloud (LMC, SMC) OB stars to extend existing Galactic results quantifying uncertainty inherent in individual observations to lower metallicity environments. This is achieved by measuring standard deviations of mean optical depths of multiple observations of suitable wind-formed absorption profiles as a proportion of their mean optical depths. We confirm earlier findings that wind structure is prevalent at low metallicities and demonstrate that quantifying the consequent uncertainty is to some extent possible, despite the near-complete absence of time series UV spectroscopic observations in those environments. We find that the uncertainty inherent in any single observation of stellar wind optical depth at low metallicity is of similar magnitude to that already identified at Galactic metallicity (up to 45% for cooler OB stars). We further demonstrate how the effect of varying narrow absorption components in wind-formed UV spectral profiles is unlikely to be properly accounted for in existing mass-loss models. We present further evidence of a binary companion to the SMC O-type giant star AzV 75. The importance of obtaining high cadence multi-epoch, or genuine time series, UV spectroscopic observations at low metallicities is highlighted.
#### Searching potential astronomical sites in Ethiopia

 - **Abstract**
 This work aims to choose potential astronomical sites that can be candidates for a new astronomical optical observatory in Ethiopia, in addition to the Entoto Observatory and Lalibela sites. For our primary investigation, the six basic criteria, namely the altitude of the mountains, artificial light pollution, cloud coverage, humidity, wind speed, and wind direction, are taken into account. Consequently, using the multi-criteria statistical analysis (MCSA) techniques, 21 high-potential places are selected and presented for further investigation out of 367 mountains. Those selected mountains are mapped and presented to study the future of the astronomical seeing effect. This study may contribute to the protection of those potential astronomical sites and their dark skies and the development of astrotourism for the sustainable development of modern astronomy in Ethiopia and in the East African region.
#### Structure of Jupiter's High-Latitude Storms: Folded Filamentary Regions Revealed by Juno

 - **Abstract**
 Sprawling, turbulent cloud formations dominate the meteorology of Jupiter's mid-to-high latitudes, known as Folded Filamentary Regions (FFRs). A multi-wavelength characterisation by Juno reveals the spatial distribution, vertical structure, and energetics of the FFRs. The cloud tops display multiple lobes of stratiform aerosols, separated by darker, cloud-free lanes, and embedded with smaller eddies and high-altitude cumulus clouds. These cyclonic FFRs are microwave-bright in shallow-sounding wavelengths ($p<5$ bars) and microwave-dark in deep-sounding wavelengths ($p>10$ bars), with the transition potentially associated with the water condensation layer (6-7 bars). Associating microwave contrasts with temperature anomalies, this implies despinning of cyclonic eddies above/below their mid-planes. Despite deep roots (being detectable in wavelengths sounding $\sim100$ bars), they are ``pancake vortices'' with horizontal extents at least an order of magnitude larger than their depth. In the northern hemisphere, FFRs are most common in cyclonic belts poleward of $40^\circ$N (all latitudes are planetocentric), particularly a North Polar Filamentary Belt (NPFB) near $66-70^\circ$N that defines the transition from organised belts/zones to the chaotic polar domain. This distribution explains the high lightning rates from $45-80^\circ$N, peaking in a belt poleward of $52.3^\circ$N, which may trace the availability of water for moist convection. Many observed lightning flashes can be associated to specific FFRs containing bright storms, but some FFRs display no activity, suggesting quiescent periods during storm evolution. Analogies to Earth's oceanic eddies suggest that cyclones deform isentropic surfaces at their midplanes, raising deep water-rich layers upwards to promote moist convection, release latent heat, and inject clouds into the upper troposphere.

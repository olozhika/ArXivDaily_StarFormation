 - **Abstract**
 Supersonic flows are ubiquitous in warm and cool media; their dissipation leads to heating, generation of nonthermal particles, and amplification of background magnetic fields. We present 2D hybrid (kinetic ions - fluid electrons) simulations of decaying shear flows across the subsonic-to-supersonic transition, finding that the canonical Kelvin-Helmholtz instability in subsonic cases gives way to the formation of shocklets in supersonic shears, where dissipation is faster and nonthermal particles are produced. We discuss the dependence on the flow Mach number of particle acceleration, the viscosity induced by kinetic effects, and the production of magnetic turbulence. We outline the potential impact of these findings for turbulence in the warm interstellar medium, for molecular clouds, and for accretion disks, leaving to a companion paper the discussion of the effects on the shear of self-generated and pre-existing energetic particles.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. The fragmentation of massive molecular clumps into smaller, potentially star-forming cores plays a key role in the processes of high-mass star formation. The ALMAGAL project offers high-resolution data to investigate these processes across various evolutionary stages in the Galactic plane. Aims. This study aims at correlating the fragmentation properties of massive clumps, obtained from ALMA observations, with their global physical parameters (e.g., mass, surface density, and temperature) and evolutionary indicators (such as luminosity-to-mass ratio and bolometric temperature) obtained from Herschel observations. It seeks to assess whether the cores evolve in number and mass in tandem with their host clumps, and to determine the possible factors influencing the formation of massive cores (M > 24M_\odot). Methods. We analyzed the masses of 6348 fragments, estimated from 1.4 mm continuum data for 1007 ALMAGAL clumps. Leveraging this unprecedentedly large data set, we evaluated statistical relationships between clump parameters, estimated over about 0.1 pc scales, and fragment properties, corresponding to scales of a few 1000 au, while accounting for potential biases related to distance and observational resolution. Our results were further compared with predictions from numerical simulations. Results. The fragmentation level correlates preferentially with clump surface density, supporting a scenario of density-driven fragmentation, whereas it does not show any clear dependence on total clump mass. Both the mass of the most massive core and the core formation efficiency show a broad range and increase on average by an order of magnitude in the intervals spanned by evolutionary indicators such as clump dust temperature and the luminosity-to-mass ratio. This suggests that core growth continues throughout the clump evolution, favoring clump-fed over core-fed theoretical scenarios.

 - **Abstract**
 It has been proposed that radio pulsars can be distinguished from other point-like radio sources in continuum images by their unique interstellar scintillation signatures. Using data from the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) Evolutionary Map of the Universe (EMU) survey, we conducted a pilot survey of radio pulsars at high Galactic latitude regions via the variance imaging method. Out of approximately 59,800 compact radio sources detected in a ~480 square degree survey area, we identified 20 highly variable sources. Among them, 9 are known pulsars, 1 is a known radio star, 1 is an ultra-long period source, 3 are radio star candidates, and the remaining 6 are pulsar candidates. Notably, we discovered two strongly scintillating pulsars: one with a period of 85.707 ms and a dispersion measure (DM) of 19.4 pc/cm^3, and another with a period of 5.492 ms and a DM of 29.5 pc/cm^3. In addition, a third pulsar was discovered in the variance images, with a period of 14.82 ms and a DM of 39.0 pc/cm^3. This source shows a steep radio spectrum and a high degree of circular polarisation. These results underscore the strong potential of variance imaging for pulsar detection in full EMU and future radio continuum surveys planned with Square Kilometre Array (SKA).
#### Discovery of an X-ray bridge between the comma-shaped gas and the main cluster in MCXC J0157.4-0550

 - **Abstract**
 We report the discovery of a faint X-ray bridge connecting between the comma-shaped gas and the main cluster in MCXC J0157.4-0550, using {\it XMM-Newton} image. The filamentary structure is found in a model-independent manner in both topological features and Gaussian Gradient Magnitude filtering. The X-ray surface brightness profile perpendicular to the filament is detected at a $5.5\sigma$ level. Weak-lensing (WL) analysis using the Subaru/HSC-SSP Survey archive data strongly supports the two mass components. Given a prior from the stellar masses, we obtain $M_{200}^{\rm main}=2.68_{-0.92}^{+1.11}\times 10^{14}\,h_{70}^{-1}M_\odot$ and $M_{200}^{\rm sub}=0.46_{-0.22}^{+0.38}\times 10^{14}\,h_{70}^{-1}M_\odot$. The main axis of the projected halo distribution is more likely to align with the direction of the main cluster than to be oriented perpendicularly. Similar X-ray distributions have been identified in the literature on numerical simulations. The filamentary structure forms in the following manner: as the gas is stripped by ram pressure near the pericenter, it gets dragged by tidal rotation. Once free from this rotation, the gas moves inertially in a direction parallel to the tangential velocity at the pericenter. The comma-shaped gas, with tails pointing in the opposite direction to the main cluster, is also formed by the current tidal rotation as it moves away from the main cluster. This warrants us that, although it is sometimes thought based on the X-ray morphology alone that the tail is pointing in the opposite direction to the merger motion, this is not necessarily the case. The information of the X-ray filamentary remnant from the cluster merger, together with the 2D WL shear data, provides constraints on the merger parameters, indicating an infalling velocity of approximately $1000\, {\rm km\, s^{-1}}$ and an impact parameter of $0.9$ Mpc.
#### Highly Polarized Intrinsic Emission and its Orthogonal Counterpart in Vela X-1

 - **Abstract**
 Vela X-1 is one of the most archetypal wind-fed X-ray pulsars (XRPs), and the emergence of its orthogonal polarization states reveals distinctive polarimetric properties. Using data from Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) observations of Vela X-1, we perform a polarization analysis of Vela X-1 using a triple power-law spectral model absorbed by varying column densities, successfully isolating two physically distinct orthogonal polarized components. The first polarized component corresponds to emission from the accretion mound surface that is not obscured by the wind clumps, with its polarization degree (PD) exceeding 30\%. In specific phase intervals, the PD reaches \(50.9 \pm 10.7\%\). This marks the first detection of such highly polarized neutron star emission in an XRP. The second polarized component likely originates from complex physical processes within or near the accretion mound, with its PD showing a potential negative correlation with column density. Furthermore, by rotating the predicted polarization angle (PA) of the first polarized component by 90$^\circ$, we successfully achieve separate fitting and simultaneous fitting of the two orthogonal polarization states using the rotating vector model (RVM).

 - **Abstract**
 We examine the spatial distribution of star clusters in NGC 628 using the statistical tool INDICATE to quantify clustering tendencies. Our sample, based on HST and JWST observations, is the most complete to date, spanning ages from 1 Myr to >100 Myr. We find cluster spatial behaviour varies with galactic position, age, and mass. Most emerging young clusters are tightly spatially associated with each other, while fully emerged clusters are in \sim1.5 times looser spatial associations, irrespective of age. Young Massive Clusters (YMCs \ge 10^4 M_{\odot}) tend to associate with lower-mass clusters but not strongly with other YMCs, implying that intense star formation regions produce a few YMCs alongside many lower-mass clusters rather than multiple YMCs together. Young concentrated clusters show a wide radial distribution in the galactic disk, which narrows with age; with concentrated clusters >100 Myr mostly residing between 2-6 kpc. This pattern may reflect either faster dispersal of isolated tight cluster spatial "structure" in a lower gas density outer disk or gradual inside-out growth, with the formation of this structure shifting outward over time. We also detect distinct spatial behaviours for clusters within 2 kpc, linked to the inner Lindblad resonance (\le1 kpc), nuclear ring (\sim0.5-1 kpc), and the start of spiral arms (\sim1.25-2 kpc), suggesting these regions exhibit strong radial motions that could hinder clusters from forming and remaining in tight concentrations. Our results highlight how spatially-resolved studies of clusters can reveal the influence of galactic dynamics on star formation and cluster evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmological simulations find that pockets of star-forming gas could remain pristine up until the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) due to the inhomogeneous nature of metal mixing and enrichment in the early Universe. Such pristine clouds could have formed Population III stars, which could have distinct properties compared to their very high redshift ($z \geq 20$) counterparts. We investigate how Population III stars form and grow during the EoR, and whether the resulting mass distribution varies with environment or across cosmic time. We perform high-resolution ($7.5\,\rm{au}$) radiation-magnetohydrodynamics simulations of identical primordial clouds exposed to the CMB appropriate for $z=30$ and $z=6$, respectively, as part of the POPSICLE project. We also run a simulation at $z=6$ with a strong external Lyman-Werner (LW) background, to span across radiative environments which could host metal-free clumps during the EoR. In the limit of no external LW radiation, we find that while the evolution of the most massive star ($M_{\star} \approx 70\,\rm{M_{\odot}}$) is almost identical between $z=30$ and $z=6$, the latter exhibits less fragmentation, leading to a smaller cluster of stars with a higher median stellar mass. In the limit of high external LW radiation, we see vigorous accretion and high star formation efficiencies, leading to the formation of very massive ($M_{\star} > 100\,\rm{M_{\odot}}$) stars. Our results suggest that Population III IMF could vary with redshift simply due to the CMB, independent of the environment. We find that less massive and more compact Pop III star clusters could form during the EoR as compared to $z \geq 20$, with the formation of very massive and supermassive stars likely in strongly irradiated environments.

 - **Abstract**
 We present pkdgrav3, a high-performance, fully parallel tree-SPH code designed for large-scale hydrodynamic simulations including self-gravity. Building upon the long development history of pkdgrav, the code combines an efficient hierarchical tree algorithm for gravity and neighbor finding with a modern implementation of Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) optimized for massively parallel hybrid CPU/GPU architectures. Its hybrid shared/distributed memory model, combined with an asynchronous communication scheme, allows pkdgrav3 to scale efficiently to thousands of CPU cores and GPUs. We validate the numerical accuracy of pkdgrav3 using a suite of standard tests, demonstrating excellent agreement with analytic or reference solutions. The code was already used in several peer-reviewed publications to model planetary-scale impacts, where SPH's Lagrangian nature allows accurate tracking of material origin and thermodynamic evolution. These examples highlight pkdgrav3's robustness and efficiency in simulating highly dynamical, self-gravitating systems. pkdgrav3 thus provides a powerful, flexible, and scalable platform for astrophysical and planetary applications, capable of exploiting the full potential of modern heterogeneous high-performance computing systems.

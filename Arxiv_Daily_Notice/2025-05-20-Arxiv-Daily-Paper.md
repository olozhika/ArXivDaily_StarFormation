 - **Abstract**
 Neutrinos experience collective flavor conversion in extreme astrophysical environments such as core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe). One manifestation of collective conversion is slow flavor conversion (SFC), which has recently attracted renewed interest owing to its ubiquity across different regions of the supernova environment. In this study, we systematically examine the evolution of kinematic decoherence in a dense neutrino gas undergoing SFC, considering lepton number asymmetries as large as $30\%$. Our findings show that the neutrino gas asymptotically evolves toward a generic state of coarse-grained flavor equilibration which is constrained by approximate lepton number conservation. The equilibration occurs within a few factors of the inverse vacuum oscillation frequency, $\omega^{-1}$, which corresponds to (anti)neutrinos reaching near flavor equipartition after a few kilometers for typical supernova neutrino energies. Notably, the quasi-steady state of the neutrino number densities can be quantitatively described by the neutrino-antineutrino number density ratio $n_{\bar{\nu}_e}/n_{\nu_e}$ alone. Such a simple estimation opens new opportunities for incorporating SFC into CCSN simulations, particularly in regions where SFC develops on scales much shorter than those of collisions.

 - **Abstract**
 We are searching for hot, constant-color, offset optical flares in the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) data stream that are ${>}10''$ from any galaxy in public imaging data from the PanSTARRS survey. Here, we present the first discovery from this search: AT 2024puz, a luminous multiwavelength transient offset by $5\,$kpc from a ${\sim}10^8\,M_\odot$ galaxy at $z=0.356$ with a low-moderate star formation rate. It produced luminous $10^{44.79 \pm 0.04}\,{\rm erg\,s}^{-1}$ optical/UV emission that evolved on a ${\sim}20\,$day timescale, as well as $10^{44.12\pm0.03}\,{\rm erg\,s}^{-1}$ X-ray emission with a photon-index $\Gamma=1.7$. No associated radio or millimeter emission was detected. We show that the early-time optical emission is likely powered by reprocessing of high-energy, accretion-powered radiation, with a possible contribution from a shock in a dense circum-transient medium. If the shock is dominant at early-times, the circum-transient medium has a mass ${\sim}0.1-1\,M_\odot$, radius $10^{15}\,$cm, and a density profile shallower than ${\sim}r^{-1}$. A near-infrared excess appears at late-times and is suggestive of reprocessing within a wind or other circum-transient medium. The X-rays are most consistent with a central engine. We suggest that AT 2024puz may be associated with an accretion event onto a $50-10^5\,M_\odot$ BH, where the lower masses are preferred based on the large projected offset from the host galaxy. AT2024puz exhibits properties similar to both luminous fast blue optical transients (LFBOTs) and tidal disruption events (TDEs), but is intermediate between them in its energetics and evolution timescale. This highlights the need for broader exploration of the landscape of hot optical transients to trace their origins.

 - **Abstract**
 Some carbon-rich Wolf-Rayet stars (WC stars) show an infrared excess from dust emission. Dust forms in the collision of the WC wind with a companion star's wind. As this dust is carried towards the ISM at close to the WCd wind speed and the binary continues through its orbit, a spiral structure forms around the system. The shape depends on the orbital eccentricity and period, as well as stellar parameters like mass-loss rates and terminal wind speeds. Imaging of the WCd binary WR 140 with JWST/MIRI revealed at least 17 concentric dust shells surrounding the binary. We present new JWST imaging of four additional WCd systems (WR 48a, WR 112, WR 125, and WR 137) that were imaged in 2024. In this analysis, we show that the dust is long-lived, surviving for at least 130 years, but more than 300 years in some systems. Longer duration measurements are limited by sensitivity. Regular spacing of dust features confirms the periodic nature of dust formation, consistent with a connection to binary motion. We use these images to estimate the proper motion of the dust, finding the dust to propagate out to the interstellar medium with motion comparable to the wind speed of the WC stars. In addition to these results, we observe unusual structures around WR 48a, which could represent dusty clumps shaped by photoevaporation and wind ablation like young proplyd objects. These results demonstrate that WC dust is indeed long-lived and should be accounted for in galactic dust budgets.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a comprehensive analysis of the digest2 parameters for candidates of the Near-Earth Object Confirmation Page (NEOCP) that were reported between 2019 and 2024. Our study proposes methods for significantly reducing the inclusion of non-NEO objects on the NEOCP. Despite the substantial increase in near-Earth object (NEO) discoveries in recent years, only about half of the NEOCP candidates are ultimately confirmed as NEOs. Therefore, much observing time is spent following up on non-NEOs. Furthermore, approximately 11% of the candidates remain unconfirmed because the follow-up observations are insufficient. These are nearly 600 cases per year. To reduce false positives and minimize wasted resources on non-NEOs, we refine the posting criteria for NEOCP based on a detailed analysis of all digest2 scores. We investigated 30 distinct digest2 parameter categories for candidates that were confirmed as NEOs and non-NEOs. From this analysis, we derived a filtering mechanism based on selected digest2 parameters that were able to exclude 20% of the non-NEOs from the NEOCP while maintaining a minimal loss of true NEOs. We also investigated the application of four machine-learning (ML) techniques, that is, the gradient-boosting machine (GBM), the random forest (RF) classifier, the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) classifier, and neural networks (NN) to classify NEOCP candidates as NEOs or non-NEOs. Based on digest2 parameters as input, our ML models achieved a precision of approximately 95% in distinguishing between NEOs and non-NEOs. Results. Combining the digest2 parameter filter with an ML-based classification model, we demonstrate a significant reduction in non-NEOs on the NEOCP that exceeds 80%, while limiting the loss of NEO discovery tracklets to 5.5%. Importantly, we show that most follow-up tracklets of initially misclassified NEOs are later correctly identified as NEOs.
#### HST/WFC3 Constraints on the Abundances of OH and FeH in the Atmosphere of the Ultra-Hot Neptune LTT-9779 b

 - **Abstract**
 Planets residing within the hot-Neptune Desert are rare, and studying their atmospheres can provide valuable insights into their formation and evolutionary processes. We present the atmospheric characterization of the first known ultra-hot Neptune, LTT-9779 b, using transmission spectroscopic observations obtained with the HST/WFC3 G141 and G102 grisms. Using the Iraclis pipeline and TauREx3 retrieval code, we find that LTT-9779 b likely possesses a H/He-dominated primary atmosphere with an opaque aerosol layer and the pure cloudy, flat-line model is rejected with approximately 2.7-$\sigma$ confidence. Although we do not find conclusive evidence supporting the presence of any molecular species, we place 95% confidence level upper limits on the volume mixing ratios (VMRs) of hydroxyl radical (OH) and iron hydride (FeH) at $7.18\times10^{-2}$ and $1.52\times10^{-8}$, respectively. Notably, the retrieval results are inconsistent with predictions from equilibrium chemistry models, which favor higher $\rm H_2O$ abundances over OH. This discrepancy suggests that disequilibrium processes, such as photochemistry or vertical mixing, may have altered the atmospheric composition. Comparisons between HST, Spitzer and JWST data reveal no evidence of temporal variations in the atmospheric composition of the terminator region. Our results highlight the need for higher-resolution spectroscopy and secondary eclipse observations to resolve LTT-9779 b's temperature-pressure (T-P) profile and chemical inventory definitively.

 - **Abstract**
 The formation and early evolution of Jupiter played a pivotal role in sculpting the large-scale architecture of the solar system, intertwining the narrative of Jovian early years with the broader story of the solar system's origins. The details and chronology of Jupiter's formation, however, remain elusive, primarily due to the inherent uncertainties of accretionary models, highlighting the need for independent constraints. Here we show that by analyzing the dynamics of Jupiter's satellites concurrently with its angular momentum budget, we can infer Jupiter's radius and interior state at the time of proto-solar nebula's dissipation. In particular, our calculations reveal that Jupiter was $2$ to $2.5$ times as large as it is today, 3.8 million years after the formation of the first solids in the solar system. Our model further indicates that young Jupiter possessed a magnetic field of approximately $B_{\rm{J}}^{\dagger} \approx 21$ mT (a factor of $\sim50$ higher than its present-day value) and was accreting material through a circum-Jovian disk at a rate of $\dot{M} = 1.2-2.4$ Jupiter masses per million years. Our findings are fully consistent with the core-accretion theory of giant planet formation and provide an evolutionary snapshot that pins down properties of the Jovian system at the end of the protosolar nebula's lifetime.

 - **Abstract**
 We present global magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of accretion disks with a strong toroidal magnetic field using an equation of state that fixes the gas thermal scale height. The disk forms from the inflow of a rotating magnetized gas cloud with a toroidal magnetic field. We find that the system maintains a moderately strong mean azimuthal field in the midplane, with plasma-$\beta\sim1$, trans-Alfvénic fluctuations, and large accretion stresses $\alpha\sim0.1$. The azimuthal field in the disk is continuously escaping along the vertical direction but is also replenished via a local dynamo. The inflowing gas initially forms a strongly magnetized Keplerian disk with $\beta\ll1$ and $\alpha \gg 1$. The disk gradually collapses from the inside out over $\sim 50-80$ orbits to form a moderately magnetized disk with $\beta\sim1$ and $\alpha\sim0.1$. Radial advection of azimuthal magnetic field can maintain $\beta\lesssim1$ exterior to the circularization radius but not inside of it. Inclusion of a net initial vertical magnetic field can lead to an even more strongly magnetized disk midplane, consistent with previous work. When the gas thermal scale is not resolved ($\lesssim 4$ cells per thermal scale height), however, the disk remains highly magnetized with $\beta \ll 1 $. We discuss our results in the context of related shearing box simulations and other global disk simulations. The level of angular momentum transport found here is consistent with that inferred observationally in dwarf novae and X-ray transient outbursts, unlike simulations of weakly magnetized accretion disks.

 - **Abstract**
 High-velocity clouds (HVCs), which are gas clouds moving at high velocity relative to the galactic disk, may play a critical role in galaxy evolution, potentially supplying gas to the disk and triggering star formation. In this study, we focus on the nearby face-on barred spiral galaxy M83, where high spatial resolution, high-sensitivity CO (1-0) data are available. We identified molecular clouds and searched for clouds with velocities deviating by more than 50km/s from the disk velocity field as HVCs. A total of 10 HVCs were detected -nine redshifted and one blueshifted -- clearly highlighting an asymmetry in their velocity distribution. These HVCs have radii of 30-80 pc, masses on the order of $10^5 M_\odot$, and velocity dispersions of 3-20 km/s, displaying a tendency toward higher velocity dispersion compared to disk molecular clouds in M83. Most of the HVCs do not overlap with the candidates of supernova remnants, and the energy needed to drive HVCs at such high velocities exceeds single supernova energy. Together with the asymmetry in their velocity distribution, we thus conclude that most of the HVCs found in this study are inflow from outside the M83's disk.
#### Evidence that Mass Loss on the Red Giant Branch Decreases with Metallicity

 - **Abstract**
 Mass loss on the red giant branch (RGB) influences stellar evolution, properties of stellar populations, and Galactic chemical enrichment, yet remains poorly constrained observationally. Current models provide limited insight into how stellar properties, particularly how metallicity and mass, affects RGB mass loss. Here, I introduce a new observational approach that uses the age-velocity-dispersion relation and the lower-mass boundary of red giants as precise evolutionary markers. These markers, informed by Galactic evolution, allow us to construct observational isochrones for field stars. By comparing masses of RGB stars and red clump (RC) stars at the same age in the Kepler sample, I derive empirical measurements of integrated RGB mass loss at several points in age and metallicity. Combining these new observational measurements with open-cluster studies, I showed that the integrated mass loss on the RGB decreases with metallicity, and may also decrease with stellar mass. The average mass loss rate, which accounts for RGB lifetimes and the initial mass differences between RGB and RC stars at the same age, also show a similar trend. These findings challenge current mass-loss prescriptions widely adopted in stellar evolutionary models, since none of them is able to produce the observed mass-loss trend without widely adjusting free parameters. This highlights an urgent need to revise mechanisms that govern RGB mass loss.

 - **Abstract**
 To fully understand the star formation process, we are compelled to study it in a variety of environments. Of particular interest are how star formation and the resulting initial mass function (IMF) vary as a function of metallicity. We have observed an embedded young cluster in Sh2-284 (hereafter S284), the HII region associated with the open cluster Dolidze 25 using JWST/NIRCam with the aim to study star formation in a metal-poor, i.e., about 1/3 of solar, environment. In particular, we aim to measure the peak of the IMF. Using JWST NIRCam photometry, we identified the embedded cluster S284-EC1 and resolved its low-mass content. By comparison with pre-main sequence evolutionary tracks we determine the mass and extinction for the individual cluster members. Extinction limited samples are created based on the distribution of extinction and the completeness of the data. For the region with a completeness of 50% or higher, we have fitted a log-normal distribution to the IMF. Adopting a fiducial age of 1 Myr of the members, the peak of the IMF is found to be at mc = 0.16+-0.02Msun, which is significantly smaller than the peak mass measured in local young clusters, such as mc = 0.26+0.11-0.07 Msun in the Orion Nebula Cluster (Gennaro & Robberto 2020), or the local Galactic disk value of mc = 0.25 Msun (Chabrier 2005). We have found evidence for IMF variation as a function of metallicity, i.e., the peak of the IMF shifts to lower masses as one goes from solar to 1/3 solar metallicity. However, we caution that the result is sensitive to the assumed age of the stellar population, i.e., with peak mass rising if an age older than 1 Myr is adopted. This study further motivates the need for expanded samples of low-metallicity regions and their content to enable more comprehensive measures of the IMF in such environments.

 - **Abstract**
 Directly imaged exoplanets in wide orbits challenge current gas giant formation theories. They need to form quickly and acquire enough material before the disk dissipates, which cannot be accommodated by in-situ formation by core accretion. We search for wide separation ($>$ 100 au) planetary-mass companions with the Young Suns Exoplanet Survey (YSES). Here, we present a planetary-mass candidate companion discovered in the survey. We conducted follow-up observations of the candidate system after the first epoch observations and obtained six epochs of observations for this system between 2018 and 2024, and integral field spectroscopy of the stellar component. We report the detection of a candidate companion with H=22.04 $\pm$ 0.13 mag at a projected separation of 730 $\pm$ 10 au away from the primary star. High angular resolution imaging observations of the central star show it is a visual binary. Acceleration data, orbital fitting, spectral energy distribution fitting and radial velocity differences all suggest that there is at least one more unresolved low-mass stellar companion in this system. The planetary-mass candidate shows a significant proper motion comparable to that of the primary star. We estimate an age of 19-28 Myr for the primary star. We cannot confirm the companionship of the candidate due to the unknown barycentre of the stars. Long-term imaging and radial velocity monitoring of the central stars, along with spectroscopy of the candidate companion, are key to resolving the nature of this system. If confirmed, the candidate companion would have a mass of 3-5 Mj estimated with the ATMO evolutionary model. It would be another cold low-mass planet imaged similar to 51 Eri b and AF Lep b. Its extremely wide separation from the host star would challenge the formation theory of gas giant exoplanets.
#### Gamma Analytical Modeling Evolution (GAME) I: The physical implications of deriving the stellar mass functions from z=0 to z=8

 - **Abstract**
 The $\Gamma$ growth model is an effective parameterization employed across various scientific disciplines and scales to depict growth. It has been demonstrated that the cosmic star formation rate density (CSFRD) can also be described broadly by this pattern, i.e. $\frac{dM(T)}{dT} = M_{z,0}\, \times \frac{\beta^{\alpha}}{\Gamma(\alpha)} \, T^{\alpha-1} e^{-\beta \, T }$ M$_{\odot}$ Gyr$^{-1}$, where $M_{z,0}$ is the stellar mass at $z$ = 0, $\alpha = 3.0$, $\beta = 0.5 $ Gyr$^{-1}$ and $T$ describes time. We use the identical $\Gamma$ growth pattern given by the CSFRD to extend the present day (z = 0) stellar mass bins $M_{\ast}(T)$ of the Galaxy Stellar Mass Function (GSMF) and investigate if we are able to reproduce observations for the high redshift GSMFs. Surprisingly, our scheme describes successfully the evolution of the GSMF over 13.5 Gyrs, especially for objects with intermediate and low masses. We observe some deviations that manifest {\it solely} at very high redshifts ($z > 1.5$, i.e. more than 9.5 Gyr ago) and {\it specifically} for very small and exceedingly massive objects. We discuss the possible solutions (e.g. impacts of mergers) for these offsets. Our formalism suggests that the evolution of the GSMF is set by simple (few parameters) and physically motivated arguments. The parameters $\beta$ and $\alpha$ are theoretically consistent within a multi-scale context and are determined from the dynamical time scale ($\beta$) and the radial distribution of the accreting matter ($\alpha$). We demonstrate that both our formalism and state-of-the-art simulations are consistent with recent GSMFs derived from JWST data at high redshifts.

 - **Abstract**
 During the early stages of star formation, accretion processes such as infall from the envelope and molecular streamers, and ejection of matter through winds and jets take place simultaneously. The Class 0/I binary [BHB2007] 11 shows evidence for accretion and ejection at the scales of the circumbinary disk and the inner close binary. Recent H$_2$CO observations showed two elongated structures with hints of outflowing motion almost perpendicular to the main CO outflow, which is launched from the circumbinary disk. With the aim of verifying the nature of these elongated structures, we analyze the line emission of H$^{13}$CO$^+$, CCH, c-C$_3$H$_2$ and SiO observed with ALMA within the Large Program FAUST. These molecules trace material moving at velocities close to the ambient cloud velocity. The images of H$^{13}$CO$^+$, CCH, c-C$_3$H$_2$ show the elongated structures, whose gas kinematics are consistent with outflowing motions and with rotation in the opposite sense to the main CO outflow. The derived mass loss rate from these large-scale structures is $(1.8\pm0.5)\times10^{-6}M_{\odot}\textrm{ yr}^{-1}$, in agreement with those measured in outflows driven by Class 0/I protostars. The SiO image reveals compact emission close to the binary system, with a slight elongation aligned with the larger-scale structures. This suggests that SiO is released from the sputtering of dust grains in the shocked material at the base of the potential new outflow, with a relative abundance of $\geq(0.11-2.0)\times10^{-9}$. However, higher angular and spectral resolution observations are needed to accurately estimate the outflow launching radius and its powering source. Given the location and the abundance of the SiO emission, we propose that the second outflow may be launched from inside the circumbinary disk, likely by the less massive companion, which is actively accreting material from its surroundings.

#### An emulator for the ionizing photon mean free path in ultra-high resolution simulations: the implications of mean free path measurements for the reionization history

 - **Abstract**
 Measurements of the mean free path of ionizing photons from high-redshift quasar spectra at $z \sim 5$-$6$ constrain the reionization history, but interpreting them requires modeling the kiloparsec-scale clumping that large-volume reionization simulations cannot resolve. We present a deep learning emulator for the mean free path (MFP) trained on high-resolution cosmological radiative transfer simulations of ionization fronts sweeping through small 2 comoving~Mpc/h volumes. Using a residual multi-layer perceptron neural network, we predict the MFP at a given redshift as a function of the reionization redshift, photoionization rate, wavelength, and box-scale density, achieving a median relative error of 1.6\% across nearly four orders of magnitude in MFP. Integrating its predictions over box-scale overdensity and an extended reionization history allows the emulator to predict the global MFP. We apply the emulator to extended reionization histories constrained by observed photoionization rates, finding that models prefer late reionization with substantial neutral fractions persisting at $z \lesssim 6$. Fitting a parametric ionization history yields a midpoint of reionization of $z_{\rm re} = 6.8\pm 1.2$ for reionization durations consistent with Planck and kinetic Sunyaev-Zeldovich constraints, and the universe being $10\%$ neutral still at $z_{\rm re} < 5.8 ~(6.3)$ at 1~(2)$\sigma$. Global ionizing emissivity inferences using measurements of the photoionization rate and MFP plus our emulator, which avoids common power-law assumptions, suggest a factor of $2-3$ decline between $z = 6$ and $4.8$, in agreement with previous studies. Our method provides an efficient (and more converged) alternative to large-volume radiative-hydrodynamic simulations of reionization for interpreting MFP measurements, and can also serve as a subgrid prescription for the ionizing opacity within such simulations.

 - **Abstract**
 In the solar neighborhood, the Initial Mass Function (IMF) follows is canonically described by the Salpeter power-law slope for the high-mass range. The stellar IMF may directly result from a Core Mass Function (CMF) through accretion, gravitational collapse, and fragmentation. This inheritance implies that the mass of the gaseous fragments may be connected to the properties of clustered and multiple stellar systems. We aim to (i) quantify the influence of hierarchical fragmentation of cores on the resulting IMF, and (ii) determine the consequences of this fragmentation on the multiplicity of the stellar systems. We employed a scale-free, hierarchical fragmentation model to investigate the fragmentation of top-heavy CMF. Hierarchical fragmentation of gas clumps shifts the CMF towards lower mass range and can modify its shape. Starting from the top-heavy power-law CMF observed in W43-MM2&MM3 star forming region, we show that at least four levels of hierarchical fragmentation are required to generate the turn-over peak of the cIMF. Within a radius of 0.2-2.5 kAU, massive stars (M > 10 Msun) have on average 0.9 companions, five times fewer than low-mass stars (M < 0.1 Msun); the latter are less dynamically stable and should disperse. We show that a universal IMF can emerge from mass-dependent fragmentation processes provided that more massive cores produce less fragments compared to lower mass cores and transfer their mass less efficiently to their fragments. Hierarchical fragmentation alone cannot reconcile a universal IMF with observed stellar multiplicity. We propose that fragmentation is not scale-free but operates in two distinct regimes: a mass-dependent phase establishing the Salpeter slope and a mass-independent phase setting the turn-over. Our framework provides a way to compare core subfragmentation in various star-forming regions and numerical simulations.

 - **Abstract**
 Alcohols and aldehydes represent two key classes of interstellar complex organic molecules (COMs). This work seeks to better understand their possible chemical connections, with a focus on such molecules in the sources of the star-forming region Sgr B2 (N). The gas-phase reaction between ethanol (CH3CH2OH) and the halogens fluorine and chlorine was investigated via DFT calculations, with the goal of determining whether astrochemically viable chemical pathways leading to acetaldehyde (CH3CHO) exist. The studied reactions were then included in an astrochemical model of Sgr B2 (N) to determine their significance under real interstellar conditions. Our DFT calculations revealed that both chlorine and fluorine can react barrierlessly with ethanol to abstract a hydrogen atom. We further found that, following this initial step, the resulting ethanol radicals can undergo further reactions with atomic hydrogen, with some routes leading to acetaldehyde. Incorporation of these novel reactions in astrochemical models of hot cores suggest that they are indeed efficient under those conditions, and can lead to modest increases in the abundance of CH3CHO during model times where gas-phase ethanol is abundant. Of the ethanol radicals included in our chemical network, we found CH3CHOH to have the highest abundances in our simulations comparable to that of ethanol at some model times. Overall, this work reveals a novel gas-phase ``top-down'' link from alcohols to aldehydes that compliments the better studied ``bottom-up'' routes involving grain-surface H-addition reactions yielding alcohols from aldehydes. Moreover, results from our astrochemical models suggest that the ethanol radical CH3CHOH may be detectable in the interstellar medium.

 - **Abstract**
 Bulk meteorites and their inclusions exhibit, for many chemical elements, isotopic variability produced by nucleosynthetic events in stars and supernovae before the formation of the Sun. While the exact astrophysical origins of these variations are still a matter of debate, their identification provides insights on the environment of the Sun's birth and the formation of the Solar System. Here we present a new Python tool called SIMPLE (Stellar Interpretation of Meteoritic Data and Plotting for Everyone) designed to compare the isotopic composition of the ejecta from core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) with meteoritic data. In the present version, the SIMPLE toolkit includes a dataset of 18 CCSN models, from 6 different published sets, with initial masses of 15, 20, and 25 M$_{\odot}$ and solar metallicity. SIMPLE is designed to easily extract the isotopic abundances predicted by each CCSN model for any elements and post-process them into the format needed to compare to the meteoritic data, therefore, facilitating their interpretation. As an example of how to use SIMPLE, we analyze the composition of the Ni isotopes in the 18 models and confirm that bulk meteorite Ni anomalies are compatible with material from the innermost Si-rich region of CCSN ejecta. Designed as a collaborative platform, SIMPLE is open-source and welcomes community contributions to enhance its development and dissemination for stellar nucleosynthesis and meteoritic studies. Future enhancements include addition of more model predictions and inclusion of mixing between different layers of supernova ejecta.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the formation of the recently detected HNSO molecule using quantum chemical calculations on ices and astrochemical models in tandem. Our results indicate that HNSO is efficiently produced on grain surfaces through reactions involving atomic oxygen and nitrogen atoms with the radicals NS and SO, forming NSO as a key intermediate. Subsequent hydrogenation of NSO leads to HNSO, with a clear preference for the lowest energy cis conformer, while the trans form is metastable and may be short-lived under typical interstellar conditions. The models predict that solid HNSO can reach abundances comparable to icy OCS, placing it among the major sulfur-bearing species in interstellar ices. Gas-phase abundances, in contrast, remain lower than those of OCS. The implementation of a multibinding scheme in our models clarifies the role of diffusive chemistry in the production of HNSO at early times, improving agreement with observations. These findings suggest that reactions involving diffusing O and N atoms on icy grains contribute significantly to sulfur chemistry and beyond in dense clouds and motivate further searches for molecules containing simultaneously H, N, O and S in other astronomical environments.
#### Emergence of cyclic flux eruptions in kinetic simulations of magnetized spherical accretion onto a Schwarzschild black hole

 - **Abstract**
 The dynamics of black hole magnetospheres critically depend on the black hole spin and on the structure of the accretion flow. In the limit of a Schwarzschild black hole immersed in a zero-net angular momentum flow, accretion is spherical. However, in the presence of a large-scale vertical magnetic field, the classical Bondi accretion model is significantly altered. The frozen-in field is stretched radially as the plasma is pulled inward by gravity. This continues until the restoring force from the magnetic tension suddenly expels the material and resets the field, allowing a new cycle to begin. Although this scenario has been well depicted in previous studies, it remains incomplete as the issues of dissipation and particle acceleration are not yet fully resolved. In this work, we aim to revisit these issues with a first-principles kinetic plasma model. We perform two-dimensional global general relativistic particle-in-cell simulations of magnetized spherical accretion onto a Schwarzschild black hole, for both pair and electron-ion plasmas. The simulations are evolved over long timescales to capture multiple flux eruption events and establish a quasi-steady state. For each accretion cycle, we find that the system goes through three main stages: (i) an ideal advection phase where magnetic flux through the horizon increases quasi-linearly with time; (ii) a reconnection-regulated phase where the net increase of the flux is slowed down by intermittent reconnection events near the horizon; and (iii) a flaring phase when a major, large-scale reconnection event expels the flux, leading to efficient particle acceleration. The emergence of large-amplitude quasi-periodic flux eruptions and concomitant particle acceleration is reminiscent of Sgr A* flaring activity. This phenomenon could also be applicable to quiescent black holes, especially isolated black holes accreting the interstellar medium.

 - **Abstract**
 Polarized dust emission is a major astrophysical foreground contaminant of the cosmic microwave background polarization (CMB), which must be accurately measured to look for the faint primordial polarization B-modes of inflationary origin. The available maps to date, obtained from Planck space mission data, are noise-dominated in the high Galactic latitude regions that are most relevant for CMB observations. The goal of this work is to obtain better dust polarization maps from Planck observations, by exploiting both the dependence between polarization and total intensity, as well as the non-Gaussian filamentary structure of the dust emission. To this end, we use scattering transforms, which provide a stable and interpretable representation of complex non-Gaussian textures, allowing for a data-driven analysis approach requiring no explicit priors on dust. The analysis is performed locally on Cartesian patches of sky, where Stokes linear polarization parameters, redefined in a local reference frame, are modeled as the sum of a signal of interest and a nuisance term. Using multiple realizations of the random nuisance term, we recover the polarized dust maps by minimizing a composite objective function that enforces multiple statistical constraints in scattering space. The proposed algorithm reconstructs maps of polarized dust emission whose statistics are consistent with those expected from the Planck data once random nuisance realizations are added. This is confirmed in a validation test using a high signal-to-noise sky region as a test case. Comparisons with existing dust polarization maps and models show that our approach better recovers small-scale polarized dust emission, and that our reconstructed power and cross-spectra closely match those of the dust polarization maps. A second set of maps that deterministically reproduce the features of the dust polarized emission is also produced.
#### The incidence of LBV variability in the LMC

 - **Abstract**
 Luminous blue variables (LBVs) exhibit unique variability features, characterized by episodic outbursts ($>$1 mag) accompanied by spectroscopic changes (S Dor variables). It is debated if all massive stars undergo an LBV-like phase during their evolution, or instead LBVs are exotic phenomena. We aim to quantify the incidence of LBV-like variability in the blue supergiant (BSgs) population of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) using the OGLE survey. Here, we extend previous work in the Small Magellanic Cloud to the LMC, where we examine the light curves of 87 B Supergiants (BSgs) (out of 254 known BSgs) spanning timescales of twenty years, and 37 objects across a three year timescale for aperiodic variations resembling known S Dor variables. One blue supergiant, [ST92] 4-13 shows S Dor type photometric variations. New spectra of this object reveals a potential change in spectral type compared to the literature classification. However, based on its spectral characteristics and low luminosity and mass, we do not currently classify it as an LBV. Our study highlights the need to classify bona fide LBVs as stars undergoing both photometric and spectroscopic variations. Based on currently known stellar population of S Dor variables in the LMC, the lifetime of the S Dor phase is at most $\sim$10$^3$ yrs, in agreement with our duty cycle study based on OGLE data in the SMC. This is orders of magnitude shorter than assumed in literature. Our discovery of LBV-like variability at low luminosities may suggest that S Dor variations could arise from Eddington limit related physics over a wide range of stellar masses, rather than being linked to a unique evolutionary stage.
#### Early Stages of Protostellar Disk Evolution: A Link to the Initial Cloud Core

 - **Abstract**
 We study the structure and evolution of the very early protostellar disk (``protodisk'') just after protostar formation, where disk self-gravity dominates and the stellar contribution is dynamically minor. The disk redistributes angular momentum outward through outflows and gravitational torques, thereby helping to resolve the angular momentum problem of star formation. We develop a self-similar model and carry out a parameter study that examines disk stability as a function of the key drivers of early evolution, notably the infall rate from the envelope and the strength of the gravitational torques. The mass infall rate onto the disk is estimated to be that from the collapse of a Bonnor-Ebert sphere. Our results indicate that protostellar disks that form from more unstable initial cores are more likely to be Toomre-unstable. We also find that the specific angular momentum of young protostellar disks lie in the range $10^{19}\text{--}10^{20}\,{\rm cm^2\,s^{-1}}$. We find distinct power-law profiles of physical quantities in the protodisk stage, including a rotation velocity profile that is shallower than the Keplerian profile that would be established at a later stage. As a rough validity window, our assumptions are most secure during the first $\lesssim 2\times 10^{3}$\,yr after protostar formation and may plausibly extend to $\sim(0.5\text{--}1)\times 10^{4}$\,yr under weak magnetic braking and strong infall.

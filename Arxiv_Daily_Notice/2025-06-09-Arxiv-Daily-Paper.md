#### Multi-cloud crushing -- the collective survival of cold clouds in galactic outflows

 - **Abstract**
 The ram-pressure acceleration of cold gas by hot outflows plays a crucial role in the dynamics of multiphase galactic winds. Recent numerical studies incorporating radiative cooling have identified a size threshold for idealized cold clouds to survive within high-velocity outflows. This study extends the investigation to a more complex morphology of cold gas as observed in the interstellar medium. We conduct three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of ensembles of individual spherical clouds to systematically explore under which conditions the cold clouds can survive. We find that cloud ensembles can survive collectively -- even when individual clouds, if isolated, would be rapidly destroyed. Our results indicate that, besides the morphology, factors such as tight packing, small inter-cloud distance and higher fragmentation facilitate survival. We propose a novel multi-cloud survival criterion that accounts for collective properties of the cloud system, including total gas mass and the geometric configuration based on an effective volume filling fraction of the cold gas $F_V$. This fraction is computed by constructing a composite volume from individual enclosing conical boxes aligned with the wind, incorporating spatial overlap and cloud-tail spreading. The box dimensions scale with the critical survival radius $r_{\rm crit}$ from the single-cloud criterion. We find a universal threshold $F_{V,{\rm crit}}\approx 0.24$ that robustly separates surviving from destroyed systems across diverse geometric configurations. Our findings emphasize the critical importance of initial cloud distribution and fragmentation in governing the long-term evolution and survival of cold gas structures, providing insight into observed multiphase outflows and CGM dynamics.
#### Kinematic Evidence for Bipolar Ejecta Flows in the Galactic SNR W49B

 - **Abstract**
 W49B is a unique Galactic supernova remnant with centrally peaked, "bar"-like ejecta distribution, which was once considered evidence for a hypernova origin that resulted in a bipolar ejection of the stellar core. However, chemical abundance measurements contradict this interpretation. Closely connected to the morphology of the ejecta is its velocity distribution, which provides critical details for understanding the explosion mechanism. We report the first-ever observational constraint on the kinematics of the ejecta in W49B using the Resolve microcalorimeter spectrometer on the X-ray Imaging and Spectroscopy Mission (XRISM). Using XRISM/Resolve, we measured the line-of-sight velocity traced by the Fe He$\alpha$ emission, which is the brightest feature in the Resolve spectrum, to vary by $\pm$300 km s$^{-1}$ with a smooth east-to-west gradient of a few tens of km s$^{-1}$ pc$^{-1}$ along the major axis. Similar trends in the line-of-sight velocity structure were found for other Fe-group elements Cr and Mn, traced by the He$\alpha$ emission, and also for intermediate-mass elements Si, S, Ar, and Ca, traced by the Ly$\alpha$ emission. The discovery of the east-west gradient in the line-of-sight velocity, together with the absence of a twin-peaked line profile or enhanced broadening in the central region, clearly rejects the equatorially expanding disk model. In contrast, the observed velocity structure suggests bipolar flows reminiscent of a bipolar explosion scenario. An alternative scenario would be a collimation of the ejecta by an elongated cavity sculpted by bipolar stellar winds.
#### The TOI-1117 Multi-planetary System: 3 sub-Neptunes, 1 in both the Neptunian Desert and Radius Valley

 - **Abstract**
 We present the discovery of three sub-Neptune planets around TOI-1117, a Sun-like star with mass $0.97\pm0.02M_{\odot}$, radius $1.05\pm0.03R_{\odot}$, age $4.42\pm1.50$ Gyr and effective temperature $5635\pm62$ K. Light curves from TESS and LCOGT show a transiting sub-Neptune with a $2.23$ day period, mass $M_b=8.90_{-0.96}^{+0.95}M_{\oplus}$ and radius $R_b=2.46_{-0.12}^{+0.13}R_{\oplus}$. This is a rare 'hot Neptune' that falls within the parameter spaces known as the 'Neptunian Desert' and the 'Radius Valley'. Two more planetary signals are detected in HARPS radial velocities, revealing two non-transiting planets with minimum masses $M_c=7.46_{-1.62}^{+1.43}M_{\oplus}$ and $M_d=9.06_{-1.78}^{+2.07}M_{\oplus}$, and periods of $4.579\pm0.004$ and $8.67\pm0.01$ days. The eccentricities were poorly constrained by the HARPS data, with upper limits $e_b=0.11$, $e_c=0.29$, and $e_d=0.24$. However, dynamical simulations of the TOI-1117 system, suggest that the orbits must be nearly circular to be stable. The simulations also show that TOI-1117b and c are likely to be in a near 2:1 resonance. The multi-planet nature of TOI-1117 makes it a more complex case for formation theories of the Neptunian Desert and Radius Valley, as current theories such as high-eccentricity migration are too turbulent to produce a stable, non-eccentric, multi-planet system. Moreover, analysis of TOI-1117b's photoevaporation history found rocky core and H/He atmosphere models to be inconsistent with observations, whilst water-rich scenarios were favoured.

 - **Abstract**
 Helium-core white dwarfs (He WDs) formed through common envelope (CE) evolution offer valuable insight into binary interaction channels and compact remnant formation. Their cooling rates critically impact both detectability and age estimates in close binaries. Compared to He WDs formed via stable Roche-lobe overflow (SRLOF), those from the CE channel undergo markedly different mass-loss histories, resulting in distinct post-CE evolutionary behavior. We explore how the mass of the residual hydrogen envelope (Mh) shapes the cooling evolution of CE He WDs, focusing on the role of the bifurcation point in setting Mh and enabling residual hydrogen burning. Using the LPCODE stellar evolution code, we computed models of He WDs with masses from 0.20 to 0.42 solar masses, evolving from post-CE conditions to the white dwarf cooling track. Two evolutionary branches emerge: (i) non-flashing sequences, which cool rapidly with negligible hydrogen burning, and (ii) flashing sequences, where hydrogen shell flashes alter the envelope structure prior to cooling. Minimal-envelope models cool within 5-130 million years for effective temperatures between 12,000 and 27,000 K, and reach in approx. 300 million years at lower temperatures, remaining much younger than SRLOF counterparts. In contrast, models with more hydrogen retain active nuclear burning, delaying cooling and yielding ages of several billion years. Flashing sequences prolong the pre-white dwarf phase, though still shorter than in SRLOF evolution. The value of Mh also affects WD mass and surface gravity estimates, introducing systematic shifts with respect to SRLOF WDs. Our results show that CE He WDs follow distinct evolutionary paths, with important implications for interpreting the nature and fate of compact binaries hosting He WDs.

 - **Abstract**
 The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) has surveyed nearly the entire sky in Full-Frame Image mode with a time resolution of 200 seconds to 30 minutes and a temporal baseline of at least 27 days. In addition to the primary goal of discovering new exoplanets, TESS is exceptionally capable at detecting variable stars, and in particular short-period eclipsing binaries which are relatively common, making up a few percent of all stars, and represent powerful astrophysical laboratories for deep investigations of stellar formation and evolution. We combed Sectors 1-82 of TESS Full-Frame Image data searching for eclipsing binary stars using a neural network that identified ~1.2 million stars with eclipse-like features. Of these, we have performed an in-depth analysis on ~60,000 targets using automated methods and manual inspection by citizen scientists. Here we present a catalog of 10001 uniformly-vetted and -validated eclipsing binary stars that passed all our ephemeris and photocenter tests, as well as complementary visual inspection. Of these, 7936 are new eclipsing binaries while the remaining 2065 are known systems for which we update the published ephemerides. We outline the detection and analysis of the targets, discuss the properties of the sample, and highlight potentially interesting systems. Finally, we also provide a list of ~900,000 unvetted and unvalidated targets for which the neural network found eclipse-like features with a score higher than 0.9, and for which there are no known eclipsing binaries within a sky-projected separation of a TESS pixel (~21 arcsec).

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the interaction between two filaments (F1 and F2) and their subsequent magnetic reconnection in active region (AR) NOAA 13296 and AR NOAA 13293 on May 9, 2023, utilizing high spatial and temporal resolution and multi-wavelength observational data from the Solar Dynamics Observatory, the New Vacuum Solar Telescope, and the Chinese H{\alpha} Solar Explorer. The movement of F1 from the southeast toward the northwest, driven by the motion of the positive magnetic polarity (P1), leads to a collision and reconnection with F2. This reconnection exchanges their footpoints, resulting in the formation of two new filaments (F3 and F4) consistent with "slingshot" type filament interaction. During the interaction, the current sheet moving due to the motion of F1 and the reconnection outflows moving along F3 and F4 were both observed. The current sheet is rarely observed in the slingshot type filament interaction, measuring approximately 2.17 Mm in length and 0.84 Mm in width. After the interaction, the F1 disappears whereas a portion of F2 remains, indicating that the interaction involves partial slingshot reconnection, due to the unequal magnetic flux between the filaments. The residual part of F2 will undergo another magnetic reconnection in the same interaction region with the magnetic loops connecting polarities N1 and P1. The material generated by the reconnection is continuously injected into F4, leading to its final morphology. The findings enhance our understanding of slingshot-type filament interactions, indicating that partial slingshot reconnections between filaments may be more common than full slingshot events.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent studies suggest that the density structure of turbulent molecular clouds in the Milky Way and the Andromeda galaxy, M31, aligns with expectations from hydrostatic equilibrium (HE) and virial equilibrium (VE). This study extends the study of the M31 clouds by matching their observed surface densities to a spatially-averaged solution of the Lane-Emden equation. The results affirm that the M31 molecular clouds exhibit density profiles expected from HE, further supporting the earlier conclusion that VE holds at all radii within the clouds. This study also discusses HE in the context of the turbulent interstellar medium, considering energy balance, cloud lifetimes, and the pressure of the interstellar medium. A comparison between the Galactic and extragalactic clouds indicates that both share similar dynamical states. These findings contribute to a broader understanding of the interplay between turbulence, gravitational stability, and cloud evolution in the molecular interstellar medium.
#### Faint absorption of the ground state hyperfine-splitting transitions of hydroxyl at 18 cm in the Galactic Disk

 - **Abstract**
 The interstellar hydride hydroxyl (OH) is a potential tracer of CO-dark molecular gas. We present new absorption line observations of OH at 18-cm wavelength towards four continuum sources. We compare these to the [CII] line at 1.9 THz obtained with SOFIA, observations of the neutral atomic hydrogen 21 cm line with the VLA, and CO lines obtained with APEX. We trace OH over a large range of molecular hydrogen column densities, and derive OH abundances with respect to molecular and total hydrogen column densities. Increased sensitivity and spectral resolution allowed us to detect weak and narrow features. We identify only one OH absorption component out of 23 without CO counterpart, yet several with intermediate molecular gas fractions. A potential association of [CII] 158 mu m emission with an OH absorption component is seen toward one sightline. Our results confirm that OH absorption traces molecular gas across diffuse and dense environments of the interstellar medium. At the sensitivity limits of the present observations our detection of only one CO-dark molecular gas feature appears in agreement with previous studies. We conclude that if OH absorption was to be used as a CO-dark molecular gas tracer, deeper observations or stronger background targets are necessary to unveil its full potential as a CO-dark molecular gas tracer, and yet it will never be an exclusive tracer of CO-dark molecular gas. For OH hyperfine-splitting transitions in the vicinity of photodissociation regions in W43-South, we detect a spectral and spatial offset between the peak of the inversion of the OH 1612 MHz line and the absorption of the OH 1720 MHz line on the one hand, and the absorption of the OH main lines on the other hand, which provides additional constraints on the interpretation of the OH 18 cm line signatures typical of HII regions.

 - **Abstract**
 Venus has regained attention on the international stage with the approval of three new missions by ESA and NASA. As the twin sister of Earth, Venus exhibits a distinct atmosphere, which casts a veil of mystery over the planetary evolution and is of great scientific significance. One of the most important components of Venus-the cloud-is believed to have significantly regulated its climate evolution and affect the environmental habitability. However, due to sparse in-situ measurements and the limitation of remote sensing, properties of these clouds remain largely unknown. Based on research conducted in past decades, this article reviews the observational structure of cloud properties, the progress of microphysical and simplified cloud model developments, and perspectives of future directions of this research field. Several possible solutions to the challenges associated with the coupling effect, ultraviolet absorption, and habitability are proposed and discussed in details, providing insights for future Venus' explorations.

 - **Abstract**
 Primordial black holes (PBHs) constitute a compelling dark matter candidate whose gravitational effects could significantly influence early cosmic structure formation. We investigate the impact of PBHs on Population III star formation through detailed $N$-body and hydrodynamic simulations, extending beyond previous semi-analytical approaches. Our results reveal a mass-dependent dichotomy in PBH effects: massive PBHs ($M_{\rm PBH} \gtrsim 10^2 M_\odot$) with sufficient abundance can accelerate structure formation and shift Pop III formation to higher redshifts, potentially conflicting with observational constraints from high-redshift galaxy surveys. Conversely, lower-mass PBHs can induce tidal disruption of gas-rich minihalos, suppressing star formation and delaying the cosmic dawn depending on their abundance. We quantify these competing effects to derive new constraints on the PBH mass function and their contribution to the total dark matter density, with implications for forthcoming observations with the James Webb Space Telescope and 21-cm cosmology experiments.
#### TOI-2407 b: a warm Neptune in the desert

 - **Abstract**
 We present the validation of TOI-2407 b, a warm Neptune-sized planet with a radius of 4.26 $\pm$ 0.26 R$_\oplus$, orbiting an early M-type star with a period of 2.7 days and an equilibrium temperature of 705 $\pm$ 12 K. The planet was identified by TESS photometry and validated in this work through multi-wavelength ground-based follow-up observations. We include an observation with the novel CMOS-based infrared instrument SPIRIT at the SPECULOOS Southern Observatory. The high-precision transit data enabled by CMOS detectors underscore their potential for improving the detection and characterisation of exoplanets orbiting M-dwarfs, particularly in the infrared, where these stars emit most of their radiation. TOI-2407 b lies within the boundaries of the period-radius Neptune desert, an apparent scarcity of Neptune-sized planets at short orbits. Further characterisation of TOI-2407 b, such as radial velocity measurements, will refine its position within planetary demographic trends. This system also provides a comparison case for the well-studied Neptune-sized planet Gliese 436 b, of similar radius, period and stellar type. Comparison studies could aid the understanding of the formation and evolution of Neptune-like planets around M-dwarfs.

 - **Abstract**
 The properties of satellite halos provide a promising probe for dark matter (DM) physics. Observations motivate current efforts to explain surprisingly compact DM halos. If DM is not collisionless but has strong self-interactions, halos can undergo gravothermal collapse, leading to higher densities in the central region of the halo. However, it is challenging to model this collapse phase from first principles. To improve on this, we seek to better understand numerical challenges and convergence properties of self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) N-body simulations in the collapse phase. Especially we aim for a better understanding of the evolution of satellite halos. To do so, we run SIDM N-body simulations of a low mass halo in isolation and within an external gravitational potential. The simulation setup is motivated by the perturber of the stellar stream GD-1. We find that the halo evolution is very sensitive to energy conservation errors, and a too large SIDM kernel size can artificially speed up the collapse. Moreover, we demonstrate that the King model can describe the density profile at small radii for the late stages that we have simulated. Furthermore, for our highest-resolved simulation (N = 5x10^7) we make the data public. It can serve as a benchmark. Overall, we find that the current numerical methods do not suffer from convergence problems in the late collapse phase and provide guidance on how to choose numerical parameters, e.g. that the energy conservation error is better kept well below 1%. This allows to run simulations of halos becoming concentrated enough to explain observations of GD-1 like stellar streams or strong gravitational lensing systems.

#### StarDICE IV: Characterizing atmosphere gray extinction with thermal infrared observations

 - **Abstract**
 The StarDICE experiment seeks to establish a metrology chain linking laboratory standards to astrophysical fluxes, targeting 1 mmag accuracy in the $\textit{griz}$ bands. Reaching this precision requires mitigating variable atmospheric effects, especially gray extinction from clouds, which remains a major challenge. To address this challenge, we present a novel method for correcting photometric data using simultaneous radiometric measurements from an infrared thermal camera. The gray extinction correction model is fitted on an image-by-image basis as a function of thermal radiance excess and difference between synthetic and instrumental fluxes of calibration stars. This approach stands out by avoiding any assumptions about spatial structure and leveraging a forward model combining in situ environmental monitoring, radiative transfer simulations and use of Gaia Data Release 3 star catalogs. We demonstrate the method using data collected from a dedicated experimental remote observation system, built to conduct repeated observations of two fields over several nights in varying atmosphere conditions. We show that applying the correction model to each source in the test sample results in a reduction of residuals between corrected and reference magnitudes. It delivers extinction correction maps for individual images with a resolution of 2 arcmin and an accuracy of $\sim$0.01 mag. This leads to a significant improvement in accuracy per image, with the mean absolute error decreasing from 0.64 to 0.11 mag for the most gray extinguished exposures. The temporal variations in extinction for non-ideal photometric sequences can be reduced to 0.025 mag per source, which is promising for its application in StarDICE.

 - **Abstract**
 At the end of their lives the most massive stars collapse into black holes (BHs). The detection of an 85 $M_{\odot}$ BH from GW 190521 appeared to challenge the upper-mass limit imposed by pair-instability (PI). Using systematic MESA calculations with new mass-loss implementations, we show that 100 $M_{\odot}$ stars at metallicities below 0.1 $Z_{\odot}$ can evolve into blue supergiant progenitors with cores small enough to avoid PI, yet with limited envelope loss, yielding remnants within the second mass gap. The key ingredients involve (i) a proper consideration of internal mixing and (ii) physically motivated stellar winds. Our modelling provides a robust pathway that roughly doubles the maximum BH mass permitted by PI theory and establish a physically-consistent framework to explore the upper BH mass limit versus metallicity. For rapid rotation ($\ge$50\% of critical), the upper BH mass comes down to $\simeq$35 $M_{\odot}$, matching the LIGO/Virgo BH mass pile-up.

 - **Abstract**
 We present results from very deep (485 ks) Chandra X-ray observations of the relaxed, cool core cluster Abell 2029 (z = 0.0767). A2029 hosts one of the longest, most continuous sloshing spirals ever observed, which we find extends nearly 600 kpc from the cluster core. In addition to providing detailed views of the sloshing spiral, imaging and spectroscopic analysis reveals ICM substructure related to the merger history including a broad ``splash'' of cooler gas and a potential merger shock. The radio lobes of the central WAT source show evidence of alignment with the sloshing motions, consistent with ICM bulk flow, rather than host-galaxy motion, being the primary driver of lobe bending. Comparison to a 1:10 mass-ratio off-axis merger simulation indicates that the observed ICM structures are relics of a second core passage of a subcluster ~4 Gyr after the start of the merger, where the ``splash'' feature is revealed to be a wake of cool gas trailing behind the subcluster. Overall, our results suggest that A2029 is still settling from past interactions -- showing that even the initially most relaxed-looking clusters can be hiding a rich history of dynamical activity.

 - **Abstract**
 The coronal blowout jet, extreme ultraviolet (EUV) wave and coronal mass ejection (CME) are common phenomena in the solar atmosphere. In this paper, we report the occurrence of an M-shaped CME event associated with a blowout jet and an EUV wave using high-resolution, multi-angle and multi-wavelength observations taken from Solar Dynamics Observatory, and Solar TErrestrial RElations Observatory. Interestingly, and for the first time, it is found that two bubble-like CMEs and a jet-like CME were simultaneously triggered by the same eruptive event. Our observational analyses and findings indicate the following: (1) the eruption of a blowout jet led to a large-scale EUV wave; (2) the eruption of the EUV wave swept a small filament (prominence) and a long filament; (3) eventually the EUV wave split-up into two parts, leading to the two bubble-like CMEs, while the blowout jet induced a jet-like CME. The combined events appear to form an M-shape like structure CME, that we sketch throughout a proposed cartoon tentatively explaining the observed complex configuration. Based on observational diagnosis, we argue that the jet, the EUV wave and the multi-CME are highly interlinked. A suggested eruption-model, from the solar atmosphere to the space, is outlined and discussed, providing a possibly new way to probe the relationship between the solar eruptions and the surrounding space. The investigation of such rare phenomenon can be a key point for better understanding of the physical associated triggering mechanisms and energy transport in the solar atmosphere, crucial for MHD simulations and modeling.

 - **Abstract**
 Planet formation may begin much earlier than previously expected, when the protoplanetary disk is still massive and gravitationally unstable. It has been proposed that solid grains can concentrate in the spiral arms of self-gravitating disks, leading to the formation of planetary embryos or cores that can greatly accelerate the process of planet formation. We perform hydrodynamic simulations of self-gravitating gas and even smaller dust grains than previously investigated in 3-dimensional shearing box simulations to explore the conditions necessary to form these planetary seeds. Focusing on small grains of dimensionless stopping time $\mathrm{St}=0.01$ and shorter, we find that disk metallicities $Z \gtrsim 0.02$ can overcome the disruptive effects of dust diffusion among these small dust grains. In the outer reaches of a gravitationally unstable disk, these models correspond to grains of approximately 1$\,mm$ and lead to planetary embryos between 0.1 and 1 Earth mass. The formation of these planetary embryos could therefore reduce the time needed for planet assembly, particularly in the outer regions of the disk where coagulation timescales are longer and solid growth is limited.

 - **Abstract**
 The circumnuclear region of the Galactic Center offers a unique laboratory to study energy balance and structure formation around Sgr A$\star$. This work investigates thermal and nonthermal processes within 7 pc distance from Sgr A$\star$. Using MeerKAT 1.3 GHz radio continuum data and ALMA H40 radio recombination line emission from the ACES survey, we separate free-free and synchrotron components at $\sim$0.2 pc resolution. With a thermal fraction of $\simeq$13%, the 1.3 GHz emission shows tight correlations with the Herschel PACS infrared data. The correlation between the equipartition magnetic field and molecular gas traced by JCMT $^{12}$CO (J=3$\rightarrow$2) observations reveals a balance between the magnetic field, cosmic rays, and molecular gas pressures south of the circumnuclear disk on $\sim$0.7 pc scales. Unlike the magnetic field and ionized gas, the molecular gas density declines in the cavity (R$\leq$2 pc) toward the center, likely due to feedback from Sgr A$\star$. We find that nonthermal pressure from turbulent gas nearly balances magnetic and cosmic ray pressures and exceeds thermal pressure by two orders of magnitude. The medium surrounding Sgr A$\star$ is filled by a low-$\beta$ (thermal-to-magnetic energy), supersonic plasma, with an Alfvén Mach number $\simeq$ 4 (assuming equipartition). Analysis of the mass-to-magnetic flux ratio suggests that the circumnuclear region is mostly subcritical and, therefore, the magnetic field can help stabilize gas clouds against gravitational collapse.
#### Observational signatures of outside-in accretion bursts in embedded protostars

 - **Abstract**
 Optical and infrared surveys have detected increasing numbers of disc accretion outbursts in young stars. Some models of these FU Ori-type events predict that the outburst should start at near- to mid-infrared wavelengths before an optical rise is detected, and this lag between infrared and optical bursts has been observed in at least two systems. Detecting and characterizing infrared precursors can constrain the outburst trigger region, and thus help identify the mechanism producing the outburst. However, because FU Ori objects are generally young and usually embedded in dusty protostellar envelopes, it is not clear whether or how well such infrared precursors can be detected in the presence of strong envelope extinction. To explore this question, we combine time-dependent outburst models of the inner disc with an outer dusty disc and protostellar envelope, and calculate the resulting spectral energy distributions (SEDs) using the radiative transfer code RADMC3D. We find that, for envelope mass infall rates about 10^{-5} Msun/yr (rc/30 au)^{-1/2}, where rc is a characteristic inner radius for the infalling envelope, the infrared precursor is only apparent in the SED when viewed along the outflow cavity. At other inclinations, the precursor is most easily distinguished at infall rates of 10^{-6} Msun/yr (rc/30 au)^{-1/2}. We also show that far-IR and submm/mm monitoring can enable the indirect detection of precursor evolution long before the optical outburst, emphasizing the potential of long-wavelength monitoring for studying the earliest stages of protostar formation.

 - **Abstract**
 Taking advantage of the near-infrared calcium triplet lines, we determine metallicities for a sample of more than 3,500 red giant stars in the field of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). We find a median metallicity of [Fe/H]=-1.05$\pm$0.01 dex with a negative metallicity gradient of -0.064$\pm$0.007 dex deg$^{-1}$ between 1.2°~to 6.0°consistent with an outside-in evolution scenario. For the first time, we detect hints of a positive metallicity gradient within 1.2°, likely reflecting radial migration or centralised chemical enrichment. Azimuthal metallicity asymmetries are detected, with flatter gradients in the eastern and southern quadrants and steeper ones in the north and west. They are consistent with tidal interaction effects from the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). Finally, in spite of a clear distance and velocity bifurcations in the east, they seem to share a common chemical origin, in agreement with other studies.

 - **Abstract**
 Models describing dark matter as a novel particle often predict that its annihilation or decay into Standard Model particles could produce a detectable neutrino flux in regions of high dark matter density, such as the Galactic Center. In this work, we search for these neutrinos using $\sim$9 years of IceCube-DeepCore data with an event selection optimized for energies between 15 GeV to 200 GeV. We considered several annihilation and decay channels and dark matter masses ranging from 15 GeV up to 8 TeV. No significant deviation from the background expectation from atmospheric neutrinos and muons was found. The most significant result was found for a dark matter mass of 201.6 GeV annihilating into a pair of $b\bar{b}$ quarks assuming the Navarro-Frenk-White halo profile with a post-trial significance of $1.08 \;\sigma$. We present upper limits on the thermally-averaged annihilation cross-section of the order of $10^{-24} \mathrm{cm}^3 \mathrm{s}^{-1}$, as well as lower limits on the dark matter decay lifetime up to $10^{26} \mathrm{s}$ for dark matter masses between 5 GeV up to 8 TeV. These results strengthen the current IceCube limits on dark matter masses above 20 GeV and provide an order of magnitude improvement at lower masses. In addition, they represent the strongest constraints from any neutrino telescope on GeV-scale dark matter and are among the world-leading limits for several dark matter scenarios.

 - **Abstract**
 Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are enigmatic radio pulses whose origins are poorly understood. The dispersion measure of host galaxy (${\rm DM_{host}}$) provides critical insights into the local environment of FRB sources. In this study, we analyze a sample of 117 well-localized FRBs to investigate the statistical properties of ${\rm DM_{host}}$ and its potential correlations with host galaxy parameters, including redshift, stellar mass, star formation rate (SFR), and galaxy age. Our results reveal that ${\rm DM_{host}}$ is consistent with a log-normal distribution, with the mean $\mu_{\rm host}=5.03\pm 0.02$ and standard deviation $\sigma_{\rm host} = 0.96\pm 0.03$, which corresponds to a median value ${\rm Med}({\rm DM_{host}})=\exp(\mu_{\rm host})=153\pm 3~{\rm pc~cm^{-3}}$. We find a moderate positive correlation between ${\rm DM_{host}}$ and redshift, but no statistically significant correlations are found between ${\rm DM_{host}}$ and stellar mass, SFR, or galaxy age. Our findings highlight the importance of ${\rm DM_{host}}$ as a diagnostic tool for unraveling FRB origins, and underscore the need for future FRB surveys with deep multiwavelength host galaxy follow-up.
#### Limits on forming coreless terrestrial worlds in the TRAPPIST-1 system

 - **Abstract**
 With seven temperate Earth-sized planets revolving around an ultracool red dwarf, the nearby TRAPPIST-1 system offers a unique opportunity to verify models of exoplanet composition, differentiation, and interior structure. In particular, the low bulk densities of the TRAPPIST-1 planets, compared to terrestrial planets in our solar system, require either substantial amount of volatiles to be present or a corefree scenario where the metallic core is fully oxidised. Here, using an updated metal-silicate partitioning model, we show that during core-mantle differentiation oxygen becomes more siderophile (iron-loving) implying larger planet radii. For the seven TRAPPIST-1 planets, however, we find that they are not sufficiently large to oxidise all the iron in the core, if they differentiate from an Earth-like composition. Oxygen partitioning in rocky worlds precludes coreless planets up to about 4 Earth masses. The observed density deficit in the TRAPPIST-1 planets, and more generally in M dwarf systems if confirmed by future observations, may be explained by system-dependent element budgets during planet formation, which are intrinsically linked to their stellar metallicity.
#### The ALMA-QUARKS survey: Hot Molecular Cores are a long-standing phenomenon in the evolution of massive protostars

 - **Abstract**
 We present an analysis of the QUARKS survey sample, focusing on protoclusters where Hot Molecular Cores (HMCs, traced by CH3CN(12--11)) and UC HII regions (traced by H30\alpha/H40\alpha) coexist. Using the high-resolution, high-sensitivity 1.3 mm data from the QUARKS survey, we identify 125 Hot Molecular Fragments (HMFs), which represent the substructures of HMCs at higher resolution. From line integrated intensity maps of CH3CN(12--11) and H30\alpha, we resolve the spatial distribution of HMFs and UC HII regions. By combining with observations of CO outflows and 1.3 mm continuum, we classify HMFs into four types: HMFs associated with jet-like outflow, with wide-angle outflow, with non-detectable outflow, and shell-like HMFs near UC HII regions. This diversity possibly indicates that the hot core could be polymorphic and long-standing phenomenon in the evolution of massive protostars. The separation between HMFs and H30\alpha/H40\alpha emission suggests that sequential high-mass star formation within young protoclusters is not likely related to feedback mechanisms.

 - **Abstract**
 Broad absorption line (BAL) quasars serve as critical probes for understanding active galactic nucleus (AGN) outflows, black hole accretion, and cosmic evolution. To address the limitations of manual classification in large-scale spectroscopic surveys - where the number of quasar spectra is growing exponentially - we propose BALNet, a deep learning approach consisting of a one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) and bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) networks to automatically detect BAL troughs in quasar spectra. BALNet enables both the identification of BAL quasars and the measurement of their BAL troughs. We construct a simulated dataset for training and testing by combining non-BAL quasar spectra and BAL troughs, both derived from SDSS DR16 observations. Experimental results in the testing set show that: (1) BAL trough detection achieves 83.0% completeness, 90.7% purity, and an F1-score of 86.7%; (2) BAL quasar classification achieves 90.8% completeness and 94.4% purity; (3) the predicted BAL velocities agree closely with simulated ground truth labels, confirming BALNet's robustness and accuracy. When applied to the SDSS DR16 data within the redshift range 1.5<z<5.7, at least one BAL trough is detected in 20.4% of spectra. Notably, more than a quarter of these are newly identified sources with significant absorption, 8.8% correspond to redshifted systems, and some narrow/weak absorption features were missed. BALNet greatly improves the efficiency of large-scale BAL trough detection and enables more effective scientific analysis of quasar spectra.

 - **Abstract**
 Plasma flow measurements in solar active region filaments are rare, particularly in the infrared and ultraviolet ranges that probe the chromosphere and transition region. In addition, previous studies generally focused on prominences and filaments near the solar limb. This study presents a multi-wavelength, multi-instrument analysis of an active region filament observed on the solar disk on November 9 and 10, 2020. Our goal is to characterize the plasma flows in the filament using spectroscopic measurements in both the infrared and ultraviolet spectral ranges. This is important for understanding the mechanisms for filament support, mass loading, and energy balance. Furthermore, this also offers observational benchmarks for filament modeling and simulations. Spectra from the IRIS satellite, including the Mg II k, C II and Si IV lines were analyzed alongside ground-based observations from the GREGOR Infrared Spectrograph and High-resolution Fast Imager instruments whose observed spectral ranges include the chromospheric He I and H{\alpha} lines. Persistent blueshifts were measured within the filament structure in both spectral ranges. These can be interpreted as upflow velocities ranging from 0.5 to 15 km s^-1, with the Si IV showing the highest values. Red shifted emission in the He I and Mg II k3 at the footpoints of a newly formed dark bundle suggest chromospheric downflows, likely due to spatial overlap between an arch filament system close to the filament footpoints. The weak redshifted signal in the Si IV emission may suggest confinement to lower atmospheric layers. The observed velocity patterns provide, for the first time, a comprehensive and coherent view of the plasma dynamics from the chromosphere to the transition region, illustrating that the filament emission is consistently blueshifted in all the spectral windows, and thus in different temperature regimes.
#### Derivative-Aligned Anticipation of Forbush Decreases from Entropy and Fractal Markers

 - **Abstract**
 We present a feature-based framework to anticipate Forbush decreases (FDs) from one-minute neutron-monitor data by tracking sliding-window invariants from information theory, scaling, and geometry. For each station and event, we compute marker series (Shannon, spectral, permutation, sample and approximate entropy; Lempel-Ziv complexity; Hurst via DFA; correlation dimension; Higuchi, Katz, and Petrosian fractal dimensions), smooth them with an exponentially weighted moving average, and analyze within-station standardized derivatives relative to the time of the minimum of the smoothed count derivative. Leads are reported in minutes (negative = precedes) and station-level significance is defined on a pre-onset window via a robust z-score detector with bilateral threshold and persistence; no cross-correlation or hypothesis testing is required. Applied to three recent FDs (2023-04-23, 2024-03-24, 2024-05-10), a compact, robust panel-Hurst (DFA), Katz fractal dimension, Shannon and sample entropy, and Lempel-Ziv-consistently precedes the count derivative with substantial station coverage, yielding actionable lead times from tens to several hundred minutes depending on morphology. Some descriptors are event-dependent: permutation and spectral entropy are strongly anticipatory in the extreme May 2024 episode but closer to contemporaneous in the rapid March 2024 case. Heatmaps, violin plots, and station overlays corroborate these patterns. The approach is reproducible from open code, operates on native station units without cross-station homogenization, and is qualitatively stable to window, smoothing, and detector settings. These results support derivative-aligned invariant panels as practical early-warning tools that complement amplitude thresholds and enable nowcasting workflows in space-weather operations.
#### Populations of tidal and pulsating variables in eclipsing binaries

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we seek to characterise a large sample of 14377 main sequence eclipsing binaries in terms of their stellar, asteroseismic, and orbital properties. We conduct manual vetting on a 4000-target subset of our full 14377-target sample to identify targets with pressure or gravity modes. We infer stellar properties including the mass, convective core mass, radius, and central H fraction for the primary using Gaia Data Release 3 effective temperature and luminosity estimates and a grid of asteroseismically calibrated stellar models. We use surface brightness ratio and radius ratio estimates from previous eclipse analysis to study the effect of binarity on our results. Our manual vetting identifies 751 candidate g-mode pulsators, 131 p-mode pulsators, and a further 48 hybrid pulsators. The inferred stellar properties of the hybrid and p-mode pulsators are highly correlated, while the orbital properties of the hybrid pulsators align best with the g-mode pulsators. The g-mode pulsators themselves show a distribution that peaks around the classical g dor instability region but extends continuously towards higher masses, with no detectable divide between the classical g dor and SPB instability regions. There is evidence at the population level for a heightened level of tidal efficiency in stars showing g-mode or hybrid variability. Correcting the primary mass inference for binarity based on eclipse measurements of the surface brightness and radius ratios results in a relatively small shift towards lower masses. This work provides a working initial characterisation of this sample from which more detailed analyses folding in asteroseismic information can be built. It also provides a foundational understanding of the limitations and capabilities of this kind of rapid, scalable analysis that will be highly relevant in planning the exploitation of future large-scale binary surveys.

 - **Abstract**
 Space missions (CHEOPS, JWST, PLATO) facilitate detailed characterization of exoplanets. This work provides a framework to characterize cloud and climate properties of close-in gas giants via transit depth asymmetries from the optical to the infrared (0.33 ...10 $\mu$m). The AFGKM ExoRad 3D GCM grid provides gas temperature profiles for an ensemble of 50 tidally locked gaseous planets orbiting diverse host stars. It is combined with a detailed kinetic cloud formation model. The end result is a set of synthetic transit spectra and evening-to-morning transit asymmetries that span climate regimes: warm (T=800 K ... 1000K), intermediately hot (T=1200 K ... 2000 K) and ultrahot (T =2200 K ... 2600 K). WASP-39b observations suggest iron-free clouds with less abundant cloud condensation nuclei than previously expected. The ensemble study shows that clouds increase transit limb differences due to asymmetries in cloud coverage and by enhancing horizontal differences in the gas temperatures. For hot planets, evening-to-morning differences of up to 150 ppm are suggested in the optical and 100 ppm in the infrared (2-8 micron). For ultra-hot Jupiters, evening-to-morning transit differences are dominated by the morning cloud for a cloud-free evening limb: They are strongly negative in the PLATO band (0.5-1~$\mu$m, -500 ppm), moderately negative in the near-infrared (1-1.5~$\mu$m, -200 ppm) and moderately positive (+100 ppm) for $\lambda > 2\mu$m. For a partly cloudy evening terminator, the evening-to-morning transit asymmetry is moderately positive in the whole wavelength range. Warm Jupiter planets exhibit negligible transit asymmetries. PLATO and JWST transit asymmetry observations between 1-2 $\mu$m are optimal to characterize cloudy planetary atmospheres around K -A stars. JWST observations are most effective for M star planets with transit differences > +500 ppm for 8-10 $\mu$m.

 - **Abstract**
 The CCAT Observatory's Fred Young Submillimeter Telescope, a novel, high-throughput, 6-meter aperture telescope, is scheduled for first light in 2026. Located at 5600 m on Cerro Chajnantor in the Chilean Atacama Desert, the CCAT site enables unprecedented submillimeter measurement capabilities, fully overlapping with millimeter-wave surveys like the Simons Observatory. CCAT will address a suite of science goals, from Big Bang cosmology, star formation, and line-intensity mapping of cosmic reionization, to galactic magnetic fields, transients, and galaxy evolution over cosmic time. We highlight CCAT's science goals with Prime-Cam, a first generation science instrument for the Fred Young Submillimeter Telescope. Prime-Cam will field over 100,000 kinetic inductance detectors across seven instrument modules to enable over ten times faster mapping speed than previous submillimeter observatories in windows between 1.4 - 0.3 mm (220 - 850 GHz). We give an instrument summary, discuss the project status, and outline preliminary plans for early science.

 - **Abstract**
 We present near-infrared scattered-light observations of the disks around two stars of the Corona Australis star-forming region, V721 CrA, and BN CrA, obtained with VLT/SPHERE, in the H band, as part of the DESTINYS large programme. Our objective is to analyse the morphology of these disks, and highlight their main properties. We adopt an analytical axisymmetric disk model to fit the observations and perform a regression on key disk parameters, namely the dust mass, the height profile, and the inclination. We use RADMC-3D code to produce synthetic observations of the analytical models, with full polarised scattering treatment. Both stars show resolved and extended disks with substructures in the near-IR. The disk of V721 CrA is vertically thicker, radially smaller (120 au), and brighter than BN CrA (190 au). It also shows spiral arms in the inner regions. The disk of BN CrA shows a dark circular lane, which could be either an intrinsic dust gap or a self-cast shadow, and a brightness enhancement along the disk minor axis. Both disks are compatible with the evolutionary stage of their parent subgroup within the CrA region: V721 CrA belongs to the "on-cloud" part of CrA, which is dustier, denser and younger, whereas BN CrA is found on the outskirts of the older "off-cloud" group.

 - **Abstract**
 Mercury's core mass fraction (CMF) is ~0.7, more than double that of the other rocky planets in the solar system, which have CMFs of ~0.3. The origin of Mercury's large, iron-rich core remains unknown. Adding to this mystery, an elusive population of "Exo-Mercuries" with high densities is emerging. Therefore, understanding the formation of Mercury and its exoplanetary analogs is essential to developing a comprehensive planet formation theory. Two hypotheses have been proposed to explain the high CMF of Mercury: (1) giant impacts during the latest stages of planet formation strip away mantle layers, leaving Mercury with a large core; and (2) earlier-stage iron enrichment of planetesimals closer to the Sun leads to the formation of an iron-rich planet. In this work, we conduct N-body simulations to test these two possibilities. Our simulations are focused on the solar system, however, we aim to provide a framework that can later be applied to the formation of high-CMF exoplanets. To investigate the giant impact scenario, we employ uniform initial CMF distributions. To address the other hypothesis, we use a step function with higher CMFs in the inner region. For a uniform initial CMF distribution, our results indicate that although erosive impacts produce iron-rich particles, without mechanisms that deplete stripped mantle material, these particles merge with lower-CMF objects and do not lead to Mercury's elevated CMF. However, a step function initial CMF distribution leads to the formation of a high-CMF planet alongside Earth-like planets, resembling the architecture of the terrestrial solar system.

 - **Abstract**
 Core-collapse supernovae, occurring at the end of massive star evolution, produce heavy elements, including those in the iron peak. Although the explosion mechanism is not yet fully understood, theoretical models can reproduce optical observations and observed elemental abundances. However, many nuclear reaction rates involved in explosive nucleosynthesis have large uncertainties, impacting the reliability of abundance predictions. To address this, we have previously developed a Monte Carlo-based nucleosynthesis code that accounts for reaction rate uncertainties and has been applied to nucleosynthesis processes beyond iron. Our framework is also well suited for studying explosive nucleosynthesis in supernovae. In this paper, we investigate 1D explosion models using the "PUSH method", focusing on progenitors with varying metallicities and initial masses around $M_\mathrm{ZAMS} = 16 M_{\odot}$. Detailed post-process nucleosynthesis calculations and Monte Carlo analyses are used to explore the effects of reaction rate uncertainties and to identify key reaction rates in explosive nucleosynthesis. We find that many reactions have little impact on the production of iron-group nuclei, as these elements are primarily synthesized in the nuclear statistical equilibrium. However, we identify a few "key reactions" that significantly influence the production of radioactive nuclei, which may affect astrophysical observables. In particular, for the production of ${}^{44}$Ti, we confirm that several traditionally studied nuclear reactions have a strong impact. However, determining a single reaction rate is insufficient to draw a definitive conclusion.

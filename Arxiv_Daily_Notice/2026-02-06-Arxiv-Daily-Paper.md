 - **Abstract**
 The realization that primordial black holes (PBHs) might be some fraction of the dark matter begged the question, how often do PBHs enter the solar system? For a Neptune radius solar system the answer is, rarely. For an Oort cloud sized system the answer is different. Simulations of bombardment of the Oort cloud by dark matter suggest that dislodgement of protocomets and their entry into the inner solar system can match the observed frequency of comets, if that PBH fraction is high enough. Comets were traditionally considered as messengers, usually omens. After 50 years of puzzlement regarding dark matter, we need a hint from the dark universe about the size and nature of dark matter particles.

 - **Abstract**
 Hydrocarbons play a key role in shaping the chemistry of the interstellar medium (ISM), but their enrichment and relationship with carbonaceous grains and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) still lack clear observational constraints. We report JWST NIRSpec+MIRI/MRS infrared (IR; 3-28 micron) observations of the local ultra-luminous IR galaxy (ULIRG) IRAS 07251-0248, revealing the extragalactic detection of small gas-phase hydrocarbons such as benzene (C$_6$H$_6$), triacetylene (C$_6$H$_2$), diacetylene (C$_4$H$_2$), acetylene (C$_2$H$_2$), methane (CH$_4$), and methyl radical (CH$_3$) as well as deep amorphous C-H absorptions in the solid phase. The unexpectedly high abundance of these molecules indicates an extremely rich hydrocarbon chemistry, not explained by high-temperature gas-phase chemistry, ice desorption or oxygen depletion. Instead, the most plausible explanation is the erosion and fragmentation of carbonaceous grains and PAHs. This scenario is supported by the correlation between the abundance of one of their main fragmentation products, C$_2$H$_2$, and cosmic ray (CR) ionization rate for a sample of local ULIRGs. These hydrocarbons are outflowing at $\sim$160 km/s, which may represent a potential formation pathway for hydrogenated amorphous grains. Our results suggest that IRAS 07251-0248 might not be unique but represents an extreme example of the commonly rich hydrocarbon chemistry prevalent in deeply obscured galactic nuclei.
#### Dynamics of the coronal magnetic field in the 2022-10-02 X-class flare
 - **Authors:** Gregory D. Fleishman, Tatyana Kaltman, Sijie Yu

 - **Abstract**
 Solar flares are driven by release of free magnetic energy and often associated with restructurization of the magnetic field topology. Yet, observations of evolving magnetic field in the flaring volume are limited to very few cases including the 2017-09-10 X8.2 limb flare; thus, a verification of whether a similar evolution takes place in other solar flares is needed. Here we report one more, 2022-10-02, X1.1 class solar flare but seen on disk, whose microwave data permit mapping the magnetic field over the flaring source and tracking magnetic field evolution over the course of the flare. We found that the coronal magnetic field shows a prominent decay with the rate up to 10 G s$^{-1}$ in several (above) loop-top locations. The magnetic field is also confidently measured at the loop legs and the bottom part of the erupting filament. Prominent acceleration of electrons is detected where the magnetic field decays. We developed 3D models of the flare, whose magnetic field shows resemblance and also deviation from the magnetic field inferred from the microwave data. This study confirms that the coronal magnetic field decays during the rise phase of the solar flare. The amount of released magnetic energy is sufficient to support other components of the flare energy.
#### Rotating strange dwarfs and their indistinguishability from white dwarfs

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05177

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.05177

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the structure of strange dwarfs, modeled as hybrid compact stars composed of a self bound strange quark matter core surrounded by a white dwarf like crust, within a fully relativistic framework. Static configurations are constructed by solving the Tolman Oppenheimer Volkoff equations, and uniformly rotating configurations are modeled within the Hartle Thorne slow rotation expansion (to ${\cal O}(\Omega^2)$). We therefore interpret results at large fractional spins conservatively, and use the Kepler frequency mainly as a reference scale for comparing different masses and models. The stellar matter is described using a hybrid equation of state, in which the crust is modeled by a degenerate electron ion system and the core by the MIT Bag Model. By comparing strange dwarfs with conventional white dwarfs across a range of rotation rates, we show that rotation inflates the radius and can reduce (in a quantifiable way) the separation between the two families in the $(M,R)$ plane, potentially masking structural signatures associated with the presence of a quark core. Our results highlight the importance of accounting for rotational effects when interpreting mass radius measurements and other global observables in the context of searches for exotic compact objects in current and future high precision surveys.
#### IFU Spectroscopic Study of the Planetary Nebula Abell 30: Mapping the Ionisation and Kinematic Structure of the Inner Complex

 - **Abstract**
 This work presents integrated flux and velocity channel maps of the planetary nebula Abell 30 (A30) inner knot system. The observations were taken with the INTEGRAL spectrograph at the William Herschel Telescope (WHT). Our IFU data cube partially covers knots J1, J2, and completely covers knots J3, J4 in the system. Optical Recombination Lines of C II, He I, He II, N III, O II and Collisionally Excited Lines of [Ar IV], [Ar V], [N II], [Ne III], [Ne IV], and [O III] were detected. Our integrated flux maps visualise the ionisation structure and the chemical inhomogeneity in the system previously reported by other groups. We find that ORLs are concentrated in the polar region (J1, J3), whereas the equatorial knots (J2, J4) are dominated by CELs. The flux ratio map of the diagnostic [O III] lambda 5007/4363 Angstrom lines reveals the electron temperature distribution, which shows cold cores of 15,000 K in knots J3 and J4 surrounded by a hot outer layer of above 20,000 K. Our channel maps show positive and negative velocity excursions from the systemic value among the ions. Several ions show variation in their velocity structures from their lower-energy-level counterparts, including [Ar IV] and [Ar V], [Ne III] and [Ne IV], and He I and He II. New recurrent velocity structures are identified in the low-density regions where the ions move much faster compared to their surrounding environments. The velocity dispersion measurements highlight extreme turbulence in some of the ions (sigma_vrad approx 140 km/s), consistent with supersonic/hypersonic motion driven by shocks. The forbidden line species [N II] exhibits lower turbulence (sigma_vrad approx 50-60 km/s), tracing denser, less-turbulent gases. Based on our data, we conclude both the ionisation and kinematic studies hint at shock heating and multiple ejection history in the evolutionary pathway of A30.
#### Sulfur Enrichment in Close-in Exoplanet Atmospheres Induced by Pebble Drift across the Salt Line

 - **Abstract**
 Observations of JWST have revealed that several close-in exoplanets have sulfur-rich atmospheres through SO$_2$ detections. Atmospheric sulfur is often thought to originate from solid accretion during planet formation, whereas recent simultaneous detections of SO$_2$ and NH$_3$ challenge this conventional scenario. In this study, we propose that ammonium salts, such as NH$_4$SH tentatively detected in comets and molecular clouds, play a significant role in producing sulfur-rich disk gases, which serve as the ingredient of giant planet atmospheres. We simulated the radial transport of dust containing volatile ices and ammonium salts, along with the dissociation, sublimation, and recondensation of these materials, thereby predicting the atmospheric chemical structures and transmission spectra of planets inheriting these compositions. Assuming that ammonium salts sequester 20% of the elemental nitrogen and sulfur budgets, our results reveal that they enhance sulfur and nitrogen abundances in disk gases to 2-10 times the solar values near the salt dissociation line. Photochemical simulations demonstrate that SO$_2$, NS, H$_2$S, NO, and NH$_3$ become the dominant N and S chemical species in the atmospheres on planets that inherited the gas compositions inside H$_2$O snowline. SO$_2$ features clearly appear in the infrared transmission spectra when the salt-bearing grains enhance the sulfur abundance of disk gas by pebble drift. Our model provides a novel scenario that explains the SO$_2$ detected in some exoplanet atmospheres solely from disk gas accretion. Volatile-element ratios, particularly N/S and C/O, would provide a key to disentangle our scenario from the conventional solid-accretion scenario.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the relative alignment between density structures and magnetic fields in eight young protostars from the ALMA B-field Orion Protostellar Survey. Column density maps are derived from 870 $\mu$m dust continuum emission, and the Histogram of Relative Orientations (HRO) method is applied to quantify the correlation between magnetic field orientations and density structures on envelope scales ($\sim$10$^{3}$~au). We find that the relative alignment shows overall weak evidence of systematic evolution with column density, suggesting that column density alone does not fully determine the alignment. The magnetization level also plays a crucial role, with weakly magnetized envelopes exhibiting predominantly parallel or random alignment, whereas strongly magnetized ones show perpendicular configurations even at moderate densities. These results reveal that density and magnetization jointly shape the morphology of protostellar envelopes and the coupling between gravity and magnetic fields during early stages of star formation.

 - **Abstract**
 The chemical evolution in star forming regions is driven by the interplay between gas and ice mantles. Identifying the ice compositions at the early stage of star formation thus provides constraints on the chemical processes inaccessible from gas-phase characterizations. As part of the CORINOS program, spectra from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) MIRI MRS were taken toward four Class 0 protostars: IRAS 15398-3359, Ser-emb7, L483, and B335. The spectra were processed with simultaneous fitting of a continuum and silicate absorption to produce optical depth mid-infrared spectra of the ices at 5-28 $\mu$m (360-2000 cm$^{-1}$) toward these four sources. Simple molecules such as water (H$_2$O), carbon dioxide (CO$_2$), methanol (CH$_3$OH), formic acid/formate (HCOOH/HCOO$^-$), ammonia/ammonium (NH$_3$/NH$_4$$^+$), and formaldehyde (H$_2$CO) are the most abundant features in these ices, while complex organic molecules (COMs) represent a smaller contribution. Likely COMs include hydroxylamine (NH$_2$OH), methylamine (CH$_3$NH$_2$), and ethanol (CH$_3$CH$_2$OH). Absorption features belonging to functional groups such as -CH$_3$ and -OH suggest that additional COMs are present, but these cannot be unambiguously assigned due to overlapping bands. Formation pathways toward these COMs utilizing radical-radical combination reactions based on laboratory simulation experiments is presented. By extension, COMs predicted by these reactions, but absent from the spectra, are discussed. The results provide insight into the chemical environment of these ices and also highlight the critical need for caution and sufficient evidence in order to confidently identify COMs in ice.

 - **Abstract**
 Integral field spectroscopy (IFS) provides spatially resolved spectra, enabling detailed studies that address the physical and kinematic properties of the interstellar medium. A critical step in analyzing IFS data is the decomposition of emission lines, where different velocity components are often modeled with Gaussian profiles. However, conventional fitting methods that treat each spectrum independently often yield spatial discontinuities in the fitting results. Here, we present Emission Line Fitting Optimization (ELFO), a Python package for IFS spectral fitting. ELFO uses the results of neighboring spectra to determine multiple initial guesses and selects the result that exhibits spatial smoothness. We tested ELFO on IFS data of two quasars obtained from the Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer, where it successfully corrected anomalous fits, revealed previously unresolved substructures, and made large-scale kinematic structures more evident. With minor modifications, this method can also be easily adapted to other IFS data and different emission lines.
#### Mergers Drive Structural Complexity but Not Starbursts in Lyman-$α$ Emitters at $3 < z < 4$: A JWST Spatially Resolved View

 - **Abstract**
 Recent observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) reveal that the merger fraction among Ly$\alpha$ emitters (LAEs) at redshifts $z > 3$ is significantly higher than previously estimated. In this study, we focus on three high signal-to-noise merging LAE systems at $3 < z < 4$, selected from the VLT/MUSE-Deep survey in the GOODS-S field. We combine new \textit{JWST}/NIRCam broadband and medium-band imaging with archival \textit{HST}/ACS data to perform spatially resolved spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting using the \textsc{Bagpipes} software package. Our analysis reveals that two of the systems are minor mergers, while the third is a major merger. The close agreement between spatially resolved and integrated stellar mass estimates indicates that recent star formation does not significantly outshine the light from older stellar populations in these systems. Moreover, both the individual components and the systems as a whole lie on the star-forming main sequence, further supporting the conclusion that these mergers have not yet triggered substantial starburst activity. Furthermore, we detect prominent color gradients and disturbed dust distributions in these merging systems, indicating that the mergers have already induced significant internal structural perturbations. These morphological and dust-related changes may facilitate the escape of Ly$\alpha$ photons -- potentially through mechanisms such as gas redistribution or a reduced covering fraction of neutral hydrogen -- thereby playing a key role in shaping the observed properties of LAEs.
#### The Correlation Length of Turbulence in Magnetic Clouds

 - **Abstract**
 The large-scale limit or outer scale of turbulence in the solar wind is associated with the correlation length of the magnetic field. Determining correlation lengths from magnetic field time series in magnetic clouds is complicated by the presence of the global flux rope: without removal of the flux rope trend, correlation length measurements will be sensitive to the flux rope as well as the turbulence, and give overestimates of the outer scale when turbulence amplitudes at the outer scale are small relative to the flux rope amplitude. We have used force-free flux rope fits to detrend magnetic field time series measured by Parker Solar Probe in two magnetic clouds and calculated the turbulence correlation length in the clouds using the detrended data. The detrended correlation length in terms of the proton inertial length, $d_p$, was $2.7\times10^{4} d_p$ in one cloud (observed at 0.77 au) and $1.6\times10^{4}d_p$ in the other (observed at 0.39 au), significantly smaller than the values obtained without detrending. Increments in the flux rope fits scaled equivalently to a $k^{-3}$ wavenumber power spectrum; this contribution from the flux rope considerably steepened the total spectrum at the largest scales but had a negligible effect in the inertial range, where scaling in both clouds equivalent to $\sim$$k^{-5/3}$ was observed. Finally, we discuss the possible relation of turbulence correlation lengths to mesoscale structure in magnetic clouds.
#### Photometric variability of nitrogen-rich Wolf-Rayet stars in Magellanic Clouds with OGLE

 - **Abstract**
 We present a comprehensive analysis of the photometric variability of (presumably single) nitrogen-rich Wolf-Rayet (WN) stars in the Magellanic Clouds, using long-term observations from the OGLE survey. Our sample comprises 47 stars with no nearby Gaia counterparts. We characterize both overall and short-term variabilities, examining data dispersion and identifying periodicities. To validate our findings, we also compare the OGLE light curves with data from the MACHO and TESS missions. Variability is ubiquitous in our WR sample: about one third of stars display high variability, or four fifths if we include cases with moderate variations. The observed changes are found to be periodic in 11 cases, with timescales of 2-56 d. Such periodic variations originate in corotating wind structures, binary effects, or pulsations, thereby increasing the number of systems known to show these phenomena. Surprisingly, nine targets display (quasi-periodic) outbursts, making such changes a new type of WR variability. The variability shows a transient character, in about 30$\%$ of the sample, with changing amplitudes for periodic signals or for outbursts (they even sometimes completely disappear from view). Finally, we identified six long-period variables, four of which have been confirmed by at least two independent surveys.
#### Microlensing constraint on Primordial Black Hole abundance with Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam observations of Andromeda

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05840

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.05840

 - **Abstract**
 We present updated microlensing analysis results based on high-cadence ($\sim$2~min) Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) observations of the Andromeda Galaxy (M31) in 2014, 2017, and 2020, yielding a total of 39.3 hours of data. We use a point-lens finite-source model for the microlensing light curve model and employ multi-stage selection procedures to identify microlensing candidates. From more than 25,000 variable candidates detected across all nights, we identify 12 microlensing candidates with light-curve timescales shorter than 5~hours, and among them, 4 secure candidates with high-significance detections. We estimate detection efficiencies using light-curve-level simulations that account for observational conditions and finite-source effects. Using a hierarchical Bayesian framework that combines the light-curve fitting information for each candidate with the Poisson statistics of the number of candidates, we derive constraints on parameters that characterize the abundance and mass scale of primordial black hole (PBH) dark matter. First, we derive upper limits on the PBH abundance under the null hypothesis that all events are assumed to be false detections. Next, employing the PBH hypothesis in which all (or only secure) candidates are assumed to be due to PBH microlensing, we derive the allowed region of the PBH parameters; the inferred mass scale is $M_{\rm PBH}\sim10^{-7}$--$10^{-6}M_\odot$, and the PBH abundance to the total dark matter is $f_{\rm PBH}\sim \mathcal{O}(10^{-2}{\rm -}10^{-1})$. Our results demonstrate that HSC-M31 monitoring remains a uniquely powerful probe of PBHs, and highlight the need for further studies for example, using Rubin Observatory LSST observations of the Large Magellanic Cloud.

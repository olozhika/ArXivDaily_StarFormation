 - **Abstract**
 Stripped stars are hot, helium-rich stars formed when binary interactions remove a star's hydrogen envelope. While low-mass ($\lesssim 1\,M_\odot$) and high-mass ($\gtrsim 8\,M_\odot$) stripped stars are well studied as hot subdwarfs and Wolf-Rayet stars, their intermediate-mass counterparts ($1-8 \,M_\odot$) have only recently been discovered. The Stripped-Star Ultraviolet Magellanic Cloud Survey (SUMS) identified UV-excess sources in the Magellanic Clouds using Swift-UVOT photometry and selected 820 photometric stripped-star candidates. However, the selection function, completeness, and purity of this sample remain poorly understood. We forward model the population of stripped stars in the Magellanic Clouds using a binary population synthesis model combined with spatially resolved star formation histories and simulated UV photometry. To assess survey sensitivity, we inject simulated sources into real Swift-UVOT images and reproduce the SUMS selection process, including crowding, extinction, and photometric quality cuts. We recover $\sim 250$ simulated stripped stars with masses $\gtrsim 1\,M_{\odot}$, which corresponds to a recover rate of $9-13\,\%$. The rest are missed due to dilution by luminous companions, crowding, and high extinction. The observed population is biased toward systems with low-mass companions formed by common envelope evolution and toward systems with compact object companions. Of the stripped stars which show UV excess, $25-45\,\%$ are identifiable by SUMS; higher-resolution data or improved reddening corrections are needed to detect the rest. We predict contamination of the observed stripped star candidates by main-sequence stars with spurious UV excess due to crowding and provide guidelines for selecting higher-purity subsamples. These results enable tests of binary evolution models and realistic comparison of observed and simulated stripped-star populations.

 - **Abstract**
 Observations have shown that the optical colors of Galactic cirrus clouds differ significantly from those of extragalactic sources; thus, they can be used to distinguish Galactic cirrus from extragalactic low surface brightness (LSB) features. To understand these properties, we calculate radiative transfer models in dust clouds, where photons are incident from the ambient interstellar medium (ISM). Dust clouds are modeled to mimic a turbulent medium using a fractional Brownian motion algorithm, resulting in a lognormal density distribution and a power-law power spectral density that are appropriate for the ISM. The results are compared with optical observations of cirrus clouds in the Stripe 82 region. The observed color--color ($g-r$, $r-i$, and $i-z$) diagrams of the cirrus clouds can be reproduced by scattered light if the interstellar radiation field (ISRF) of Mathis et al. (as updated by Draine) is modified, either by reducing the intensities in the $i$ and $z$ bands or by enhancing those in the $g$ and $r$ bands. Similar results can also be obtained by adjusting the scattering albedos at the corresponding wavelengths. This demonstrates that the color--color diagrams are effective not only for identifying extragalactic LSB features but also for studying the ISRF and the properties of interstellar dust.

 - **Abstract**
 Surrounding Sgr A*, a cluster of young and massive stars coexist with a population of dust-enshrouded objects, whose astrometric data can be used to scrutinize the nature of Sgr A*. An alternative to the black hole (BH) scenario has been recently proposed in terms of a supermassive compact object composed of self-gravitating fermionic dark matter (DM). Such horizon-less configurations can reproduce the relativistic effects measured for S2 orbit, while being part of a single continuous configuration whose extended halo reproduces the latest GAIA-DR3 rotation curve. In this work, we statistically compare different fermionic DM configurations aimed to fit the astrometric data of S2, and five G-sources, and compare with the BH potential when appropriate. We sample the parameter spaces via Markov Chain Monte Carlo statistics and perform a quantitative comparison estimating Bayes factors for models that share the same likelihood function. We extend previous results of the S2 and G2 orbital fits for 56 keV fermions (low core-compactness) and show the results for 300 keV fermions (high core-compactness). For the selected S2 dataset, the former model is slightly favoured over the latter. However, more precise S2 datasets, as obtained by the GRAVITY instrument, remain to be analysed in light of the fermionic models. For the G-objects, no conclusive preference emerges between models. For all stellar objects tested, the BH and fermionic models predict orbital parameters that differ by less than 1%. More accurate data, particularly from stars closer to Sgr A*, is necessary to statistically distinguish between the models considered.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the photometric and spectroscopic analysis of the short-duration GRB 250221A ($T_{90}=1.80\pm0.32$ s), using a data set from the optical facilities COLIBRÍ, the Harlingten 50 cm Telescope, and the Very Large Telescope. We complement these observations with data from the \textit{Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory} and the \textit{Einstein Probe}, as well as radio observations from the Very Large Array. GRB 250221A is among the few short GRBs with direct afterglow spectroscopy, which gives a secure redshift determination of $z=0.768$ and allows the unambiguous identification of the host as a galaxy with a star-formation rate of $\sim3\,M_\odot\,{\rm yr}^{-1}$. The X-ray and optical light curves up to $T_0+10$ ks (where $T_0$ refers to the GRB trigger time) are well described by forward-shock synchrotron emission in the slow-cooling regime within the standard fireball framework. However, at $T_0+0.6$ days, both the X-ray and optical bands exhibit an excess over the same interval, which we interpret as evidence of energy injection into a jet with a half-opening angle of $\theta_j=11.5^{\circ}$ through a refreshed shock powered by late central engine activity or a radially stratified ejecta. The burst properties (duration, spectral hardness, peak energy, and location in the Amati plane) all favour a compact binary merger origin. However, our modelling of the afterglow suggests a dense circumburst medium ($n\sim80$ cm$^{-3}$), which is more typical of a Collapsar environment. This tension over the classification of this burst (short-hard vs. long-soft) as inferred from the prompt and afterglow emissions makes GRB~250221A an unusual event and underscores the limitations of duration-based classifications and the importance of multi-wavelength, time-resolved follow-up observations.

#### The impact of superradiance on the spin evolution of variably accreting massive black holes

 - **Abstract**
 This paper explores how time-varying increases in mass accretion onto rapidly spinning black holes influence their long-term spin evolution when affected by superradiance - a process where energy is extracted from the black hole by a surrounding axion field. Using simulations the study tracks how sudden accretion boosts affect a critical spin-down phase (the superradiance drop) during which the black hole's spin rapidly decreases while its mass remains nearly constant. The black hole spin evolution is controlled by the competition between two processes: how fast angular momentum is added through accretion, and how fast it is removed by the axion cloud. One major conclusion is that boosts to the accretion rate before the superradiance drop have the strongest effect, as they can delay or reshape the drop and significantly shrink the region of the mass-spin plane depopulated due to the superradiance. In particular, a super-Eddington accretion rate of 5 times Eddington accretion, lasting for 4 Myr and occurring 30 Myr before the superradiance drop can reduce the superradiance exclusion region in the mass-spin plane by 40 percent. In contrast, boosts to the accretion rate after the superradiance drop only cause temporary changes in the black hole spin. The study also shows that black holes with lighter axion clouds are more sensitive to these early boosts and can show observable spin changes lasting tens to hundreds of millions of years. Heavier axion clouds, however, require much stronger or longer-lasting boosts to produce similar effects, making them more stable under variable accretion.
#### Revisiting the Radio Lateral Distribution Function: An amplitude dependence on $X_{\rm max}$ and primary composition

 - **Abstract**
 We show that there is a strong dependence of the radio LDF electric field amplitudes at ground level on the position of $X_{\rm max}$ in the atmosphere, even accounting for differences in the EM energy of the showers. Since an $X_{\rm max}$ dependence leads to a primary composition dependence, this implies that information on the mass composition is encoded not only in the LDF shape but also in its amplitude. This $X_{\rm max}$ dependence can be explained in terms of two competing scalings of the measured electric field: One goes with $(1/\rho)^J$, where $\rho$ is the air density at $X_{\rm max}$ and $J$ is a zenith dependent non-linearity factor describing coherence loss. This density scaling tends to decrease the geomagnetic emission of deeper showers. The other scaling goes with $(1/R)$, where $R$ is the distance from $X_{\rm max}$ to the core at ground, and instead increases the measured electric field of deeper showers. At low zenith angles, the $(1/R)$ scaling is stronger and leads to larger measured electric fields as $X_{\rm max}$ increases. The picture at higher zeniths, i.e., lower densities, is more nuanced. In this region, the deflections due to the Lorentz force are much larger and introduce extra time delays between the particle tracks, decreasing the coherence of the emission. This loss of coherence is highly dependent on the strength of the geomagnetic field and can slow down, or even reverse the increase of the radio emission with decreasing air density. This strong, yet historically overlooked LDF amplitude dependence on $X_{\rm max}$/composition could be used to directly infer, even bypassing any $X_{\rm max}$ reconstruction, the cosmic ray primary composition on an event-by-event basis. It could also have some repercussions on other radio reconstruction methods, such as a possible $X_{\rm max}$/composition bias on shower electromagnetic energy reconstruction methods.
#### FAUST. XXVIII. High-Resolution ALMA Observations of Class 0/I Disks: Structure, Optical Depths, and Temperatures

 - **Abstract**
 We present high-resolution (~7.5 au) ALMA observations at 1.3 and 3 mm of 16 disks around Class 0/I protostars across multiple star-forming regions and a variety of multiplicities, showing a range of disk sizes (~2-100 au) and including circumbinary disks (CBDs) in binaries with separations <100 au. The disk properties show similarities to Class II disks, including (a) low spectral index (SI) values (alpha=2.1) that increase with disk radius, (b) 3 mm disk sizes only marginally smaller than at 1.3 mm (<10%), and (c) radial intensity profiles well described by modified self-similar profiles. We also find key differences: (i) SI values increasing with radius, but exceeding 2 only at the disk edge (ii) higher brightness temperatures Tb, in some cases higher than the predicted temperatures due to irradiation, and (iii) ~10x higher luminosity at a given size compared to the Class II disks. These results confirm significant optical depth in the observed Class 0/I disks, at both 1.3 and 3 mm, helping to explain their higher luminosities, but higher temperatures are also required for the most compact (< 40 au) disks, suggesting additional viscous heating. Considering optical depth, most disk dust masses are estimated in the range 30-900 Mearth (0.01-0.3 Msun in gas), resulting in some disks reaching marginal gravitational instability. The median location of the water iceline is ~3 au, but it can extend beyond 10-20 au for the hottest disks. CBDs exhibit lower optical depths at both wavelengths and hence higher SI values (alpha=3.0), dust masses of 100 Mearth, and beta~1.5 (2 Class 0 CBDs) and beta~1 (1 Class I CBD), suggesting substantial grain growth only in the more evolved CBD. The inferred high optical depths provide a compelling explanation for the apparent scarcity of dust substructures in the younger disks at ~ 1 mm, despite mounting evidence for early planet formation (ABRIDGED).
#### The magnetic sensitivity of the Ca II resonance and subordinate lines in the solar atmosphere

 - **Abstract**
 Aims: The polarization of the Ca II resonant doublet (H and K lines) and the subordinate infrared triplet lines are key observables for diagnosing solar chromospheric magnetism. It is thus necessary to understand the physical mechanisms that shape their Stokes profiles in magnetic environments. Methods: Using the spectral synthesis module of the HanleRT-TIC code, we study the effects of anisotropic radiation pumping with partial frequency redistribution (PRD) and J-state interference (JSI) in a plane-parallel semi-empirical static solar atmospheric model. We also analyze the sensitivity of these lines to magnetic fields of varying strengths and orientations, accounting for the combined action of the Hanle and Zeeman effects. Results: Including PRD is crucial to model the polarization in the core regions of the resonant lines, while JSI strongly affects their far wings. The metastable lower levels of the subordinate lines also influence the scattering polarization of the K line. With horizontal magnetic fields, the resonant lines respond to field strengths from sub-gauss to tens of gauss, whereas the infrared triplet scattering polarization is mainly sensitive to milligauss fields. At a near-limb line of sight (LOS) with $\mu = 0.1$, the Hanle effect modifies the scattering polarization via a depolarization and a rotation in the plane of linear polarization. At disk center, horizontal fields generate linear polarization in the 1D model: for the K line, the Hanle effect dominates from sub-gauss to a few tens of gauss, and the Zeeman effect dominates in stronger fields. For vertical fields, the Hanle effect vanishes, but magneto-optical effects affect the linear polarization wings. Finally, atomic level polarization impacts the outer circular polarization lobes of the resonant lines, and the weak-field approximation overestimates the LOS magnetic component in this frequency range.
#### Coupling of neutrino beam-driven MHD waves and resonant instabilities in rotating magnetoplasmas with neutrino two-flavor oscillations

 - **Abstract**
 We present an analysis of neutrino-driven magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves and instabilities in a rotating magnetoplasma with weak neutrino interactions. We show, for the first time, that neutrino-driven shear Alfv{é}n and oblique magnetosonic waves can be coupled by the Coriolis force, forming new wave modes affected by this force, as well as neutrino beam and two neutrino flavor oscillations. Our work extends previous theories by demonstrating that shear Alfv{é}n waves are influenced by neutrino effects and by identifying instabilities resulting from resonant interactions with both a streaming neutrino beam and flavor oscillations. We find that the Coriolis force, as well as plasma density and magnetic field strength, have a significant impact on the profiles of the instability growth rates. Our findings may shed new light on the physical mechanisms underlying core-collapse supernovae.

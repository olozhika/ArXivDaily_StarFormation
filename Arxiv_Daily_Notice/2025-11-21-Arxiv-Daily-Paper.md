 - **Abstract**
 Temperate ($T_{\rm eq}<400$ K) gas giants represent an unexplored frontier in exoplanet atmospheric spectroscopy. Orbiting a G-type star every ~100 days, the Saturn-mass exoplanet TOI-199 b ($T_{\rm eq}=350$ K) is one of the most favorable low-temperature gas giants for atmospheric study. Here, we present its transmission spectrum from a single transit observed with JWST's NIRSpec G395M mode. Despite lower-than-nominal precision due to a pointing misalignment, Bayesian retrievals reveal the presence of CH$_4$ (Bayes factor of $\sim$700 in a cloudy atmosphere), corresponding to a metallicity of $\rm{C/H}=13^{+78}_{-12}\times$ solar, although the absence of detectable CO and CO$_2$ disfavors metallicities $\gtrsim50\times$ solar. We also tested several haze prescriptions (Titan-like tholin, soot, and water-rich tholin), but the preference for these models is weak (Bayes factors of $\sim 2$ relative to the clear case). The spectrum also shows an increase in transit depth near 3 $\mu$m, which our self-consistent models attribute to either NH$_3$ or, less likely, HCN. Follow-up observations will distinguish between these species, helping determine the planet's vertical mixing regime. The TOI-199 system exhibits strong transit timing variations (TTVs) due to an outer non-transiting giant planet. For planet c, our TTV analysis reduces its mass uncertainty by 50% and prefers a slightly longer orbital period (still within the conservative habitable zone) and higher eccentricity relative to previous studies. TOI-199 b serves as the first data point for studying clouds and hazes in temperate gas giants. The detection of methane supports the emerging trend that temperate low-molecular-weight atmospheres display spectral features in transmission.

 - **Abstract**
 Shock breakout and, in some cases, jet-driven high-energy emission are increasingly recognized as key signatures of the earliest phases of core-collapse supernovae, especially in Type IIn systems due to their dense, interaction-dominated circumstellar environments. We present a comprehensive photometric analysis of SN 2019vxm, a long-duration, luminous Type IIn supernova, $M_V^{}=-21.41\pm0.05\;{\rm mag}$, observed from X-ray to near-infrared. SN 2019vxm is the first superluminous supernovae Type IIn to be caught with well-sampled TESS photometric data on the rise and has a convincing coincident X-ray source at the time of first light. The high-cadence TESS light curve captures the early-time rise, which is well described by a broken power law with an index of $n=1.41\pm0.04$, significantly shallower than the canonical $n=2$ behavior. From this, we constrain the time of first light to within 7.2 hours. We identify a spatial and temporal coincidence between SN 2019vxm and the X-ray transient GRB191117A, corresponding to a $3.3\sigma$ association confidence. Both the short-duration X-ray event and the lightcurve modeling are consistent with shock breakout into a dense, asymmetric circumstellar medium, indicative of a massive, compact progenitor such as a luminous blue variable transitioning to Wolf-Rayet phase embedded in a clumpy, asymmetric environment.

 - **Abstract**
 Magnetic field is the key physical quantity in solar physics as it controls all kinds of solar activity, ranging from nanoflares to big flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs). However, so far only the magnetic field on the solar surface can be more or less precisely measured, and the most important coronal magnetic field remains undetectable accurately. Without the knowledge of the coronal magnetic field, it is even more difficult to obtain secondary quantities related to magnetic field, such as the magnetic helicity and magnetic configuration, including the curvature of field lines. The prevailing approaches to obtain the coronal magnetic field include coronal magnetic extrapolation and coronal seismology. Actually there were scattered efforts to derive secondary magnetic quantities based on imaging observations of solar filaments, without the help of polarization measurements. We call this approach solar filament physiognomy. In this paper, we review these efforts made in the past decades, and point out that this approach will be promising as large telescopes are being built and more fine structures of filament channels will be revealed.

 - **Abstract**
 We present James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) NIRSpec observations of the starless dark cloud Barnard 68 that reveal the spatially-resolved signature of cosmic-ray excited molecular hydrogen (CRXH$_2$) emissions for the first time. Following up on our initial detection of CRXH$_2$ emissions from B68 (Bialy et al. 2025), we now exploit JWST's sensitivity and spatial multiplexing to map CRXH$_2$ rovibrational lines across 16 sight lines through the cloud. By disentangling the CRXH$_2$ and UV-pumped H$_2$ components, we isolate the para-H$_2$-dominated spectrum attributable to cosmic-ray excitation. We find that there are significant spatial variations in the ratio of the CRXH$_2$ line intensity to the line-of-sight H$_2$ column density; these cannot be accounted for by dust extinction alone and demonstrate a clear attenuation of the cosmic-ray flux with increasing shielding column. Modeling B68 as a Bonnor-Ebert sphere, we constrain both the unshielded cosmic-ray ionization rate, $\zeta_{\rm H_2}$, and how it decreases with shielding column. At a reference depth of $N({\rm H}_2) = 3 \times 10^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$, we infer $\zeta_{\rm H_2} \approx 1.4 \times 10^{-16}$ s$^{-1}$, a factor of $\approx 3$ higher than the average value derived from H$_3^+$ absorption studies. These results provide the most direct probe to date of cosmic-ray penetration into cold, dense gas, offering new constraints on both the microphysics of CR-H$_2$ interactions and the attenuation of low-energy cosmic rays in molecular clouds. Our findings establish CRXH$_2$ emission as a powerful new diagnostic of the cosmic-ray environment in interstellar space.

 - **Abstract**
 Gravitational scattering of small bodies (planetesimals) by a planet remains a fundamental problem in celestial mechanics. It is traditionally modeled within the circular restricted three-body problem (CR3BP), where individual particle trajectories are obtained via numerical integrations. Here, we introduce a patched-conic framework to describe the random walk of the orbital energy $x$ for an ensemble of test particles on planet-crossing orbits. We show that the evolution of each particle's orbital elements $(a, e, i)$ is fully encapsulated by the 3D rotation of the relative velocity vector $\mathbf{U}_\infty$, whose magnitude remains constant. Consequently, the system can be reduced to two degrees of freedom. By averaging over all possible flyby geometries, we derive explicit expressions for the drift and diffusion coefficients of $x$. We then solve the resulting Fokker--Planck equation to obtain a closed-form solution for the time evolution of the particle distribution. A characteristic scattering timescale naturally emerges, scaling as $(P_{p}/M_{p}^{2})/500$, where $P_{p}$ is the planet's orbital period and $M_{p}$ its mass ratio to the central star. The typical ejection speed of small bodies by a planet is estimated to be $3 v_p M_{p}^{1/3}$, where $v_p$ is the planet's orbital speed. Our analytical solution constitutes a universal law applicable to both the Solar System and exoplanetary systems, providing a computationally efficient alternative to costly $N$-body simulations for studying the orbital distributions and ejection of planetesimals and planets (e.g., Kuiper Belt, Oort Cloud, debris disks, interstellar objects, and free-floating planets).

 - **Abstract**
 Amorphous silicate dust is a major component in the interstellar and circumstellar dust formed in the outflow of asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars. Although iron depletion is observed in the interstellar medium (ISM), the exact form and fraction of iron in solid remains under debate. In particular, it is unclear whether amorphous silicate dust around AGB stars contains metallic iron. We aimed to provide optical constants of amorphous silicate nanoparticles and examine the effects of metallic iron on their spectral features to better constrain the dust properties by producing amorphous silicate nanoparticles with and without metallic cores. We performed condensation experiments using an induction thermal plasma system to produce dust analogues of the CI chondritic composition in the Mg-Ca-Na-Al-Si-Fe-Ni-O and Mg-Ca-Na-Al-Si-O systems. We measured the absorbance and reflectance of the samples, observed the structure of the products, and determined the optical constants. Two types of amorphous silicate nanoparticles (10-200 nm in diameter) with nearly CI chondritic composition were produced: one contained kamacite (Fe: Ni=0.9: 0.1) cores with a diameter ratio ranging 0-0.87 (average ~0.50), and the other was iron-free homogeneous amorphous silicate. The amorphous silicates of the CI chondritic composition with various sized metallic cores may be prevalent in circumstellar and interstellar dust.

 - **Abstract**
 The recent preference for a dynamical dark energy (DE) from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument seems to call for interactions between DE and dark matter (DM), either from direct DM-DE interaction or indirect interaction induced by modified gravity. Therefore, an independent probe for these kinds of DE-DM interactions would be appealing from observational aspects. In this paper, we propose the black hole superradiance as a novel astrophysical probe for field-theoretic interacting DE-DM models, providing complementary constraints independent of large-scale cosmological observations. The core principle is that the DE-DM interaction can alter the effective mass of the superradiant ultralight boson, thereby modifying its superradiant instability rate around spinning black holes. We explore this connection through two distinct scenarios: a model where the DE field mediates a dark fifth force within the DM sector, affecting the superradiance from DM particles; and a novel mechanism where the DE field itself becomes superradiant due to the effective mass enhancement induced by dense DM spikes around supermassive black holes. By applying a statistical framework to black hole observations in both scenarios, we derive constraints on the fundamental DE-DM coupling strength. Although the current constraints are rather loose due to small samples and inaccurate measurements, our work provides new astrophysical constraints on these interacting DE-DM scenarios and establishes a new synergy between black hole physics and cosmology for probing the fundamental nature of the dark sector.

 - **Abstract**
 The measurement of dust size from millimeter-wavelength spectra provides direct constraints on grain growth in protoplanetary disks. The spectral indices between 0.88 mm and 2.9 mm have been measured in multiple young star-forming regions, such as Taurus, Ophiuchus, and Lupus, which have ages of 1-3 Myr. These spectral indices are as low as 2-3, suggesting that grains in disks are much larger than those in the interstellar medium. In this study, we analyze the ALMA archival data of 23 disks in the Upper Scorpius region. The observed wavelength is 2.9 mm in Band 3, the angular resolution is 3.3 arcsec x 2.1 arcsec, which is not high enough to resolve the targets, and the rms noise is below 0.075 mJy beam$^{-1}$ for almost all sources. Together with the literature values of the Band 7 fluxes of the same targets, we find that the average spectral index of the disks in the Upper Scorpius region is $\alpha_\mathrm{mm}=2.09 \pm 0.10$, which is equal to or slightly smaller than those at the other younger regions. To explain the relationship between the fluxes and spectral indices of the disks in the Taurus, Ophiuchus, Lupus, and Upper Scorpius regions, we construct simple disk evolution models. The observations are best reproduced by models in which the inner radius of the disk increases. This suggests that a substantial amount of dust mass must persist in the outer disk regions where the dust temperature is lower than 20 K even at late evolutionary stages. These findings offer key insights into the grain growth and the temporal evolution of protoplanetary disks.

 - **Abstract**
 Neutrino flavor evolution in dense astrophysical environments is inherently nonlinear and sensitive to many-body (MB) quantum effects beyond the mean-field (MF) approximation. Existing MB studies are constrained by small system sizes, closed boundaries, and highly idealized symmetry assumptions. We present a unified tensor-network framework that enables simulations of inhomogeneous and anisotropic flavor evolution under conditions relevant to core-collapse supernovae and neutron-star mergers. Within this framework, we examine the effects of inhomogeneity, boundary conditions, and convergence with resolution for multiple neutrino distributions, allowing direct comparison of these setups under one consistent formulation. In our simulations, many-body systems equilibrate earlier than their mean-field counterparts while approaching similar final flavor states. Enlarging the interaction region allows open boundaries to reproduce closed-system behavior, but only when the beams begin superimposed and interact continuously. By contrast, initially separated configurations develop entanglement more slowly, interact over longer times, and equilibrate to a flavor content that differs from that obtained from initially superimposed calculations.

 - **Abstract**
 Passively cooling neutron stars (NSs) should reach undetectably low surface temperatures $T_s<10^4$ K in less than $10^7$ yr. However, HST observations have revealed likely thermal UV emission from the Gyr-old millisecond pulsars PSR~J0437$-$4715 and PSR~J2124$-$3358, and from the $\sim10^{7-8}$ yr-old classical pulsars PSR~B0950$+$08 and PSR~J0108$-$1431, implying $T_s\sim10^5$ K and the need for heating mechanisms. We compute the thermal evolution of these NSs including rotochemical heating (RH) in the core with normal or Cooper-paired matter, vortex creep (VC) in the inner crust, and crustal heating through nuclear reactions, and compare the results with observations and with the upper limit for PSR~2144$-$3933. No single mechanism explains all sources. The high temperature of PSR~J0437$-$4715 can be reproduced by RH with a large Cooper pairing gap $\Delta_i\sim1.5$ MeV for either neutrons or protons, but this requires an unrealistically short initial period $P_0\lesssim1.8$ ms to activate the same mechanism in PSR~B0950$+$08. Conversely, the latter can be explained by RH with modified Urca reactions in normal matter or by VC with an excess angular momentum $J\sim3\times10^{43}$ erg,s, but these models underpredict PSR~J0437$-$4715. A model combining RH with a large pairing gap and VC matches both pulsars and is consistent with the upper limits for the remaining three. It further predicts that their temperatures should lie close to these limits, suggesting that deeper or broader-wavelength observations would provide a strong test of this scenario.
#### Disc fragmentation. I. Ejection of Jupiter-mass Free Floating Planets from growing binary systems

 - **Abstract**
 Over the past 25 years, observations have uncovered a large population of free-floating planets (FFPs), whose origins remain debated. Massive FFPs (several Jupiter masses or more) may form via gravitational collapse of molecular clouds, similar to stars. Lower-mass FFPs likely originate in planetary systems and are later ejected through dynamical interactions. We show that disc fragmentation in very young stellar binaries may be an abundant source of Jupiter-like FFPs (JFFPs), with masses above 0.3 Jupiter masses. In our model, disc fragmentation at tens to 100 au from the primary star produces gas giants, while fragmentation further out forms a more massive object that will eventually evolve into the secondary star. We present 3D simulations of massive, self-gravitating discs with embedded Jupiter-mass planets and a secondary seed ($5-50 M_J$). Chaotic migration leads to frequent planet-secondary interactions, imparting velocity kicks via gravitational slingshot that usually end in planet ejection. The ejection fraction increases steeply with the secondary-to-primary mass ratio, $q_s$, reaching 0.6 for $q_s > 0.05$. Compared to Core Accretion JFFPs, disc fragmentation JFFPs: (i) form earlier, and may be more abundant in young clusters; (ii) are ejected at much lower velocities; (iii) may retain compact circum-planetary discs. To reproduce the observed abundance of JFFPs, disc fragmentation planets must be in the post-collapse configuration. They must also either form more frequently in binary systems than around single stars, or be frequently disrupted in inner disc regions, as previously suggested in certain versions of the theory.
#### A Core-Collapse Supernova Neutrino Parameterization with Enhanced Physical Interpretability

 - **Abstract**
 We introduce a novel parameterization of supernova neutrino energy spectra with a clear physical motivation. Its central parameter, $\tau(t)$, quantifies the characteristic thermal-diffusion area during the explosion. When applied to the historic SN1987A data, this parameterization yields statistically significant fits and provides robust constraints on the unobserved low-energy portion of the spectrum. Beyond this specific application, we demonstrate the model's power on a suite of 3D core-collapse supernova simulations, finding that the temporal evolution of $\tau(t)$ distinctly separates successful from failed explosions. Furthermore, we constrain the progenitor mass of SN 1987A to approximately 19 solar masses by applying Smoothed Isotonic Regression, while noting the sensitivity of this estimate to observational uncertainties. Moreover, in these simulations, $\tau(t)$ and the gravitational-wave strain amplitude display a strong, synergistic co-evolution, directly linking the engine's energetic evolution to its geometric asymmetry. This implies that the thermodynamic state of the explosion is imprinted not only on the escaping neutrino flux, but also recorded in the shape of the energy spectrum. Our framework therefore offers a valuable tool for decoding the detailed core dynamics and multi-messenger processes of future galactic supernovae.

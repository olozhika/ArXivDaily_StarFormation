 - **Abstract**
 We present a comprehensive photometric and kinematic study of the open clusters HSC 25, HSC 37, and HSC 2878, located in the innermost regions of the Galactic disc. Utilizing data from Gaia DR3 and the UPMASK membership algorithm, we identify 44, 55, and 112 most probable members for HSC 25, HSC 37, and HSC 2878, respectively. The mean proper-motion components are obtained as (-5.901 +/- 0.41, -6.213 +/- 0.40), (-3.231 +/- 0.56, -4.564 +/- 0.47), and (-3.830 +/- 0.51, -5.198 +/- 0.44) mas yr^-1 for HSC 25, HSC 37, and HSC 2878, respectively. The open clusters span a broad range of evolutionary stages, with estimated ages of log(t/yr) = 8.38 +/- 0.08, 7.04 +/- 0.09, and 9.04 +/- 0.09, and corresponding heliocentric distances of 7.36 +/- 0.37, 6.79 +/- 0.18, and 6.17 +/- 0.22 kpc. The obtained metallicities are 0.0388 +/- 0.0039, 0.0259 +/- 0.0028, and 0.0209 +/- 0.0023, respectively. Total mass estimates are 135, 755, and 204 solar masses, respectively, highlighting notable differences in stellar content across the clusters. An analysis of dynamical relaxation times suggests that HSC 25 and HSC 2878 are dynamically evolved, whereas the much younger HSC 37 is still in an early phase of dynamical evolution. The high space velocities and orbital parameters of these clusters reveal significant deviations from typical disc kinematics. HSC 25 and HSC 37 exhibit eccentric orbits and small perigalactic distances, consistent with dynamically heated or accreted origins within the Galactic bulge. In contrast, HSC 2878's relaxed, planar orbit suggests in situ bulge membership despite its age. These findings point toward a heterogeneous dynamical origin for the clusters, with implications for star formation and evolution in the inner Milky Way.

 - **Abstract**
 Long baseline optical and infrared interferometric arrays achieve high angular resolution and enable detailed astrophysical measurements. Interferometers have enabled observations of stars at various stages of evolution, as well as studies of binary stars, circumstellar disks, and active galactic nuclei. The CHARA Array is a long-baseline interferometric array at the Mount Wilson Observatory, USA. At the core of CHARA operations are the delay lines, which equalize the optical path length for all telescopes as the Earth rotates and compensate for optical path variations induced by atmospheric turbulence. We report recent upgrades and performance of the CHARA Array optical delay lines for high-precision interferometric observations. The legacy system had been operational for over two decades, and it was increasingly difficult to acquire replacement parts. Beginning in mid-2021, the control system underwent a major upgrade, replacing the aging VME-based architecture with a modern hybrid FPGA and Linux-based system; this modernization continued through the end of 2024. We describe hardware/software changes, the servo architecture, and lab/on-sky performance. The upgraded system achieves residual delay line cart tracking errors of $\sim12$~nm, the same level as the legacy system, and a control bandwidth of 100-130~Hz, allowing fringe tracking across the R, H, and K bands. Initial commissioning revealed key issues such as metrology time-tick jitter and vibration-induced visibility loss, which were diagnosed and resolved. We note ongoing and future efforts to extend baselines up to 1~km and support advanced observing modes such as dual-field interferometry and nulling. This paper is a reference for current and future use of the CHARA Array and for next-generation instrument design.
#### Direct contact binary planetesimal formation from gravitational collapse

 - **Abstract**
 Bilobate contact binaries comprise a significant fraction of the relict Kuiper Belt, which includes the exemplary contact binary (486958) Arrokoth. The surfaces of its lobes contain similar amounts of highly volatile chemical species and few craters, indicating formation in a homogeneous and gentle environment. Arrokoth's bilobate shape was initially hypothesized to have formed via the direct gravitational collapse of a pebble cloud in the solar system's protoplanetary disk. However, alternative hypotheses have proposed that Arrokoth may be the result of binary planetesimal formation and the subsequent dynamical evolution of the binary components into contact through external perturbations over long timescales. Here, we show that contact binary planetesimals like Arrokoth can form directly from the gravitational collapse of pebble clouds. We used a soft-sphere discrete element method (SSDEM) to discover that planetesimals form a wide variety of shapes, including bilobate contact binaries. This method creates planetesimals as particle-aggregates with particles resting upon each other's surfaces via mutual surface penetration. The formation of contact binaries in our simulations strengthens the hypothesis that Arrokoth, and perhaps many other contact binaries in the Kuiper Belt, formed directly as bilobate objects from gravitational collapse, and so their shapes and surfaces record the era of planet formation.

 - **Abstract**
 The nature of dark matter and dark energy are among the central questions in cosmology. Strong gravitational lenses with multiple source planes provide a geometric probe of cosmology: the ratio of deflection angles at different redshifts depends only on angular-diameter distances, constraining the matter density $\Omega_m$ and the dark energy equation of state $w$. However, constraints from this technique have historically lagged behind those from the CMB, SNe Ia, and BAO. In this work, we present new cosmological constraints from the Carousel Lens, a cluster-scale lens with more than 40 extended images from 11 spectroscopically confirmed sources. Its relaxed core and rich set of extended images behind the main halo make it particularly suitable for cosmological inference. Using the GIGA-Lens pipeline, we construct a pixel-level lens model including six HST-detected sources and four mass components. From this model, we obtain $w$CDM constraints of $\Omega_m = 0.34^{+0.16}_{-0.13}$ and $w = -1.31^{+0.35}_{-0.32}$ from the Carousel Lens alone, accounting for both statistical and systematic uncertainties. We further project that including four additional known higher-redshift sources, assuming similar fractional uncertainties, could improve the constraining power by ~80%, bringing the precision close to that of the CMB and SNe Ia. For an evolving dark energy model ($w_0w_a$CDM), the Carousel Lens alone yields constraints comparable to the CMB, providing an independent and complementary probe alongside SN Ia and BAO. While currently systematic uncertainties dominate, which we quantify through simulations, our results demonstrate that relaxed multi-source-plane cluster lenses can deliver competitive cosmological constraints. Further improvements are expected from reductions in systematics and from incorporating higher-redshift sources (known and new) with high-resolution imaging.

 - **Abstract**
 The first stars likely formed from pristine clouds, marking a transformative epoch after the dark ages by initiating reionisation and synthesising the first heavy elements. Among these, low-mass Population III stars are of particular interest, as their long lifespans raise the possibility that some may survive to the present day in the Milky Way's stellar halo or satellite dwarfs. As the first paper in a series, we present hydrodynamic evolutionary models for 0.7 - 1 MSun stars evolved up to the white dwarf phase, utilising the MESA software instrument. We systematically vary mass-loss efficiencies, convective transport, and overshooting prescriptions, thereby mapping how uncertain physics influences nucleosynthetic yields; surface enrichment, including nitrogen-rich post-main sequence stars arising from convective shell mergers; remnant properties, such as low-mass helium or carbon-oxygen white dwarfs (M_WD ~ 0.45-0.55 MSun) and transient UV-bright phases; and potential observational signatures, including neutrino emission during shell mergers and helium flashes. These models establish a predictive framework for identifying surviving Pop III stars and their descendants, providing both evolutionary and observational constraints that were previously unexplored.

 - **Abstract**
 This paper re-evaluates the relationship between the observed sunward electron cutoff energy and the depth of the Sun's global electrostatic potential. It investigates whether taking into account the effects of local traps formed by magnetic fluctuations provides an alternative explanation for the observed electron deficit. The fluctuations of the highly variable interplanetary magnetic field form a series of shallow magnetic mirror traps that move at approximately the speed of the solar wind. The study investigates the dynamics of electrons as they move outward against an attractive solar electrostatic potential and interact with these traps. By following the motion of the electrons using first-principles calculations, we assess the effect of the traps on the velocity distribution of the particles. Electrons that escape the local trap continue to lose energy as they move outward until they are eventually captured by subsequent traps, preventing them from returning to the observer as sunward-moving particles. We derive a mathematical expression for the cutoff velocity, defined as the limit beyond which particles can no longer overtake the outer endpoint of a local trap. It turns out that the observed cutoff energy characterizes only the local potential drop within a trap, rather than the total depth of the Sun's potential well. The true potential well can be significantly deeper, scaled by the ratio of the radial distance from the Sun to the trap size. Furthermore, electrons captured by these moving traps contribute to the formation of the solar wind core population. The Sun's electrostatic potential is a more significant factor in solar wind acceleration than previously interpreted from cutoff data. The interaction between electrostatic deceleration and moving magnetic traps provides a new framework for understanding the origin and behavior of the solar wind core electrons.

 - **Abstract**
 We analyze an XRISM/Resolve observation of NGC1068, focusing on the Fe K$\alpha$ and Fe K$\beta$ fluorescent lines and on the Fe XXV and Fe XXVI emission complexes. Line centroid energies, intrinsic widths, flux ratios, and constraints on the Compton shoulder are derived through local spectral fitting, and compared with atomic calculations and theoretical predictions. The centroid energies of the Fe K$\alpha$ and Fe K$\beta$ lines tightly constrain the emitting material to be neutral or near-neutral. The observed Fe K$\beta$/K$\alpha$ ratio, together with the stringent upper limit on the Compton shoulder ($\lesssim$8--11% of the core flux), disfavour reflection dominated by a homogeneous, classical Compton-thick medium, indicating that most of the neutral Fe K$\alpha$ emission arises in optically thin or moderately Compton-thick gas. The Fe XXV and Fe XXVI emission lines exhibit remarkably large velocity widths, of several thousand km~s$^{-1}$. These broad profiles closely resemble the integrated optical and infrared [O III] and [O IV] lines associated with the large-scale biconical outflow, and are naturally interpreted as the X-ray signature of a more highly ionized, faster, and more spatially confined phase of the same outflow. The iron-K emission of NGC1068 reveals a stratified circumnuclear environment in which neutral and highly ionized components arise in physically distinct regions. The neutral Fe K fluorescence originates predominantly in optically thin or mildly Compton-thick material, despite the persistently Compton-thick line-of-sight obscuration, indicating a geometrically complex cold reprocessor. The highly ionized iron emission lines trace a fast component consistent with a warm bipolar outflow on parsec scales, whose large velocities and inferred energetics suggest that it may represent an efficient channel for feedback in a heavily obscured Seyfert galaxy.
#### Resolving the Multiple Component Outflows in PG 1211+143: II. The Soft X-ray View of the Ultra Fast Outflow

 - **Abstract**
 The nearby quasar, PG 1211+143, has one of the prototype examples of an ultra fast outflow (UFO), as seen in several past XMM-Newton and Chandra observations. In December 2024, PG 1211+143 was observed simultaneously with XRISM Resolve and XMM-Newton, allowing both the Fe K and soft X-ray outflows to be examined at high resolution simultaneously. The Resolve spectrum revealed a forest of Fe K band absorption lines from the UFO (Mizumoto et al. 2026), comprising of up to six discrete velocity components ranging from $v/c=-0.074$ to $v/c=-0.40$. Here we present the simultaneous XMM-Newton RGS (Reflection Grating Spectrometer) spectrum, where three lower ionization counterparts of the Fe K velocity zones are observed; at $v/c=-0.074, -0.12$ and $-0.33$. The soft X-ray absorbers tend to be somewhat less ionized than their Fe K counterparts, with their opacity mainly arising from Fe L shell lines and highly ionized Oxygen. From comparing the Resolve and RGS absorbers, we show that the outflow can be parameterized with a density profile varying with radius as $r^{-5/3}$, while the lower ionization zones likely originate from denser clumps of gas. Pure electron scattering appears insufficient to provide enough thrust to power the wind, unless sufficient low ionization gas capable of radiative line driving exists outside of the line of sight. Overall, PG 1211+143 provides further evidence for the clumpy nature of accretion disk winds, as was recently revealed in the quasar PDS 456 with XRISM.

 - **Abstract**
 Polarized emission from interstellar dust grains is commonly used to infer information about the underlying magnetic field from the diffuse interstellar medium to molecular cloud cores. Therefore, the ability to accurately determine properties of the magnetic field requires a thorough understanding of the dust alignment mechanism. We investigate the influence of anisotropic radiation fields on the alignment of dust particles by magnetic fields, known as radiative torque (RAT) alignment. Specifically, we take advantage of the unique spatial configuration of the molecular cloud core L43, which contains an embedded yet optically visible star acting as a local source of anisotropic illumination. Based on polarization maps obtained at wavelengths of $154 \mu\mathrm{m}$ (SOFIA/HAWC+), as well as $450 \mu\mathrm{m}$ and $850 \mu\mathrm{m}$ (JCMT/SCUBA-2), which show variations in the degree and angle of polarized emission across all wavelengths, we applied the differential measure analysis method to infer magnetic field strengths and analyze the global polarization spectrum of this source. We derived plane-of-sky magnetic field strengths ranging from approximately 13 to 60 $\mu\mathrm{G}$, varying with wavelength, and find a negative slope of the polarization spectrum. Compared to 3D radiative transfer simulations, this finding can be attributed, at least partially, to variations in dust properties and temperatures along the line of sight. However, the additional influence of variations in the magnetic field orientation along the line of sight cannot be ruled out. Our results favor radiative torques as the primary alignment mechanism, as they indicate that the degree of polarization is dependent on temperature and hence the strength of the local radiation field.

 - **Abstract**
 Massive O-type stars lose a significant fraction of their mass through radiation-driven winds, a process that critically shapes their evolution and feedback into the interstellar medium. Accurate predictions of mass-loss rates are essential for models of stellar structure and population synthesis. We computed wind parameters for O-type stars using a self-consistent approach that couples the hydrodynamics of the wind with detailed calculations of the line acceleration. This approach follows the theory of radiation-driven stellar winds and allows us to derive mass-loss rate distributions for different atomic configurations of the stellar flux. We used the TLUSTY code for stellar atmosphere models to compute non-local thermodynamic equilibrium models; these models served as input radiation fields for the calculation of the line-force parameters, for which we used the LOCUS code. These line-force parameters were then iteratively coupled with the HYDWIND code to solve the wind hydrodynamics. The procedure was applied across a grid of stellar parameters for three chemical configurations. We obtain self-consistent wind parameters for a broad set of O-type stellar models. The results show a systematic decrease in mass-loss rates with the inclusion of more elements in the radiation field, which is attributed to a strong effect on the UV region of the spectral energy distribution. As more elements are included, resulting in a larger number of spectral lines, the contribution from the UV diminishes, leading to lower mass-loss rates. We fitted three theoretical prescriptions for $\dot{M}$ using a Bayesian approach; this yielded Pearson correlation values greater than 0.92 for all three model grids. It also allowed for the estimation of the wind momentum-luminosity relationships for each of the grids, yielding results similar to those based on observations of O-type stars.

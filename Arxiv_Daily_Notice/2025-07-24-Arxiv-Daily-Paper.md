 - **Abstract**
 The X-SHYNE library is a homogeneous sample of 43 medium-resolution (R=8000) infrared (0.3-2.5um) spectra of young (<500Myr), low-mass (<20Mjup), and cold (Teff=600-2000K) isolated brown dwarfs and wide-separation companions observed with the VLT/X-Shooter instrument. To characterize our targets, we performed a global comparative analysis. We first applied a semi-empirical approach. By refining their age and bolometric luminosity, we derived key atmospheric and physical properties, such as Teff, mass, surface gravity (g), and radius, using the evolutionary model COND03. These results were then compared with the results from a synthetic analysis based on three self-consistent atmospheric models. To compare our spectra with these grids we used the Bayesian inference code ForMoSA. We found similar Lbol estimates between both approaches, but an underestimated Teff from the cloudy models, likely due to a lack of absorbers that could dominate the J and H bands of early L. We also observed a discrepancy in the log(g) estimates, which are dispersed between 3.5 and 5.5 dex for mid-L objects. We interpreted this as a bias caused by a range of rotational velocities leading to cloud migration toward equatorial latitudes, combined with a variety of viewing angles that result in different observed atmospheric properties (cloud column densities, atmospheric pressures, etc.). Finally, while providing robust estimates of [M/H] and C/O for individual objects remains challenging, the X-SHYNE library globally suggests solar values, which are consistent with a formation via stellar formation mechanisms. This study highlights the strength of homogeneous datasets in performing comparative analyses, reducing the impact of systematics, and ensuring robust conclusions while avoiding over-interpretation.
#### Variable X-ray reverberation in the rapidly accreting AGN Ark 564: the response of the soft excess to the changing geometry of the inner accretion flow

 - **Abstract**
 X-ray reverberation, which exploits the time delays between variability in different energy bands as a function of Fourier frequency, probes the structure of the inner accretion disks and X-ray coronae of active galactic nuclei. We present a systematic X-ray spectroscopic and reverberation study of the high-Eddington-ratio narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxy Ark 564, using over 900 ks of \textit{XMM-Newton} and \textit{NuSTAR} observations spanning 13 years. The time-averaged spectra can be well described by the a model consisting of a coronal continuum, relativistic disk reflection, warm Comptonization, and three warm absorbers. Leveraging the high X-ray brightness of Ark 564, we are able to resolve the time evolution of the spectra and contemporaneous reverberation lags. The soft-band lag relative to the continuum increases with the X-ray flux, while Fe K$\alpha$ lags are detected in only a subset of epochs and do not correlate with soft lags. Models based on a lamppost corona and reflection from a standard thin disk can broadly reproduce the observed lag-energy spectra of low-flux epochs; however, additional reverberation from the warm Comptonized atmosphere is required to explain the soft lags observed in high-flux epochs. A vertically puffed-up inner disk and a variable, vertically extended corona can better explain the observed evolution of the lags and covariance spectra. Our study underscores the importance of multi-epoch, multi-band analyses for a comprehensive understanding the inner accretion disk and corona.

 - **Abstract**
 Gravitational waves emitted from core-collapse supernova explosions are critical observables for extracting information about the dynamics and properties of both the progenitor and the post-bounce~evolution of the system. They are prime targets for current interferometric searches and represent a key milestone for the capabilities of next-generation interferometers. This study aims to characterize how the gravitational waveform associated with prompt stellar convection depends on the rotational rate and magnetic field topology of the progenitor star. We carry out a series of axisymmetric simulations of a $16.5\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$ red supergiant with five configurations of initial magnetic fields and varying degrees of initial rotation. We then analyze the contribution of early-time convection and the proto-neutron star core to the waveform using ensemble empirical mode decomposition, alongside spectral and Fourier analyses, to facilitate comparison and interpretation of the results. Our simulations reveal that early post-bounce gravitational waves signals are dominated by the first six intrinsic mode functions, with variations due to rotation and magnetic fields influencing the signal strength. Strong magnetic fields decelerate core rotation, affecting mode excitation. Regardless of the initial rotation, convection consistently drives a low-frequency mode that lasts throughout the evolution. Additionally, our results show that the bounce signal is not consistently the strongest component of the waveform. Instead, we find that prompt convection generates a post-bounce signal of comparable or even greater amplitude.

 - **Abstract**
 The source of extragalactic neutrinos in the TeV-PeV range is a matter of very active research, with blazar jets having been postulated to be the origin of at least some of the detections. The blazar PKS 0735+178 is a prominent example; during its multi-band flare in late 2021 a neutrino event was reported by four observatories, with its origin consistent with the direction of that source. While no new jet component was observed to be ejected during that narrow time-frame, our analysis shows that a propagating shock front originating from the core region was the likely source of the multi-band flare, using very-long-baseline interferometry images of PKS 0735+178 in polarised light. Taken together, our findings are suggestive of a coherent scenario in which the shock may contribute to the acceleration of protons, with the target photons potentially originating either from the ambient medium surrounding the jet or from proton synchrotron radiation. The necessary conditions for neutrino emission via proton-photon interactions are, hence, present in this jet.

 - **Abstract**
 Traditional N-body methods introduce localised perturbations in the gravitational forces governing their evolution. These perturbations lead to an artificial fragmentation in the filamentary network of the Large Scale Structure, often referred to as "beads-on-a-string." This issue is particularly apparent in cosmologies with a suppression of the matter power spectrum at small spatial scales, such as warm dark matter models, where the perturbations induced by the N-body discretisation dominate the cosmological power at the suppressed scales. Initial conditions based on third-order Lagrangian perturbation theory, which allow for a late-starting redshift, have been shown to minimise numerical errors contributing to such artefacts. In this work, we investigate whether the additional use of a spatially adaptive softening for dark matter particles, based on the gravitational tidal field, can reduce the severity of artificial fragmentation. Tidal adaptive softening significantly improves force accuracy in idealised filamentary collapse simulations over a fixed softening approach. However, it does not substantially reduce spurious haloes in cosmological simulations when paired with such optimised initial conditions. Nevertheless, tidal adaptive softening induces a shift in halo formation times in warm dark matter simulations compared to a fixed softening counterpart, an effect not seen in cold dark matter simulations. Furthermore, initialising the initial conditions at an earlier redshift generally results in z=0 haloes forming from Lagrangian volumes with lower average sphericity. This sphericity difference could impact post-processing algorithms identifying spurious objects based on Lagrangian volume morphology. We propose potential strategies for reducing spurious haloes without abandoning current N-body methods.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Astrochemical modeling requires, as input, the effective column density of gas (or extinction) that attenuates an external, isotropic, far-ultraviolet radiation field. In three-dimensional simulations, this can be calculated through ray-tracing schemes, while in 0D chemical models it is often treated as a free parameter. Aims. We aim to produce an analytic, physically motivated formalism to predict the average relationship between the effective hydrogen-nuclei column density, $N_{\rm eff}({\rm H})$, and the local hydrogen-nuclei number density, $n_{\rm H}$. Methods. We construct an analytic model utilizing characteristic length scales that connects the turbulence-dominated regime and the gravitational-dominated regime at high-density. Results. The model well-reproduces a previous analytic fit to simulation results and is consistent with the high-density power-law indices, e.g., $N_{\rm eff}(H) \propto n^{\gamma}$, of $\gamma \approx 0.4 - 0.5$ found in previous numerical simulations utilizing ray-tracing. Conclusions. We present an analytic model relating the average effective column density, $N_{\rm eff}$, to the local number density, $n_{\rm H}$, which reproduces the behaviors found in three-dimensional simulations. The analytic model can be utilized as a sub-grid prescription for shielded molecular gas or in astrochemical models for a physically motivated estimation of the attenuating column density.

 - **Abstract**
 Measuring properties of young stellar objects (YSOs) is necessary for probing the pre-main-sequence evolution of stars. As YSOs exhibit complex geometry, measurement generally entails comparing observed radiation to template populations of radiative-transfer model YSO spectral energy distributions (SEDs). Due to uncertainty on the precise mechanics of star formation, the properties inferred for YSOs using these models often depend strongly on the assumed accretion history. We develop a framework for predicting observable properties of YSOs that is agnostic to the underlying accretion history, enabling comparison between theories. This framework links a set of radiative-transfer SEDs with protostellar evolutionary tracks to create models of evolving YSOs. Unlike previous works, we directly relate evolution models to observables through theoretical physical parameters rather than through intermediate, observationally derived analogues. We make flux predictions for YSOs corresponding to stars with birth masses from 0.2 to 50 $M_\odot$ during their accretion phase following isothermal-sphere, turbulent-core, and competitive accretion histories, showing that these histories may be observationally distinguished by examining the 100-$\mu$m and 3-mm fluxes of a YSO. We discuss the impact of dust models and parameter ranges on the output of radiative transfer simulations through a comparison to another SED model grid. We quantify the degree of confusion between YSO Stages and Classes across a wide range of physical scenarios; for each, we calculate confusion matrices that enable inference of the number of objects of a given Stage from an observed population. Finally, we critically examine the physical significance of various literature Stage and Class definitions.

 - **Abstract**
 Observations of the lunar exosphere provide valuable insights into dynamic processes affecting the Moon, such as meteoroid bombardment. The Chamberlain model was employed to estimate the zenith column density and temperature of Na atoms on August 13/14, 2009, after the peak of the Perseid meteor shower. Additionally, the column density and temperature of Na atoms delivered to the lunar exosphere by gradual processes during the peak on August 12/13, 2009, were estimated. Expected ratios of line-of-sight column densities of Na atoms at three observed altitudes on August 12/13, 2009, were obtained using the Chamberlain model and Monte Carlo simulations. The heightened intensities of Na emission lines on August 12/13, 2009, are attributed to the onset of the third short-term peak in Perseid activity predicted by celestial mechanics. The best agreement between observations and theoretical models was achieved with a theoretical temperature of 3000 K for impact-produced Na atoms. This third peak of Perseids began between 23:29 and 23:41 UT on August 12, 2009, lasting approximately 83 minutes, with a mass flux attributed to the Perseids ranging between 1.6 x 10^-16 and 5 x 10^-16 g cm^-2 s^-1. Additionally, depletion of Li content compared to Na content in the lunar exosphere was detected. A model predicting Perseid meteoroid stream activity on the Moon was developed and compared with spectral observations of the lunar exosphere. By modeling 25,000 years of comet 109P/Swift-Tuttle's orbits, 175 cometary trails likely to have generated meteoroids near Earth and the Moon during the Perseid 2009 meteor shower were identified. Our results reveal annual maxima inducing filament trail structures, one of which closely aligned with the observed peak of increased Na content in the lunar exosphere.

 - **Abstract**
 The thermodynamics of interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs) is often described using a polytropic process. Estimating the polytopic index ($\gamma$) allows us to quantify the expansion or compression of the ICME plasma arising from changes in the plasma temperature. In this study, we estimate $\gamma$ for protons inside the magnetic clouds (MCs), their associated sheaths, and ambient solar wind for a large sample of well-observed events observed by the Wind spacecraft at 1 AU. We find that $\gamma$ shows a high ($\approx 1.6$) - low ($\approx 1.05$) - high ($\approx 1.2$) behavior inside the ambient solar wind, sheath, and MCs, respectively. We also find that the proton polytropic index is independent of small-scale density fluctuations. Furthermore, our results show that the stored energy inside MC plasma is not expended in expanding its cross-section at 1 AU. The sub-adiabatic nature of MC plasma implies external heating - possibly due to thermal conduction from the corona. We find that the heating gradient per unit mass from the corona to the protons of MC at 1 AU is $\approx 0.21$ erg cm$^{-1}$ g$^{-1}$ which is in agreement with the required proton heating budget.

 - **Abstract**
 We introduce a new photometric mapping method for the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) to measure the spatial distribution of carbonaceous dust, siliceous dust and water ice by using absorption features arising from the grains in the dense interstellar medium (ISM). Employing NIRCam and MIRI imaging filters, low-resolution spectroscopic data can be obtained to measure the optical depths of the 3.0-$\mu$m water ice -OH feature, the 3.4-$\mu$m aliphatic hydrocarbon -CH feature, and the 10-$\mu$m silicate -SiO feature for large fields of view. This method provides extensive statistical data of the grains across wide fields in the ISM at minimal observing cost. In this study, we present its application on observational data from the literature to validate the measured optical depths and simulations to assess the accuracy of the method under various conditions. We showed that the photometric method can be employed to obtain reasonably accurate measurements of optical depth. We demonstrate that JWST optical depth maps enable the independent exploration of abundance distributions of major grain components across a wide spatial coverage in the ISM.

 - **Abstract**
 Grain-surface chemistry plays a crucial role in the formation of molecules of astrobiological interest, including H$_{2}$S and complex organic molecules (COMs). They are commonly observed in the gas phase toward star-forming regions, but their detection in ices remains limited. Combining gas-phase observations with chemical modeling is therefore essential for advancing our understanding of their chemistry. In this paper we investigate the factors that promote or hinder molecular complexity combining gas-phase observations of CH$_{3}$OH, H$_{2}$S, OCS, N$_{2}$H$^{+}$, and C$^{18}$O with chemical modeling in two dense cores: Barnard-1b and IC348. We observed millimeter emission lines of CH$_{3}$OH, H$_{2}$S, OCS, N$_{2}$H$^{+}$, and C$^{18}$O along strips using the IRAM 30m and Yebes 40m telescopes. We used the gas-grain chemical model \texttt{Nautilus} to reproduce the observed abundance profiles adjusting parameters such as initial sulfur abundances and binding energies. H$_{2}$S, N$_{2}$H$^{+}$ and C$^{18}$O gas-phase abundances vary up to one order of magnitude towards the extinction peak. CH$_{3}$OH abundance remains quite uniform. These abundances can only be reproduced assuming a decreasing sulfur budget, which lowers H$_{2}$S and enhances CH$_{3}$OH abundances. Decreasing binding energies, which are expected in CO-rich apolar ices, are also required. The sulfur depletion required by H$_2$S is generally higher than that required by CH$_3$OH, suggesting unknown sulfur sinks. These findings highlight the intricate relationship between sulfur chemistry and COM formation, driven by the competition between sulfur and CO for hydrogen atoms. Our study emphasizes that the growth of CO ice and the progressive sequestration of hydrogen atoms by sulfur are critical in determining whether chemical complexity can develop, providing key insights into the early stages of star and planet formation.

 - **Abstract**
 Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration transient events that are typically observed at radio wavelengths and cosmological distances but their origin remains unclear. Furthermore, most FRB origin models are related to the processes at stellar scales, involving neutron stars, blackholes, supernovae, etc. In this paper, our purpose is to determine whether multi-structural one-off FRBs and repeaters share similarities. To achieve this, we focus on analyzing the relationship between the FRB event rate and the star formation rate, complemented by statistical testing methods. Based on the CHIME/FRB Catalog 1, we calculate the energy functions for four subsamples, including apparent non-repeating FRBs (one-offs), repeaters, multi-structural one-offs, and the joint repeaters and multi-structural events, respectively. We then derive the FRB event rates at different redshifts for all four subsamples, all of which were found to share a similar cosmological evolution trend. However, we find that the multi-structural one-offs and repeaters are distinguishable from the KS and MWW tests.

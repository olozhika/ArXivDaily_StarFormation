 - **Abstract**
 Multiwavelength observations, from radio to X-rays, have revealed the presence of multiphase high-velocity gas near the center of the Milky Way likely associated with powerful galactic outflows. This region offers a unique laboratory to study the physics of feedback and the nature of multiphase winds in detail. To this end, we have developed physically motivated semi-analytical models of a multiphase outflow consisting of a hot gas phase ($T \gg 10^6$ K) that embeds colder clouds ($T \sim 5000$ K). Our models include the gravitational potential of the Milky Way; the drag force exerted by the hot phase onto the cold clouds; and the exchange of mass, momentum, and energy between gas phases. Using Bayesian inference, we compared the predictions of our models with observations of a population of HI high-velocity clouds detected up to $\sim$1.5 kpc above the Galactic plane near the Galactic center. We find that a class of supernova-driven winds launched by star formation in the central molecular zone can successfully reproduce the observed velocities, spatial distribution, and masses of the clouds. In our two-phase models, the mass and energy loading factors of both phases are consistent with recent theoretical expectations. The cold clouds are accelerated by the hot wind via ram pressure drag and via accretion of high-velocity material, resulting from the turbulent mixing and subsequent cooling. However, this interaction also leads to gradual cloud disruption, with smaller clouds losing over 70\% of their initial mass by the time they reach $\sim$2 kpc.

 - **Abstract**
 The density distribution within molecular clouds offers critical insights into their underlying physical processes, which are essential for understanding star formation. As a statistical measure of column density on the cloud scale, the shape and evolution of the column density probability density function (N-PDF) serve as important tools for understanding the dynamics between turbulence and gravity. Here we investigate the N-PDFs of Cygnus-X using the column density map obtained from Herschel, supplemented by HI and Young Stellar Objects (YSO) data. We find that the N-PDFs of Cygnus-X and four sub-regions display log-normal + power-law shapes, indicating the combined effects of turbulence and gravity in sculpting the density structure. We find evidence that the power-law segment of the N-PDFs flattens over time, and the transitional column density can be seen as a unique and stable star formation threshold specific to each molecular cloud. These results not only clarify the physical state of Cygnus-X but also emphasize the utility of the N-PDF as a statistical diagnostic tool, as it is an accessible indicator of evolutionary stages and star formation thresholds in molecular clouds.
#### The Cosmic-ray Knee as a Local Signature of Nearby PeVatrons

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.05435

 - **Abstract**
 A "knee" in the cosmic-ray spectrum, characterized by a sudden steepening of the spectral shape at $\sim 4$ PeV, may be interpreted either as a global feature of Galactic cosmic rays or as a local signature. In the former scenario, cosmic-ray spectra throughout the Galaxy would be similar to that observed in the solar neighborhood, and the knee would be a common feature of the cosmic-ray sea. In the latter scenario, the PeV cosmic-ray flux varies across the Galactic disk, and the knee is dominantly contributed by a small number of nearby sources. By simulating cosmic-ray propagation in the Galactic magnetic field and interstellar medium, we show that the two scenarios correspond to different regimes of the birth rate of PeV proton accelerators and depend on the presence of powerful nearby sources. By comparison with both cosmic-ray and gamma-ray observations, we find that a local knee would be best explained by sources located at distances of order $\sim1$ kpc and with ages in the range 0.1-1 Myr, with the Cygnus Cocoon being a particularly promising candidate.

 - **Abstract**
 The Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) contains a substantial reservoir of dense molecular gas, where numerous young stellar objects (YSOs) and dense cloud cores have been identified. However, the large distance and severe foreground extinction complicate interpretation of infrared ice absorption features tracing chemical and evolutionary properties of these embedded objects. To better characterise YSOs and dense cores in this region, we combined spectra from multiple YSOs, each likely backlit by a giant star, allowing us to probe their outer layers and derive an ensemble-averaged ice abundance profile. We obtained L-band spectra of 15 point-like sources with extremely red colours using Gemini/GNIRS, enabling measurements of the CH3OH absorption feature at 3.535 micron. To better constrain the foreground extinction and H$_2$O ice column densities, we combined these data with K-band and mid-infrared spectra using NASA/IRTF and Spitzer/IRS. We found that the CH$_3$OH abundance in the CH$_3$OH-CO$_2$ ice mixture is 2 to 5 percent, confirming that it is systematically lower than those typically observed in the Galactic disk. Furthermore, by using the local excess of foreground extinction as a proxy for the projected distance between a backlit source and the centre of a YSO, we found that the CH$_3$OH abundance relative to solid CO$_2$ remains near 10 percent in the inner regions of the envelope, but increases sharply to about 30 percent in the outer regions. The relatively low methanol ice abundance may reflect the unique chemical environment of the CMZ. However, our results offer an alternative interpretation: since our sample is biased towards massive and luminous YSOs, intense heating from the central protostar may have caused substantial sublimation of methanol ice in the inner regions of their envelopes, thereby systematically lowering the observed CH$_3$OH/H$_2$O ice ratios.
#### Impact of Newly Measured Nuclear Reaction Rates on $^{26}$Al Ejected Yields from Massive Stars

 - **Abstract**
 Over the last three years, the rates of all the main nuclear reactions involving the destruction and production of $^{26}$Al in stars ($^{26}$Al(n, p)$^{26}$Mg, $^{26}$Al(n, $\alpha$)$^{23}$Na, $^{26}$Al(p, $\gamma$)$^{27}$Si and $^{25}$Mg(p, $\gamma$)$^{26}$Al) have been re-evaluated thanks to new high-precision experimental measurements of their cross sections at energies of astrophysical interest, considerably reducing the uncertainties in the nuclear physics affecting their nucleosynthesis. We computed the nucleosynthetic yields ejected by the explosion of a high-mass star (20 Msun, Z = 0.0134) using the FRANEC stellar code, considering two explosion energies, 1.2 10$^{51}$ erg and 3 10$^{51}$ erg. We quantify the change in the ejected amount of $^{26}$Al and other key species that is predicted when the new rate selection is adopted instead of the reaction rates from the STARLIB nuclear library. Additionally, the ratio of our ejected yields of 26Al to those of 14 other short-lived radionuclides (36Cl, 41Ca, 53Mn, 60Fe, 92Nb, 97Tc, 98Tc, 107Pd, 126Sn, 129I, 36Cs, 146Sm, 182Hf, 205Pb) are compared to early solar system isotopic ratios, inferred from meteorite measurements. The total ejected 26Al yields vary by a factor of ~3 when adopting the new rates or the STARLIB rates. Additionally, the new nuclear reaction rates also impact the predicted abundances of short-lived radionuclides in the early solar system relative to $^{26}$Al. However, it is not possible to reproduce all the short-lived radionuclide isotopic ratios with our massive star model alone, unless a second stellar source could be invoked, which must have been active in polluting the pristine solar nebula at a similar time of a core-collapse supernova.

 - **Abstract**
 Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) often exhibit a three-part structure consisting of a bright inner core, an outer leading edge, and an intervening dark cavity. While the core has traditionally been attributed to prominence material, an alternative interpretation suggests it may arise from the projection effects of a twisted flux rope. We focused on limb CME events to reassess the connection between CME cores and their associated prominences in the inner corona. The CME cores were analyzed using white-light observations from the Mauna Loa Solar Observatory (MLSO) K-Coronagraph (K-Cor), while the corresponding prominence eruptions were examined using H$\alpha$ data from the Global Oscillation Network Group (GONG) and 304 Å images from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA). Our results show a strong spatial correspondence between H$\alpha$ prominences and CME cores in white light, with an average image correlation of $\sim$0.7, while correlations between white light and AIA 304 Å are comparatively weaker ($\sim$0.5). Several events could be continuously traced into the Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph Experiment (LASCO/C2) field of view, confirming the persistence of prominence material into the outer corona. We find back-extrapolating LASCO/C2 CME cores under constant-velocity, linear-trajectory assumptions can introduce large errors -- up to 40$^\circ$ in inferred position angle and $\sim$140 minutes in eruption time relative to their true values -- underscoring the importance of inner-coronal observations for accurately constraining CME dynamics. Overall, our findings suggest that in prominence-associated CMEs, the bright cores are predominantly composed of prominence material.

 - **Abstract**
 The recent microcalorimetric X-ray observations of the Coma cluster by XRISM have sparked active discussion regarding the physical origin of its gas velocity features. Here, we demonstrate that an off-axis minor merger in its early phase $-$ when the infalling subhalo is near its primary apocenter and the stripped tail is not yet mixed with the main cluster atmosphere $-$ can drive intracluster gas motions generally consistent with the XRISM results. These include a pronounced velocity gradient and an approximately uniform velocity dispersion of $\simeq100-200\,\rm{km\,s^{-1}}$ in the cluster core. Our merger scenario was originally suggested in Lyskova et al. (2019) to reproduce the major X-ray morphological features of Coma. In addition, we introduce a simple and robust diagnostic of intracluster gas motions based on the ratio of the line-of-sight velocity to the velocity dispersion.
#### Radial differential rotation leading to dipole collapse in pre-main-sequence stars

 - **Abstract**
 Despite progress in the observations of stellar magnetic fields, their physical mechanisms remain poorly understood. During the pre-main sequence (PMS) phase, the inner layers of stars contract and a radiative core gradually develops. In contrast, the convective envelope is gradually braked through magnetic interactions with the accretion disk and winds. With developing differential rotation inside the star, PMS phase is thus a critical period for magnetic properties of stars when strong initial dipoles can get perturbed, leading to the observed diversity in the magnetism on the main sequence (MS). In this work, we study the impact of differential rotation on such fields. We perform three-dimensional anelastic convective dynamo simulations of rotating spherical shells with an imposed differential rotation (shear) between the boundaries. Density, gravity profiles and convective zone thicknesses were set close to those predicted in PMS low-mass stars by one-dimensional stellar evolution code Cesam2k20. Our results show that radial differential rotation can induce dipole collapse leading to weaker, oscillatory magnetic fields. Differential rotation seems to perturb $\alpha^2$ dynamo mechanism, responsible for dipolar magnetic fields, by shearing poloidal field lines and by affecting turbulent magnetic transport processes. This collapse is moderated by the relative importance of shear compared to the vigor of convective motions, with exact stability criterion depending on the field strength and the size of the radiative core. Applying DNS-based stability criterion in PMS stellar evolution models, we qualitatively reproduce the trends observed in the magnetic topologies of low-mass stars when assuming an efficient internal angular momentum redistribution. This suggests that stellar magnetic properties are intimately related to the PMS angular momentum evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 The study of galaxy groups is essential to understanding the evolutionary history of large-scale structures in the Universe. These dense environments have a significant impact on galaxy evolution, influencing their gas content, morphology, and star formation activity. In this work we analyse in detail the system NGC~5098$/$5096 composed of two galaxy groups. We performed hydrodynamical $N$-body simulations of a galaxy group collision aimed at reproducing the gas sloshing and surface brightness distribution observed in X-ray data. We conducted a detailed X-ray analysis and generated mock image \textit{Chandra} observations from our simulations. The resulting corrected mock image surface brightness profiles show good agreement with the observed data. The relative line-of-sight velocity between NGC~5098 and NGC~5096 is $v_{\mathrm{los}} = 700$ km s$^{-1}$, with a projected separation of $d_{\mathrm{proj}} = 155$ kpc, suggesting that the collision occurs nearly in the line-of-sight. Our simulations were performed with an inclination angle of $80^\circ$ in order to reproduce the dynamical constraints. We also find a correlation between the dark matter and intragroup light distributions when comparing the residual dark matter map with the intragroup light morphology. Our best-fitting model is consistent with these observational constraints and provides a plausible dynamical scenario for the current state of the NGC~5098 group interaction with NGC 5096.
#### VENUS: Two Faint Little Red Dots Separated by $\sim70\,\mathrm{pc}$ Hidden in a Single Lensed Galaxy at $z\sim7$

 - **Abstract**
 We report the identification of a pair of faint little red dots (LRDs), dubbed Red Eyes, in a strongly-lensed galaxy at $z\sim7$ behind the PLCKG004.5-10.5 cluster, identified from the JWST Treasury program VENUS. Red Eyes are spatially resolved on the image plane with distinct colors, while the critical curve lies far north of Red Eyes, clearly requiring two different LRDs rather than a single LRD. Red Eyes is an extremely close pair of LRDs separated by $\sim70\,\mathrm{pc}$ in the source plane with a magnification of $\mu\sim20$, which consistently explains another counter-image detected to the north-west. Red Eyes is hosted in a typical star-forming galaxy with $M_{\mathrm{UV,int}}\sim -19$, but its own UV emission is very faint ($M_{\mathrm{UV,int}} \gtrsim -16$). Moreover, Red Eyes does not reside at the galaxy center but lies at an offset position of approximately one effective radius $R_{\mathrm{e}}$ away from the galaxy center. If observed without lensing, Red Eyes would appear as a typical star-forming galaxy at $z\sim 7$ with $M_{\mathrm{UV}}\sim -19$, showing no apparent LRD signatures in either morphology or SED. These results suggest that multiple off-center LRDs, similar to Red Eyes, may be commonly hidden in a typical high-$z$ star-forming galaxy. In this case, various plausible scenarios may emerge, one of which is that intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) with $M_\mathrm{BH}\sim10^{4\text{--}6}\,M_\odot$ may form in star clusters on a stellar disk and contribute to the growth of the central supermassive black hole via mergers, with some IMBHs detectable as luminous LRDs in a sufficiently active and massive phase.

 - **Abstract**
 Gravitational waves from core-collapse supernovae provide a unique probe of the equation of state (EOS) of high density matter. In this work, we focus on the bounce signal from numerical simulations of rotating supernovae and explore its potential for EOS inference. We employ a support vector machine, previously shown to perform best among tested methods, to classify GW signals simulated for 18 EOS models. For optimally oriented sources, we estimate that the Advanced LIGO A+ detector can probe the EOS for Galactic events, while third-generation observatories such as the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer can reach substantially farther. For randomly oriented sources, only these next-generation detectors are expected to have sufficient sensitivity. These results represent the potential observational range for probing the nuclear EOS, although, due to the simplifying assumptions adopted, they should be regarded as approximate upper limits.

 - **Abstract**
 The correlation between optical starlight polarization and polarized thermal dust emission can be used to infer intrinsic dust properties. This correlation is quantified by the ratio Rp/p, which has been measured to be 5.42 +/- 0.05 MJy sr^-1 at 353 GHz when averaged over large areas of the sky. We investigate this correlation using newly published stellar polarimetric data densely sampling a continuous sky region of ~4 square degrees at intermediate Galactic latitude. We combine RoboPol optical polarization measurements for 1,430 stars with submillimeter data from the Planck satellite at 353 GHz. We perform linear fits between the Planck (Qs, Us) and optical (qv, uv) Stokes parameters, accounting for the differences in resolution between the two datasets as well as the distribution of clouds along the line of sight. We find that in this region of the sky the Rp/p value is 3.67 +/- 0.05 MJy sr^-1, indicating a significantly shallower slope than that found previously using different stellar samples. We also find significant differences in the fitted slopes when fitting the Qs-qv and Us-uv data separately. We explore two explanations using mock data: miscalibration of polarization angle and variations in Rp/p along the line of sight due to multiple clouds. We show that the former can produce differences in the correlations of Qs-qv and Us-uv, but large miscalibration angles would be needed to reproduce the magnitude of the observed differences. Our simulations favor the interpretation that Rp/p differs between the two dominant clouds that overlap on the sky in this region. The difference in Rp/p suggests that the two clouds may have distinct dust polarimetric properties. With knowledge from the tomographic decomposition of the stellar polarization, we find that one cloud appears to dominate the correlation of Us-uv, while both clouds contribute to the correlation of the Qs-qv data.

 - **Abstract**
 Multiplicity is ubiquitous among massive stars. While the stellar components usually display similar masses, some binaries with extremely low mass ratios were also observed. Some of them are primordial, while others arise from binary interactions. The identification of systems with extreme mass ratios brings valuable information, notably on the origin of fast rotation in massive stars. We identify new short-period systems with extreme mass ratios through the detection of eclipses and reflection effects. The physical properties of a dozen newly identified cases were precisely evaluated through high-quality photometry and spectroscopy. In addition to characterizing these binaries, we found a clear signature of apsidal motion in one system, and three other systems display long-term shifts in eclipse times. All systems we reported here are composed of a massive star and a cool low-mass companion. They are therefore primordial cases. This doubles the known number of these systems in the Galaxy. In this context, it is important to note that most massive stars in these systems, as well as in previous systems reported in the literature, rotate fast (supersynchronous compared to the orbital motion). The high incidence of fast rotation in these nascent binaries provides strong constraints for star formation models.

 - **Abstract**
 Volcanism on Venus has never been directly observed, but several measurements indicate present-day activity. Volcanism could potentially play a role in climatic processes on Venus, especially in the sulfur cycle like on Earth. Observation of volcanic activity is the primary objective of future Venus spacecraft. However, there are many unknowns regarding its Venusian characteristics, like the condition at the vent, the volatile content and composition. Past modelling efforts have only studied explosive volcanic plume propagation over a limited range of flow parameters at the vent and in an idealised Venus atmospheric configuration. We propose to use the 1D FPLUME volcanic plume model in a realistic Venusian environment. In similar Venusian conditions, the height of the plume is consistent with past modelling. The present study shows that explosive volcanism would preferably reach 15 km of altitude. Under certain conditions, plumes are able to reach the VenSpec-H tropospheric altitude range of observations and even the 45 km cloud floor. For the first time, the impact of wind was quantified, and the super-rotating winds have a substantial impact by plume-bending of reducing the height of plumes. Contrary to the Earth, the atmospheric heat capacity depends greatly on temperature, and will disadvantage lower plumes and allow larger plumes to propagate at higher altitudes. The high latitude atmospheric environment, due to the thermal profile and weaker winds, is favorable to plumes reaching higher altitudes.
#### The lack of fast rotators in Cyg OB2. I. Insights from spectral reclassification of its B0 population

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Cygnus OB2, in the Cygnus X complex -- one of the most active star-forming regions of the Galaxy -- hosts hundreds of O- and B-type stars at different evolutionary stages. This association provides a unique laboratory to study massive star evolution and dynamics. However, despite extensive studies, the absence of a fast-rotating group ($v\sin{i}>200\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$) among the O-type population of Cygnus OB2 challenges current models of massive star evolution. Aims. Stellar rotation strongly impacts spectral line shapes of O-type stars, and high rotation can potentially lead to misclassifications. We investigate whether some stars in Cygnus OB2, classified at low spectral resolution as B0, are actually rapidly rotating late-O types. Such cases could explain the observed lack of fast rotators in Cygnus OB2. Methods. Accounting for rotation, we reclassify the known B0 population in Cygnus OB2, using the MGB tool and both new and pre-existing optical spectroscopy. Finally, we compute projected rotational velocities using iacob-broad. Results. About $19\,\%$ of the initial B0 population in Cygnus OB2 are, in fact, late-O types. Only 6 stars in the entire dataset show $v\sin{i}>200\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$, with just 1 new O-type star exceeding this threshold. Conclusions. In our study of Cygnus OB2, we continue to find a notable lack of fast rotators among its O-type population. We propose a combination of three factors as the most likely explanation: (i) the young age of Cygnus OB2 may imply that fast rotators has not been produced yet due to binary interactions; (ii) fast rotators may have been dynamically ejected from the core as runaway stars; (iii) local star formation conditions may hinder binary formation (reducing spin-up interactions) or result in slower rotational velocities at birth.
#### Molecular line emission from 1000 au scales outflows to <30 au compact structures in NGC1333 IRAS4A2

 - **Abstract**
 Aims. Studying protostellar objects in their earliest stages, particularly during the Class 0 phase, provides key insight into the beginnings of planet formation and dust evolution. Disentangling the various components, however, is particularly challenging. High spatial and spectral resolution observations of molecular line emission with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) are therefore crucial for probing their complex environments. Methods. In this work, we present high-resolution ($\sim$30 au) ALMA observations at 1.3 millimeters of the Class 0 protostellar system IRAS4A2. Results. We detected large, well-traced outflows in HCN (3-2), H$_{2}$CO$(2_{1~2}-1_{1~1})$, and HCO$^{+}$ (3-2), along with numerous complex organic molecules (COMs) tracing central, more compact regions. Using moment maps, we analyzed the kinematics and spatial distributions of the molecular emission, revealing a wide range of spatial scales, from compact structures within the IRAS4A2 core at $\sim$8 au in radius, to extended $\sim$5000 au outflow emission. Specifically, we find that CH$_{3}$CDO and CH$_{3}$OCHO could be both good tracers of the disk, possibly tracing its rotation. Lines of OCS (22-21), SO$_{2}~(13_{3~11}-13_{2~12})$, HCN, H$_{2}$CO, and HCO$^{+}$, show more extended structures around IRAS4A2, likely tracing the envelope, disk, accretion shocks, the base of an outflow, and the outflow itself. Conclusions. Most COMs appear to trace distinct inner regions near the central protostar, while other molecules trace more extended structures, such as the envelope or outflows. The kinematics, emission patterns, and position-velocity diagrams suggest that individual molecules trace multiple components simultaneously, making it challenging to disentangle their true origins. Altogether, these findings highlight the complex spatial distribution within the IRAS4A2 system. Abridged.
#### Spectroscopic Follow-up of Young High-$α$ Dwarf Star Candidates: Still Likely Genuinely Young

 - **Abstract**
 The question of whether genuinely young high-$\alpha$ stars exist has been discussed for over a decade since their discovery from asteroseismology of giant stars as it is challenging to break the degeneracy between the binary interaction and the genuinely young scenarios. Young high-$\alpha$ stars are hard to explain with traditional chemical evolution model as the high-$\alpha$ disk is typically associated with the early epoch of star formation in the Milky Way. Combined with recent advances of gyrochronology, and that $^7$Li can serve as an unambiguous indicator for identifying merger products in dwarfs thanks to its low burning temperature, we identified young high-$\alpha$ dwarf candidate stars through their fast rotation in a previous study. In this paper, we performed high-resolution spectroscopic follow-up of these candidates using Potsdam Echelle Polarimetric and Spectroscopic Instrument (PEPSI), and confirm 3 additional stars that are most likely genuinely young. Together with the star from the earlier paper, we find three out of four of them center around [Fe/H]=-0.5 dex, are ~5 Gyr old, and have a similar amount of elevated Li (~0.5 dex) and Al (~0.1 dex) compared to stars with matching $\log g$, $T_{\rm eff}$, Mg, and Fe within observational uncertainties, hinting at their common formation pathway.
#### Glycolaldehyde and ethanol toward the L1157 outflow: resolved images and constraints on glycolaldehyde formation

 - **Abstract**
 Two main formation routes have been proposed for interstellar complex organic molecules (iCOMs): on dust grain surfaces and in the gas phase. Observing such molecules in protostellar outflow shock regions - provided that their ages are well-constrained - can help distinguish between these pathways by probing chemical evolution over time. This study focuses on the potential daughter-mother relationship of glycolaldehyde (CH$_2$OHCHO) and ethanol (C$_2$H$_5$OH), previously proposed in the literature. We test whether gas-phase reactions converting ethanol into glycolaldehyde derived in these works can explain the observed abundance of the latter in star-forming regions. We target the southern outflow of L1157, which hosts three shock regions, B0, B1 and B2, of increasing ages: about 900, 1500 and 2300 yr. We obtained high-resolution IRAM NOEMA maps of three lines of glycolaldehyde and one line of ethanol. We derived their abundances in the three shocks and used a pseudo time-dependent astrochemical model to simulate gas-phase and grain-surface formation scenarios for glycolaldehyde. Ethanol is assumed to form on grains and be released in the gas by shocks, where it is gradually converted into glycolaldehyde via the ethanol-tree reaction network. We present the first spatially resolved maps of glycolaldehyde and ethanol in the L1157 southern outflow, and more generally toward solar-like star forming regions. The abundance ratio [CH$_2$OHCHO]/[C$_2$H$_5$OH] increases from B1 to B2, consistent with model predictions. However, the model cannot reproduce all three shocked regions simultaneously, suggesting that one of the assumptions of our model, such as the same excitation temperature and grain composition in B0, B1 and B2, or gas temperature evolution, is wrong. Nonetheless, our modeling rules out the possibility that all the observed gaseous glycolaldehyde is a grain-surface product.

 - **Abstract**
 In the field of deep space radiation shielding design, traditional high-Z metals are being progressively replaced by novel low-Z materials such as hydrogenated graphene foam, polyethylene-carbon nanotube composite fibers, and boron-rich hydrogen-containing metal-organic frameworks. This transition stems from the constraints of the "gram-scale weight reduction" bottleneck. However, the mechanisms behind these materials' outstanding "lightweight performance" remain at the purely phenomenological level. To address this issue, this paper innovatively proposes a ternary coupled semi-empirical model, with "proton density" (rho_p) as the core independent variable (equivalent to electron density), establishing correlations with full absorption threshold (Eth) and proton utilization rate (eta_p). To validate the model's practicality in complex system design, we embedded it into the NSGA-II genetic algorithm (POP=20, MAXGEN=10). Under constraints of 2-5 layer structures with total thickness <=1 cm, the model's predicted optimal solutions showed an average design error of only 6.2%-8.2% compared to Geant4 heavy simulation dose results. This study provides the first quantitative physical explanation of the inherent trade-off between low-Z materials' "mass savings" and high-Z materials' "space savings." When rho_p<1 mol cm^-3, materials demonstrate extremely high proton utilization rates (eta_p reaching 60-100 MeV cm^-2 mol^-1), achieving 35%-55% mass savings. Conversely, when rho_p>1 mol cm^-3, although eta_p drops below 30 MeV cm^-2 mol^-1, its exceptionally high full absorption threshold (Eth) enables ultra-thin shielding technology. This work offers a robust, physically interpretable, and scalable design tool for multi-objective optimization of area density, thickness, and dose in deep space missions.

 - **Abstract**
 The Roman Galactic Plane Survey (RGPS) is a 700-hour program approved for early definition as a community-designed General Astrophysics Survey. It was selected following a proposal call for science programs that would benefit from an early community-based definition (Sanderson et al 2024). The community was invited to submit white papers and science pitches with a deadline of May 20, 2024; the Roman Galactic Plane Survey Definition Committee (RGPS-DC) first met on Sep 11, 2024. Based on the input provided, the RGPS-DC recommends a survey consisting of three elements: (1) a wide-field science element (691 sq deg, 541 hrs) covering the Galactic plane, Galactic latitude |b|<2 deg and Galactic longitude l=+50.1 deg to -79 deg (281 deg), in four filters (F129, F159, F184, and F213) with higher latitude extensions for the bulge, the Serpens South/W40 star formation region, and Carina, (2) a time-domain science element (19 sq deg , 130 hrs) of six fields, including the full Nuclear Stellar Disk (NSD) and Central Molecular Zone (CMZ), with coverage in seven filters and repeat observations in one or more filters with cadences from 11 minutes to weeks, and (3) a deep-field/spectroscopic science element (4 sq deg , 30 hrs) consisting of fifteen Roman pointings (with a wide range of extinction, diffuse emission, stellar density and population) using longer exposure times in seven filters in addition to grism and prism observations. This document summarizes the science that can be done with this survey, the process of survey definition, and details on all of the program elements.

 - **Abstract**
 Most star clusters dissolve into the Galaxy over tens to hundreds of millions of years after they form. While recent Gaia studies have honed our view of cluster dispersal, the exact chronology of which star formation events begat which star cluster remnants remains unclear. This problem is acute after 100 Myr, when cluster remnants have spread over hundreds of parsecs and most age estimates for main sequence stars are too imprecise to link the stars to their birth events. Here we develop a Bayesian framework that combines TESS stellar rotation rates with Gaia kinematics to identify diffuse remnants of open clusters. We apply our method to the Pleiades, which previous studies have noted shows kinematic similarities to other nearby young stellar groups. We find that the Pleiades constitutes the bound core of a much larger, coeval structure that contains multiple known clusters distributed over 600 pc. We refer to this structure as the Greater Pleiades Complex. On the basis of uniform ages, coherent space velocities, detailed elemental abundances, and traceback histories, we conclude that most stars in this complex originated from the same giant molecular cloud. This work establishes a scalable approach for tracing the genealogies of nearby clusters and further cements the Pleiades as a cornerstone of stellar astrophysics. We aim to apply this methodology to other associations as part of the upcoming TESS All-Sky Rotation Survey.

 - **Abstract**
 The physical mechanisms driving neutrino and electromagnetic flares in blazars remain poorly understood. We investigate a prominent multi-messenger flare in the quasar PKS 0446+11 to identify the processes responsible for its high-energy emission. We analyze the IceCube-240105A high-energy neutrino event together with contemporaneous observations in the gamma-ray, X-ray, optical, and radio bands. The on- and off-flare spectral energy distributions (SEDs) are modeled within a single-zone leptohadronic framework. Multi-epoch VLBA observations from the MOJAVE program provide parsec-scale polarization data that complement the multi-wavelength light curves. No significant time delay is detected between the neutrino arrival and the flares in different energy bands. This is consistent with an extremely small jet viewing angle below 1 deg, inferred from the parsec-scale polarization structure. The flare can be reproduced by the injection of a proton population and an increase of the Doppler factor from 18 to 24. We also detect an approximately 90 deg rotation of the EVPA in the parsec-scale core during the initial phase of the flare, indicating the emergence of a shock formed by the change in the bulk plasma speed. Our comprehensive multi-messenger analysis demonstrates that the extreme beaming and sub-degree viewing angle of this distant blazar can account for the observed neutrino and electromagnetic activity. These findings strengthen the case for blazars as efficient accelerators of hadrons and as significant contributors to the observed high-energy neutrino flux.
#### Emission line models for the lowest mass core-collapse supernovae -- II. Full 3D NLTE radiative transfer modelling of a $9.0\,M_\odot$ neutrino-driven explosion

 - **Abstract**
 The nebular phase of a supernova (SN) occurs several months to years after the explosion, when the ejecta become mostly optically thin yet there still is sufficient radioactive material to keep the supernova bright. The asymmetries created by the explosion are encoded into the line profiles of the emission lines which appear in the nebular phase. In order to make accurate predictions for these line profiles, Non-Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (NLTE) radiative transfer calculations need to be carried out. In this work, we use \texttt{ExTraSS} (EXplosive TRAnsient Spectral Simulator) -- which was recently upgraded into a full 3D NLTE radiative transfer code (including photoionization and line-by-line transfer effects) -- to carry out such calculations. \texttt{ExTraSS} is applied to a 3D explosion model of a $9.0\,M_\odot$ H-rich progenitor which is evolved into the homologous phase. Synthetic spectra are computed and the lines from different elements are studied for varying viewing angles. The model spectra are also compared against observations of SN 1997D and SN 2016bkv. The model is capable of creating good line profile matches for both SNe, and reasonable luminosity matches for He, C, O, and Mg lines for SN 1997D -- however H$\alpha$ and Fe I lines are too strong.

 - **Abstract**
 Neutron stars (NSs) provide a unique laboratory to probe dark matter (DM) through its gravitational imprint on stellar evolution. We use a two-fluid framework with non-annihilating, asymmetric DM, both fermionic and bosonic, that interacts with ordinary matter (OM) solely through gravity. Within this framework, we track proto-neutron stars (PNSs) across their thermal and compositional evolution via quasi-static modeling over the Kelvin--Helmholtz cooling timescale. We uncover a distinct thermal signature: DM cores deepen the gravitational potential, compressing and heating the baryonic matter, while extended DM halos provide external support, leading to cooling of the stellar matter. In contrast, hyperons and other exotic baryons soften the equation of state similarly to DM cores but reduce, rather than increase, the temperature. DM thus alters both temperature and particle distribution profiles in ways that provide a clear diagnostic of its presence. DM cores also enhance compactness and shift hyperon onset, with the strongest effects during deleptonization and neutrino-transparent phases due to reduced neutrino pressure contributions. Consequently, this early thermal evolution, observable through supernova neutrino light curves and young pulsar cooling curves, offers a direct, testable probe of DM in NSs.

 - **Abstract**
 Intermediate-mass stars (1-3 Msun) host some of the brightest and best-studied debris discs. This stellar class is also the most frequent host of molecular gas in systems older than typical protoplanetary disc lifetimes, and the most likely to host detected giant planets in radial-velocity surveys. The debris discs of intermediate-mass stars have therefore become fertile ground for studying disc-planet interactions. In this work, we present the first ALMA observations toward the A-type star HD 126062, located in Upper Centaurus Lupus / Lower Centaurus Crux, with the aim of characterising its debris disc. We probed the thermal continuum emission using observations at 1.3 mm, analysed through image reconstruction under different visibility-weighting regimes and parametric model fitting to the observed visibilities. The setup also covered the frequency of the 12CO(2-1) line, allowing imaging of gas near the system. We detected dust continuum emission from an exo-Kuiper belt around HD 126062. Modelled as a Gaussian ring, the visibilities are consistent with a radial separation R = 2.01'' (+0.04, -0.05), equivalent to ~270 (+5, -4) au, and a full width at half maximum DeltaR = 0.71'' +- 0.09 (95 +- 12 au). The continuum emission appears nearly face-on, with inclination <=17 deg. 12CO(2-1) emission is detected in the vicinity of the debris disc, with most of it located external to the exo-Kuiper belt. The exo-Kuiper belt characterised here is among the largest yet detected and agrees with previous predictions of the dust distribution based on spectral energy distribution fitting. The morphology and velocity offset relative to the systemic velocity suggest that the gas is not associated with the star or disc, but likely originates from a diffuse cloud in the nearby galaxy.
#### From Feedback-Free Star Clusters to Little Red Dots via Compaction

 - **Abstract**
 We address the origin of the Little Red Dots (LRDs) seen by JWST at cosmic morning ($z \!=\! 4 \!-\! 8$) as compact stellar systems with over-massive black holes (BHs). We propose that LRDs form naturally after feedback-free starbursts (FFB) in thousands of star clusters and following wet compaction. Analytically, we show how the clusters enable efficient dry migration of stars and BHs to the galaxy center by two-body segregation and dynamical friction against the disk. The clusters merge to form compact central clusters as observed. Mutual tidal stripping does not qualitatively affect the analysis. The young, rotating clusters are natural sites for the formation of BH seeds via rapid core collapse. The migrating clusters carry the BH seeds, which merge into central super-massive BHs (SMBHs). Compactions are required to deepen the potential wells such that the SMBHs are retained after post-merger gravitational-wave recoils, locked to the galaxy centers. Using cosmological simulations at different epochs, with different codes and physical recipes, we evaluate the additional growth of LRD-matching compact central stellar systems by global compaction events. Adding to the dry growth by cluster mergers, the compactions can increase the escape velocities to retain the SMBHs. The LRDs appear at $z \!\sim\! 8$, after the formation of FFB clusters, and disappear after $z \!\sim\! 4$ when the stellar mass is above $10^9 M_\odot$ by growing post-compaction blue disks around the nuclear LRDs. The LRD abundance is expected to be $\sim\! 10^{-5} \!-\! 10^{-4}\,{\rm Mpc}^{-3}$, increasing from $z \!\sim\! 4$ to $z\!\sim\! 8$.

 - **Abstract**
 Wide-field, multi-filter photometric surveys enable the reconstruction of the Milky Way's star formation history (SFH) on Galactic scales and offer new insights into disc assembly. The twelve-filter system of the Javalambre Photometric Local Universe Survey (J-PLUS) is particularly suitable, as its colours trace stellar chemical abundances and help alleviate the age-metallicity degeneracy in colour-magnitude diagram fitting. We aim to recover the SFH of the Galactic disc and separate its chemically distinct components by combining J-PLUS DR3 photometry with Gaia astrometry. We also evaluate the potential of isochrone fitting to estimate stellar ages and metallicities as proxies for evolutionary trends. We fit magnitudes and parallaxes of $1.38\times10^{6}$ stars using a Bayesian multiple isochrone method. The bright region of the colour-absolute-magnitude diagram ($M_{r}\leq4.2$ mag) constrains ages, while the faint region provides an empirical metallicity prior mitigating the age-metallicity degeneracy. Both PARSEC and BaSTI isochrones, in solar-scaled and $\alpha$-enhanced forms, are adopted. The recovered SFH reveals two sequences: an $\alpha$-enhanced population forming rapidly between $12.5$ and $8$ Gyr ago, enriching from [M/H]$\sim-0.6$ to $0.1$ dex; and a solar-scaled sequence emerging $\sim8$ Gyr ago, dominating after $\sim7$ Gyr with slower enrichment reaching solar metallicity by $3$ Gyr. Metal-rich ([M/H]$\gtrsim0$) stars are confined to $\vert z_{GC}\vert\lesssim1$ kpc, whereas metal-poor ([M/H]$\lesssim-0.5$) stars reach $\vert z_{GC}\vert\sim2$ kpc. Simultaneous fitting of both isochrone families reveals distinct formation epochs for the thin and thick discs. J-PLUS multi-filter photometry, combined with Gaia parallaxes, mitigates age-metallicity degeneracies and enables detailed mapping of the Milky Way's temporal and chemical evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 Metal-rich asteroids and iron meteorites are considered core remnants of differentiated planetesimals and or products of oxygen-depleted accretion. Investigating the origins of iron-rich planetesimals could provide key insights into planet formation mechanisms. Using differentiation models, we evaluate the interior structure and composition of representative-sized planetesimals (approx. 200 km diameter) while varying oxygen fugacity and initial bulk meteoritic composition. Under the oxygen-poor conditions that likely existed early in the inner regions of the Solar System and other protoplanetary disks, core fractions remain relatively consistent across a range of bulk compositions (CI, H, EH, and CBa). Some of these cores could incorporate significant amounts of silicon (10-30 wt percent) and explain the metal fractions of Fe-rich bodies in the absence of mantle stripping. Conversely, planetesimals forming under more oxidizing conditions, such as beyond snow lines, could exhibit smaller cores enriched in carbon, sulfur (more than 1 wt percent), and oxides. Sulfur-rich cores, like those formed from EH and H bulk compositions, could remain partly molten, sustain dynamos, and even drive sulfur-rich volcanism. Additionally, bodies with high carbon contents, such as CI compositions, can form graphitic outer layers. These variations highlight the importance of initial formation conditions in shaping planetesimal structures. Future missions, such as NASA's Psyche mission, offer an opportunity to measure the relative abundances of key elements (Fe, Ni, Si, and S) necessary to distinguish among formation scenarios and structure models for Fe-rich and reduced planetesimals.

 - **Abstract**
 We study an entropy-based framework to analyze gravitational-wave signals from core-collapse supernovae. We use waveforms generated by numerical simulations and analyze them in both the time domain and the time-frequency domain using short-time Fourier and continuous wavelet transforms. From each representation, we compute four entropy measures -- Shannon, exponential, Rényi, and Tsallis -- and apply three feature selection methods to identify the most informative features. We then train machine-learning classifiers on these features to compare the performance of different methodological combinations. We find that the combination of Rényi entropy from the wavelet domain and the Relief-F selection method yields the most effective discrimination among different gravitational-wave signals.

 - **Abstract**
 The angular momentum evolution of stars is crucial for understanding the formation and evolution of stars and star clusters. Using high-resolution magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) simulations of star formation in clouds with different physical properties, we study the initial distribution of stellar rotation periods in young clusters. We compare these results with observations of young Galactic clusters. Simulations qualitatively reproduce the observed trend of increasing rotation period with stellar mass. Additionally, simulations with lower virial parameter (ratio of turbulence to gravity) or solenoidal turbulence driving produce period-mass distributions that more closely match the observed ones. These simulations also recover the break in the mass-period relation. However, the break appears at higher masses than in observations and is absent in the youngest simulated clusters. This suggests that the emergence of the break is an important diagnostic of angular momentum evolution during the earliest stages of cluster formation. The simulations yield stars that rotate about an order of magnitude faster than those observed. This discrepancy mainly reflects the earlier evolutionary stage of the simulations, while unresolved physical interactions between stars and discs might also contribute. This conclusion is supported by simulations showing a significant period increase within 0.1-1 Myr. We quantify the required angular-momentum loss by rescaling simulated rotation periods to match observations, finding that 80-95% of the initial angular momentum must be removed within the first Myr. Our results highlight that understanding the earliest stages of star cluster formation is fundamental to addressing the angular momentum problem.
#### Investigating star formation scenarios in the Milky Way using YSO distributions - A pilot study

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.08175

 - **Abstract**
 We investigated the distributions of classified young stellar object (YSO) in nine star-forming regions associated with Hii regions, namely Sh2-22, Sh2-19, Sh2-17, M16, M8, IC5070, Sh2-252, NGC2467 and M42, as a means of exploring the star formation scenarios (triggered or spontaneous) in the various regions. The YSO distributions of nine regions along the galactic longitudes and across different spiral arms were explored. It is noted that Sh2-22 and Sh2-19 may have evidence of localized triggered star formation, whereas Sh2-17 may be a spontaneous star forming region. The results showed that the location within the Milky Way may influence localized triggered star formation within individual regions. There is strong evidence that there are fewer older stars (Transition Disks) within the Outer regions of the Galaxy (2.91 +- 1.74%), accompanied by a higher number of Class I (32.49 +- 10.77%). This is different from the Inner Galactic regions where the Transition Disks are higher (32.93 +- 13.78%) as compared to low Class I sources (11.01 +- 4.81%). The number of Class II stars is relatively high and increases from the Inner regions (52.64 +- 10.07%) to Outer regions (64.54 +- 11.09%). These nine star-forming regions are not an accurate representation of locations throughout the Galaxy and the results may be biased.
#### A Simple Ray Acceleration Structure for Non-LTE Radiative Transfer

 - **Abstract**
 We present a novel ray acceleration structure for radiative transfer outside of local thermodynamic equilibrium (non-LTE), leveraging techniques from computer graphics to improve computational efficiency. By applying mipmapping (local recursive spatial averaging) and sparse voxel grids, we exploit spatial coherence and sparsity in astrophysical models to accelerate the formal solution of the radiative transfer equation. We introduce a variance-limited mipmapping (VLM) scheme with tunable error control, and extend it to handle anisotropic emission via two methods: velocity interpolation, and so-called "Core and Voigt". Our approach integrates a hierarchical digital differential analyzer (HDDA) for efficient ray traversal, which, combined with the mipmapping scheme achieves an order of magnitude speedup with less than 0.5 % error in the 99.9th percentile of the level populations. These methods are implemented in the DexRT code and demonstrate significant performance gains in realistic solar atmospheric models.
#### A Novel Parameterization for Rapid Cooling in Supernova Remnants, with applications to the Pa 30 nebula

 - **Abstract**
 We systematically study how cooling creates structural changes in supernova remnants as they evolve. Inspired by the peculiar morphology of the Pa 30 nebula, we adopt a framework in which to characterize supernova remnants under different degrees of cooling. Our cooling framework characterizes remnants with a singular parameter called $\beta$ that sets how rapidly the system's thermal energy is radiated or emitted away. A continuum of morphologies is created by the implementation of different cooling timescales. For $\beta \gtrsim 400$, or when the cooling timescale is shorter than $\approx \frac{1}{400}$ of the Sedov time, the ejecta is shaped into a filamentary structure similar to Pa 30. We explain the filament creation by the formation of Rayleigh-Taylor Instability fingers where cooling has prevented the Kelvin-Helmholtz Instability from overturning and mixing out the tips. The ejecta in these filaments have not decelerated and are moving almost completely ballistically at $\approx 95-100\%$ their free expansion speed. In this rapid cooling regime, an explosion energy $\approx 3.5 \times 10^{47}$ erg is inferred. We also propose the cooling mechanism required to create these structures necessitates removing energy at a rate of $2\%$ of $E_{\rm ej}/t$, which implies a cooling luminosity of $\approx 10^{36}$ erg/s.
#### Exploring the Impact of Systematic Bias in Type Ia Supernova Cosmology Across Diverse Dark Energy Parametrizations

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the impact of instrumental and astrophysical systematics on dark energy constraints derived from Type~Ia supernova (SN-Ia) observations. Using simulated datasets consistent with current SN-Ia measurements, we explore how uncertainties in photometric calibration, intergalactic dust, progenitor evolution in luminosity and light-curve stretch, and intrinsic color scatter affect the inferred dark energy equation of state parameters (w0, wa). We test the Generalised Scale Factor (GEN) evolution and benchmark it against three time-evolving dark energy models; namely Chevallier Polarski Linder (CPL), Jassal Bagla Padmanabhan (JBP) and Logarithmic (LOG) parametrizations; comparing their sensitivity to these systematic effects. Calibration biases and progenitor evolution emerge as the dominant sources of uncertainty, while simpler parametrisations, viz. GEN, which directly describes the expansion rate, remains relatively stable under all systematic injections, unlike CPL, JBP and LOG that rely on the dark energy equation of state. These findings underscore the need for sub-per cent calibration precision and enhanced astrophysical modelling to ensure the robustness of dark energy inferences from current and future SN-Ia cosmology experiments.

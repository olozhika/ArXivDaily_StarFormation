 - **Abstract**
 We validate Leonid Space's satellite lifetime prediction pipeline through comprehensive backtesting against 934 non-maneuvering satellites that deorbited from LEO between 1961 and 2024. This represents the first large-scale validation of lifetime prediction tooling using forecasted space weather conditions rather than historical hindsight. Our toolchain combines ballistic coefficient estimation from on-orbit data with probabilistic orbit propagation under varying environmental conditions. Using TLE data and space weather records spanning six solar cycles, our three-stage validation approach progressively removes hindsight bias to arrive at fully predictive operational conditions. We achieve 1-year prediction accuracy (median continuously ranked probability score) of 6.0 days (1.6%) under perfect knowledge conditions, 18.6 days (5.1%) with estimated ballistic coefficients and known space weather, and 45.5 days (12.4%) under fully predictive conditions. Comparison against ESA's standard DRAMA & DISCOS toolchain demonstrates a 4x improvement in state-of-the-art accuracy for well-characterized satellites. A custom semianalytic propagator provides a >3500x speedup over Orekit and 4.5x speedup over DRAMA, enabling rapid Monte Carlo analysis across large satellite populations. Our analysis reveals that solar cycle forecasting dominates error budgets after ballistic coefficient estimation, with higher-fidelity propagators and atmosphere models providing marginal benefit. These results establish a validated performance baseline for operational lifetime prediction services supporting LEO mission planning and regulatory compliance.

 - **Abstract**
 Determining where, when, and how neutrino flavor oscillations must be included in large-scale simulations of hot and dense astrophysical environments is an enduring challenge that must be tackled to obtain accurate predictions. Using an angular moment-based linear stability analysis framework, we examine the different kinds of flavor instabilities that can take place in the context of the post-processing of a neutron star merger simulation, with a particular focus on the collisional flavor instability and a careful assessment of several commonly used approximations. First, neglecting anisotropies of the neutrino field, we investigate the extent to which commonly used monoenergetic growth rates reproduce the results obtained from a full multi-energy treatment. Contrary to the large discrepancies found in core-collapse supernova environments, we propose a simple combination of energy-averaged estimates that reproduces the multi-energy growth rates in our representative simulation snapshot. We then quantify the impact of additional physical effects, including nuclear many-body corrections, scattering opacities, and the inclusion of the vacuum term in the neutrino Hamiltonian. Finally, we include the neutrino distribution anisotropies, which allows us to explore, for the first time in a multi-energy setting, the interplay between collisional, fast, and slow modes in a moment-based neutron star merger simulation. We find that despite a dominance of the fast instability in most of the simulation volume, certain regions only exhibit a collisional instability, while others, especially at large distances, exhibit a slow instability that is largely underestimated if anisotropic effects are neglected.
#### Resolving the Fe K$α$ Doublet of the Galactic Center Molecular Cloud G0.11-0.11 with XRISM

 - **Abstract**
 Fe K$\alpha$ line emission from Galactic center molecular clouds can be produced either via fluorescence after illumination by an X-ray source or by cosmic ray ionization. Unparalleled high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy obtained by XRISM-Resolve for the galactic center molecular cloud G0.11-0.11 resolves its Fe K$\alpha$ line complex for the first time, and points to a new method for discrimination between the X-ray reflection and cosmic ray ionization models. The Fe K$\alpha$ line complex is resolved into Fe K$\alpha_1$ at $E_{1} = 6.4040 \: \rm{keV}$ and Fe K$\alpha_2$ at $E_{2}= 6.3910 \:\rm{keV}$. Both lines have non-instrumental FWHM of $\approx 3 \:\rm{eV}$, close to the predicted quantum mechanical width of the lines, suggesting scant other sources of line broadening other than instrumental and quantum effects. We measure a radial velocity of $v_{\rm{LSR}} = 50 \pm 12_{fit} \pm 14_{scale} \:\rm{km/s}$ for G0.11-0.11, achieving the same precision reached by radio observations of such clouds. The high-resolution spectrum tests for the presence of secondary Fe K$\alpha$ lines, expected as a signature of cosmic ray proton/ion ionization. The absence of the secondary lines argues against the cosmic ray ionization model for G0.11-0.11. In the preferred X-ray reflection model, if the illuminating source is Sgr A$^{\star}$, the required luminosity for an X-ray outburst about 200 years ago is $L_8 \approx 10^{38} \:\rm{erg/s}$ in an $8\:\rm{keV}$-wide band at $8\:\rm{keV}$.

 - **Abstract**
 The intermediate neutron-capture process (i-process) can occur during proton ingestion events (PIEs), which may take place in the early evolutionary phases of asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars. We investigate the impact of rotational and magnetic mixing on i-process nucleosynthesis in low-metallicity, low-mass AGB stars. We computed AGB models with [Fe/H] = $-2.5$ and $-1.7$ and initial masses of 1 and 1.5 $M_{\odot}$ using the STAREVOL code, including a network of 1160 nuclei coupled to transport equations. Rotating models incorporate a calibrated Tayler-Spruit (TS) dynamo to account for core rotation rates inferred from asteroseismic observations of solar-metallicity sub-giants and giants. Initial rotation velocities of 0, 30, and 90 km s$^{-1}$ were considered, along with varying assumptions for magnetic mixing. We find that rotation without magnetic fields strongly suppresses the i-process due to the production of primary $^{14}$N, which is subsequently converted into $^{22}$Ne $-$ a potent neutron poison during the PIE. Including magnetic fields via the TS dynamo restores the models close to their non-rotating counterparts: strong core-envelope coupling suppresses shear mixing and prevents primary $^{14}$N synthesis, yielding i-process nucleosynthesis similar to non-rotating models. We also find that rotational mixing during the AGB phase is insufficient to affect the occurrence of PIEs. Proton ingestion event-driven nucleosynthesis proceeds similarly in asteroseismic-calibrated magnetic rotating AGB stars and non-rotating stars, producing identical abundance patterns.

 - **Abstract**
 Isotopic abundance ratios in protoplanetary disks are critical for understanding volatile inheritance and chemical evolution in planet-forming environments. We present Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array observations of the rare isotopologue 13C18O(2-1) at approximately 0.3 arcsec resolution from the disk around the Herbig Ae star HD 163296, combined with archival observations of C17O(2-1), C18O(1-0), and C17O(1-0), to empirically constrain carbon and oxygen isotopic ratios without detailed disk modeling. Both the C17O/13C18O(2-1) and C18O/C17O(1-0) flux ratios rise sharply across the CO snowline and flatten beyond 1.5 arcsec (r >= 150 au), where the emission becomes optically thin. This transition, reflecting a steep drop in CO column density set by the disk's thermal structure, makes HD 163296 an optimal case for isotopic analysis. Using beam-averaged intensities of the four transitions measured in this optically thin region, we derive isotopic ratios of 12C/13C = 75.3 (+14.7/-11.4) and 18O/17O = 3.28 (+0.31/-0.26), both consistent with local interstellar medium values. The 16O/18O ratio remains weakly constrained due to moderate optical depth in the C18O(1-0) line and degeneracy with CO column density. These results demonstrate that rare CO isotopologues can provide robust, empirical constraints on isotopic ratios in disks when sharp structural transitions allow for the identification of optically thin regions, and establish HD 163296 as a benchmark for extending such studies to other systems with resolved snowline structures.
#### Meteor observations as a tool to constrain cosmogonic models of the Solar System

 - **Abstract**
 Recent observations of small bodies of the Solar System showed evidence of the presence of refractory (asteroidal) material in the Oort cloud. Different models of the origin of the Solar System predict different numbers of rocky objects in the Oort cloud, meaning that measurement of this population can be used as an observational constraint for cosmogonic models. The aim of our work is to study how the data obtained from meteor observations can be used as a tool for distinguishing among the existing cosmogonic models. We investigated two meteor databases collected by the cameras of the All-Sky Meteor Orbit System (AMOS) located in the Canary Islands and in Chile. We describe methodology and results of the search for unusually strong rocky meteoroids on cometary orbits with the origin in the Oort cloud. These data will be used to calculate the fluxes of meteors of different compositions in order to constrain the ratio of icy and rocky components of the Oort cloud. For the flux determination, we estimate the observational time and effective area of the AMOS system.
#### Where does the simplified Stellar Contamination Model fail in Exoplanet Transmission Spectroscopy?

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar photospheric heterogeneities (e.g., starspots, faculae) distort the stellar spectrum in transit and imprint wavelength-dependent biases on the planet-to-star radius ratio (Transit Light Source Effect, TLSE). The Rackham-TLSE (R-TLSE) prescription applies a disc-averaged correction based solely on filling factor and spectral contrast, but transmission spectroscopy also depends on limb darkening, active-region distribution, and transit geometry. We include these in a pixel-resolved framework, ECLIPSE-Xlambda, and run idealised noise-free model-model comparisons to R-TLSE. For LHS 1140 b, K2-18 b, and WASP-69 b, disc-averaged corrections differ from the pixel model by up to about 400 ppm in the optical for active hosts and non-equatorial transits, but stay below about 10 ppm in the near-infrared where limb darkening is weak. We then apply both approaches to the JWST/NIRISS SOSS spectrum of LHS 1140 b. With limb darkening set to zero, ECLIPSE-Xlambda recovers stellar-contamination parameters matching the reference R-TLSE solution, confirming consistency in the disc-averaged limit. With wavelength-dependent limb darkening, reproducing the short-wavelength slope via stellar contamination alone requires hot faculae (delta Tfac about 600 K; ffac about 0.35), equivalent to a circular facular region of radius about 0.6 Rstar (about 60% of the stellar radius) on the disc; such an extended unocculted region is physically unlikely even for an active M dwarf. Purely stellar contamination would therefore require extreme faculae, whereas a genuine atmospheric contribution complementing a more modest facular signal is more plausible. These results delineate the validity regime of R-TLSE and underscore the need for geometry-aware stellar-heterogeneity models including limb darkening in high-precision transmission spectroscopy.

 - **Abstract**
 We present high-resolution near-infrared spectroscopic observations of the newly identified supernova remnant (SNR) candidate G25.8+0.2 obtained with the Immersion Grating Infrared Spectrograph (IGRINS) on the Harlan J. Smith Telescope. The source was originally discovered in the UKIRT Wide-field Infrared Survey for Fe+ (UWIFE; Lee et al. 2014). Our spectra reveal multiple kinematic components in the [Fe II] 1.644 um emission. The high-velocity components exhibit elevated [Fe II]/Br gamma ratios characteristic of shock excitation, while the low-velocity components are dominated by hydrogen and helium recombination lines and are consistent with photoionized gas, indicating an H II-region origin. G25.8+0.2 lies within the G26 complex, a large (~15'x 30', corresponding to ~28 pc x 57 pc at a distance of 6.5 kpc) star-forming region in the inner Galaxy. The shock-excited [Fe II] filaments closely trace the morphology of the bright radio shell that partially encloses centrally filled soft X-ray emission, strongly suggesting recent supernova activity in this region. We discuss the physical nature of G25.8+0.2 and its relationship to the surrounding G26 star-forming complex. In addition, we derive the extinction toward the source using Brackett-line ratios and constrain the spectral types of the dominant ionizing stars from the He I 2.058 um/Br gamma line ratios.
#### Finite Plasma Beta Three-dimensional Magnetic Field Extrapolation Based on MHD Relaxation Method

 - **Abstract**
 Three-dimensional (3D) magnetic field in the solar atmosphere provides crucial information to understand the explosive phenomenon such as solar flares and coronal mass ejections. Since it is still hard that we determine the 3D magnetic field from direct observation, a nonlinear force-free field (NLFFF) extrapolation is one of the best modeling methods that provides 3D magnetic field. However, the method is based on zero-beta assumption, i.e., the model ignores the gas pressure gradient and gravitational force. The magnetic field based on an NLFFF is not well reconstructed in high-beta region, such as in chromospheric or lower height layer and in weak field region. To overcome this problem, we need to consider the magnetohydrostatic equilibrium. In this study, we developed a finite plasma beta magnetic field extrapolation method based on magnetohydrodynamic relaxation method. In our method, we consider a force balance of the Lorentz force and the gas pressure. We tested three different schemes and extrapolated 3D magnetic field using an observational photospheric vector magnetic field of one solar active region, which is a quadrupole complex sunspot group and well studied with an NLFFF. The verification of three schemes is performed by comparing the residual force, and we concluded that our methods reduce ~4% of residual force of the previous NLFFF. We also examined the plasma beta profile along the height and found that, in the core of the active region, plasma beta reaches a local minimum of ~0.01 in the lower corona with beta ~1 at the photosphere.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a numerical investigation of nonlinear cluster lens reconstruction using weak lensing mass mapping. Recent advances in imaging and shear estimation have pushed reliable reduced shear measurements closer to cluster cores, making mass reconstruction accessible in the nonlinear regime. However, the Kaiser-Squires based algorithm becomes unstable in cluster cores, where convergence $\kappa$ significantly deviates from zero and the linear approximation breaks down. To address this limitation, we develop a reconstruction framework with two key modifications: applying smooth masks to these regions and using a model-derived analytical solution as the initial guess, rather than assuming $\kappa = 0$. We validate our framework using simulated cluster lensing data with known mass distributions, incorporating realistic masks that arise from limitations in reduced shear measurements. We show that in the absence of shape noise, our framework yields high-fidelity mass reconstruction in regions of large reduced shear, with the best-performing method achieving residuals below $0.02 \sigma$ in the unmasked regions. This pushes mass reconstruction to higher accuracy in the nonlinear regime.

 - **Abstract**
 We present new Rosseland and Planck mean opacity tables relevant to the shallow interiors and atmospheres of giant planets. The tables span metallicities from 0.31 to 50 times solar, temperatures from 100 - 6000 K, and pressures from 1e-6 - 1e5 bar, thereby covering a wider parameter space than previous data sets. Our calculations employ the latest molecular and atomic line lists and pressure-broadening treatments, and include contributions from collision-induced absorption, free electrons, and scattering processes. We further provide cloudy mean opacity tables that account for cloud particle extinction across a range of particle sizes and capture the sequential removal of condensates as the gas cools. We benchmark our cloud-free tables against widely used opacity tables and find significant relative differences, exceeding 100% in Rosseland mean opacities at T \gtrsim 3000 K due to the inclusion of additional short-wavelength absorbers. Differences in Planck mean opacities at high temperatures are even larger, in some cases exceeding two orders of magnitude, which is most likely driven by the inclusion of Ca, Mg, and Fe cross-sections and updated Na D and K I resonance line treatments. Cloud opacities substantially increase Rosseland mean opacities for T \lesssim 2800 K, while their effect on Planck mean opacities is weaker. We also discuss limitations of our mean opacities at high pressures, where non-ideal effects become important. This work provides improved cloud-free mean opacity tables for giant planets, as well as the first publicly available cloudy mean opacity tables, which will enable more realistic modeling of their atmospheres and interiors.

 - **Abstract**
 Black holes (BHs) in microquasars can launch powerful relativistic jets that have the capacity to travel up to several parsecs from the compact object and interact with the interstellar medium. Recently, the detection of large-scale very-high-energy (VHE) gamma-ray emission around the black hole transient V4641 Sgr and other BH-jet systems suggested that jets from microquasars may play an important role in the production of galactic cosmic rays. V4641 Sgr is known for its superluminal radio jet discovered in 1999, but no radio counterpart of a large-scale jet has been observed. The goal of this work is to search for a radio counterpart of the extended VHE source. We observed V4641 Sgr with the MeerKAT radio telescope at the L and UHF bands and produced deep maps of the field using high dynamic range techniques. We report the discovery of a large-scale (35 pc), bow-tie-shaped, diffuse, radio structure around V4641 Sgr, with similar angular size to the extended X-ray emission discovered by XRISM. However, it is not spatially coincident with the extended VHE emission. After discussing the association of the structure with V4641 Sgr, we investigate the nature of the emission mechanism. We suggest that the bow-tie structure arose from the long-term action of large-scale jets or disk winds from V4641 Sgr. If the emission mechanism is of synchrotron origin, the radio/X-ray extended structure implies acceleration of electrons up to more than 100 TeV as far as tens of parsecs from the black hole.

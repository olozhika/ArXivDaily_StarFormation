 - **Abstract**
 Visible and ultraviolet imaging and spectroscopy of Solar System giant planets can set the paradigm for the atmospheric, ionospheric, and magnetospheric processes shaping the diversity of giant exoplanets, brown dwarfs, and their interactions with stellar hosts. Spectra of their molecular absorptions, aerosol scattering, airglow, and auroral emissions can reveal these dynamic atmospheres in three dimensions. Given that giant planets are extended, bright, moving, and rotating objects, with extreme dynamic range and highly variable appearances, they impose specific mission and instrumentation requirements on future large space-based optical/UV observatories like the proposed Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO). We advocate that HWO must have the capability to track non-sidereal targets like the giant planets and their satellites; should be able to view auroras and atmospheres without saturation (e.g., through the use of filters or fast read-out modes); and with a high dynamic range to explore faint objects near bright discs. HWO should enable spatially-resolved spectroscopy from $\sim80$ nm to $\sim900$ nm, capturing H$_2$ Lyman and Werner band series and H Lyman-$\alpha$ in the far-UV; molecular absorptions and scattering in the mid-UV/visible; and deep hydrogen/methane absorptions in the 800-900 nm for cloud characterisation and CH$_4$ mapping. Imaging should enable time-resolved observations, from seconds to create auroral movies, to hours for cloud tracking and winds, to months and years for atmosphere/ionosphere variability. We advocate that an imager should have sufficient field of view to capture Jupiter ($>50$\arcsec), and that UV/visible integral field spectrographs be considered with both narrow ($3$\arcsec) and wide ($>10$\arcsec) field capabilities to provide efficient mapping of atmospheres and auroras.

 - **Abstract**
 Giant planets are thought to build their cores beyond the snow line, where water ice solids catalyze efficient planetary core growth \citep{Pollack1996, Armitage2024}. In close binary star systems, however, the companion star's gravity shrinks the region where orbits are long-term stable \citep[]{Holman1999}, effectively excluding the zone where giants should form. Nevertheless, here we show that such systems exist and are not rare. Among 393 binary systems with measured orbits and circumstellar gas giants, we identify 19 for which the snowline region is unstable. The distribution of their metallicities and eccentricities is consistent with the background population, making a capture origin or enhanced solids abundance unlikely causes for their formation. Instead, we show that the sub-snowline formation paradox can be resolved by the tidal torque from the companion, which truncates the protoplanetary disk and creates a pressure bump and effective dust trap that facilitates the formation of gas giants. Using this model, we can successfully predict the observed locations of gas giants from their host binary properties. Moreover, the main inconsistent outliers from these predictions are found to be evolved stellar systems (white dwarfs or red-giant stars), further supporting the model and pointing to these being second-generation planets. Our results have therefore key implications for understanding planet formation processes and provide observational support for sub-snowline gas-giant formation and the role of trap-dusts in their formation.

 - **Abstract**
 The inner region of a subhalo's density distribution is particularly sensitive to dark matter microphysics, with alternative dark matter models leading to both cored and steeply-rising inner density profiles. This work investigates how the lensing signature and detectability of dark matter subhalos in mock HST-, Euclid-, and JWST-like strong lensing observations depends on the subhalo's radial density profile, especially with regards to the inner power-law slope, $\beta$. We demonstrate that the minimum-mass subhalo detectable along the Einstein ring of a system is strongly dependent on $\beta$. In particular, we show that subhalos with $\beta \sim 2.2$ can be detected down to masses over an order-of-magnitude lower than their Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) counterparts with $\beta \sim 1$. Importantly, we find that the detectability of subhalos with steep inner profiles is minimally affected by increasing the complexity of the main lens galaxy's mass model. This is a unique characteristic of these subhalos, as those with NFW or shallower profiles become essentially undetectable when multipole perturbations are added to the lens model. The results of this work highlight how the underlying dark matter physics can significantly impact the expected number of subhalo detections from strong gravitational lensing observations. This is important for testing Cold Dark Matter against alternatives, such as Self-Interacting Dark Matter, which predict the existence of subhalos with diverse inner density profiles.

 - **Abstract**
 Many white dwarfs have accreted material from their own planetary systems. These objects can be used to infer the composition of exoplanetary material and identify evidence for key geological processes. However, the white dwarf atmospheric physics distorts the inferred material composition away from the true composition, mainly through differential atomic diffusion of the accreted metals. Correcting for this effect is essential, but is dependent on various physical assumptions associated with the white dwarf itself. We first focus on the effect of assumptions related to convective overshoot and thermohaline mixing on the atomic diffusion timescales. For white dwarfs with H-dominated atmospheres between 12000 K and 18000 K, we find that including a complete treatment of convective overshoot decreases the inferred Fe and O abundances in accreted material. For these white dwarfs, we also find that including thermohaline mixing decreases Fe and O abundances. For He-dominated systems, the effect of convective overshoot is comparatively minor. We then explore the overall effect of other physical assumptions by comparing publicly available grids of diffusion timescales. We find that the choice of model grid can have a large impact for white dwarfs with He-dominated atmospheres, notably on the inferred core to mantle ratio of accreted material. We identify several systems for which the geological interpretation is robust against these systematics. We also present a `discrepancy metric' which can be used to estimate the potential impact of changing the stellar physics without requiring detailed modelling.
#### Piling up in the darkness: Features of the BBH mass distribution from isolated binaries

 - **Abstract**
 After the third LIGO--Virgo--KAGRA observing run, the number of detected binary black hole (BBH) mergers became sufficient to identify statistical features of the population. We explore how different prescriptions for the final fate of massive stars and key binary-evolution processes shape isolated binaries and their remnants. Using \textsc{sevn}, we evolved $10^{7}$ binaries across 15 metallicities, 3 core-collapse supernova models, 4 PPISN models, and 6 common-envelope (CE) prescriptions, for a total of 990 runs ($9.9 \times 10^{9}$ systems). Both single- and binary-star physics shape the BH mass distribution: single-star processes control the high-mass tail ($M_{\rm BH} \geq 45M_{\odot}$), while binary evolution produces pile-ups in specific intervals. In particular, the bump at $\sim 35 M_{\odot}$, often attributed to PPISNe, also emerges from binaries evolving only through stable mass transfer, without CE. Finally, we test a top-heavy IMF, finding it boosts merger numbers and alters the abundance of systems with a given primary BH mass.
#### Discovery of Powerful Multi-Velocity Ultra-Fast Outflows in the Starburst Merger Galaxy IRAS 05189$-$2524 with XRISM

 - **Abstract**
 We observed the X-ray-bright ultra-luminous infrared galaxy, IRAS 05189$-$2524, with XRISM during its performance verification phase. The unprecedented energy resolution of the onboard X-ray microcalorimeter revealed complex spectral features at $\sim$7$-$9 keV, which can be interpreted as blueshifted Fe XXV/XXVI absorption lines with various velocity dispersions, originating from ultra-fast outflow (UFO) components with multiple bulk velocities of $\sim0.076c$, $\sim0.101c$, and $\sim0.143c$. In addition, a broad Fe-K emission line was detected around $\sim7$ keV, forming a P Cygni profile together with the absorption lines. The onboard X-ray CCD camera revealed a 0.4$-$12 keV broadband spectrum characterized by a neutrally absorbed power-law continuum with a photon index of $\sim2.3$, and intrinsic flare-like variability on timescales of $\sim10$ ksec, both of which are likely associated with near-Eddington accretion. We also found potential variability of the UFO parameters on a timescale of $\sim140$ ksec. Using these properties, we propose new constraints on the outflow structure and suggest the presence of multiple outflowing regions on scales of about tens to a hundred Schwarzschild radii, located within roughly two thousand Schwarzschild radii. Since both the estimated momentum and energy outflow rates of the UFOs exceed those of galactic molecular outflows, our results indicate that powerful, multi-velocity UFOs are already well developed during a short-lived evolutionary phase following a major galaxy merger, characterized by intense starburst activity and likely preceding the quasar phase. This system is expected to evolve into a quasar, sustaining strong UFO activity and suppressing star formation in the host galaxy.
#### 4 Second and 169 Second Rotation of Two Isolated, Ultramassive, Strongly Magnetic White Dwarfs

 - **Abstract**
 Photometric variability in massive, magnetic white dwarfs (WDs) on the timescales of less than a few hours is oft interpreted as being due to magnetic spots on the surface of a rotating star. Increasingly, numbers of these short period variables are being discovered with the continued growth of time-domain astronomy, testing theories of magnetic white dwarf formation and angular momentum evolution. We present the detection of extremely rapid rotation in the WDs SDSS J1557+0411 and PG 1312+099, with periods of 168.94 s and 83.72 s, respectively. We consider other possible causes of the monoperiodic photometric variability, including binarity (eclipses and ellipsoidal variations) and asteroseismic pulsations. Though these cannot be ruled out with the existing data, these alternative explanations seem unlikely. SDSS J1557+0411 was predicted to be a rapidly rotating oxygen-neon core WD by Camisassa et al. (2022), a prediction borne out at least in part by our observations. PG 1312+099 was previously observed via polarimetry to be rotating with a period of ~5.4 h; we propose that this object may be an unresolved double degenerate system.
#### Clouds as the driver of variability and colour changes in brown dwarf atmospheres

 - **Abstract**
 Brown dwarfs are massive, giant exoplanet analogues subject to variability and colour changes, known as the L/T transition, fundamental for their thermal evolution. The drivers of the L/T transition remain elusive, with atmospheric circulations and/or clouds usually suggested as potential mechanisms. Using a three-dimensional Global Climate Model including cloud formation, transport and multi-wavelength radiative effects, we show that clouds play a major role in shaping the atmospheric properties of brown dwarfs. Cloud radiative effect, which triggers atmospheric convection, leads to spectral, spatial, and temporal variability in the modelled brown dwarfs, in agreement with the observed variability and L/T transition. Low latitudes are subject to sustained wave activity, whereas eddies dominate higher latitudes. Our results highlight that the role of clouds as a driver of atmospheric dynamics and climate, well known for giant exoplanets, extends to all sub-stellar bodies.

 - **Abstract**
 A clear definition of the contribution from the slow neutron-capture process (s process) to the solar abundances between Fe and the Sr-Zr region is a crucial challenge for nuclear astrophysics. Robust s-process predictions are necessary to disentangle the contribution from other stellar processes producing elements in the same mass region. Nuclear uncertainties are affecting s-process calculations, but most of the needed nuclear input are accessible to present nuclear experiments or they will be in the near future. Neutron-capture rates have a great impact on the s process in massive stars, which is a fundamental source for the solar abundances of the lighter s-process elements heavier than Fe (weak s-process component). In this work we present a new nuclear sensitivity study to explore the impact on the s process in massive stars of 86 neutron-capture rates, including all the reactions between C and Si and between Fe and Zr. We derive the impact of the rates at the end of the He-burning core and at the end of the C-burning shell, where the $^{22}$Ne($\alpha$,n)$^{25}$Mg reaction is is the main neutron source. We confirm the relevance of the light isotopes capturing neutrons in competition with the Fe seeds as a crucial feature of the s process in massive stars. For heavy isotopes we study the propagation of the neutron-capture uncertainties, finding a clear difference of the impact of Fe and Co isotope rates with respect to the rates of heavier stable isotopes. The local uncertainty propagation due to the neutron-capture rates at the s-process branching points is also considered, discussing the example of $^{85}$Kr. The complete results of our study for all the 86 neutron-capture rates are available online. Finally, we present the impact on the weak s process of the neutron-capture rates included in the new ASTRAL library (v0.2).
#### Disentangling Thermal and Abundance Characteristics in a Solar Flare Using SDO/AIA, Hinode/XRT, and MinXSS-1 Observations

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the thermal properties of a solar flare by the observations of soft X-ray Telescope (XRT) on board Hinode and the Atmospheric Image Assembly on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO/AIA). Our analysis reveals a tenuous but hot plasma cloud located above the flare loops. The flare loops and plasma cloud exhibit independent temperature profiles as a function of time, implying different heating mechanisms are present in these structures. We interpret the plasma cloud as an eruptive filament directly heated in the corona via magnetic reconnection that occurs when a rising filament interacts with this eruptive filament. Previous disk-integrated solar soft X-ray spectral measurements of this flare using the Miniature X-ray Solar Spectrometer CubeSat-1 (MinXSS-1) inferred coronal abundances at the flare peak. However, MinXSS synthetic spectra from AIA observations show that the plasma cloud is too tenuous to be detected in MinXSS-1 and thus the coronal abundances of low FIP elements must be in emission from the flare loops. Furthermore, we demonstrate the non-negligible differences in differential emission measures (DEMs) between coronal and photospheric abundance models. These results highlight the importance of instruments capable of simultaneous spectral and spatial diagnostics during large-scale solar events. Such coordinated measurements would enable more accurate thermal and compositional analyses and deeper insight into the underlying physical mechanisms.
#### SKYSURF-11: A New Zodiacal Light Model Optimized for Optical Wavelengths

 - **Abstract**
 We present an improved zodiacal light model, optimized for optical wavelengths, using archival Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging from the SKYSURF program. The Kelsall et. al. 1998 model used infrared imaging from the Diffuse Infrared Background Experiment (DIRBE) on board the Cosmic Background Explorer to create a 3D structure of the interplanetary dust cloud. However, this model cannot accurately represent zodiacal light emission outside of DIRBE's nominal wavelength bandpasses, the bluest of which is 1.25 micron. We present a revision to this model (called ZodiSURF) that incorporates analytical forms of both the scattering phase function and albedo as a function of wavelength, which are empirically determined across optical wavelengths (0.3-1.6 micron) from over 5,000 HST sky surface brightness (sky-SB) measurements. This refined model results in significantly improved predictions of zodiacal light emission at these wavelengths and for Sun angles greater than 80 deg. Fits to HST data show an uncertainty in the model of ~4.5%. Remarkably, the HST sky-SB measurements show an excess of residual diffuse light (HST Sky - ZodiSURF - Diffuse Galactic Light) of 0.013 +/- 0.006 MJy/sr. The blue color of our diffuse light signal makes it unlikely to be of extragalactic origin. Instead, we suggest that a very dim spherical dust cloud may need to be included in the zodiacal light model, which we present here as a toy model.
#### On the consistency of jet feedback modelling across different astrophysics hydrodynamical codes

 - **Abstract**
 Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) feedback is essential in cosmological simulations of galaxy formation, yet its implementation has to rely on subgrid models due to limited resolution. We present a novel subgrid jet-launching method for galaxy formation simulations and implement it in three hydrodynamical codes: the smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) code SWIFT, the moving-mesh code AREPO, and the Eulerian grid code PLUTO. To isolate the impact of hydrodynamical solvers on jet evolution, we compare idealised jets and their remnants in uniform and stratified media across resolutions and jet parameters. In uniform media, all jets drive bow shocks, inflate hot lobes, exhibit backflows, and evolve self-similarly. For the parameters explored, SWIFT lobes are shorter, wider, and hotter; AREPO lobes are longer, thinner, and cooler; while PLUTO lobes display complex flows with intermediate characteristics. In stratified media, jets deviate from self-similar evolution, inflating longer and thinner lobes due to lower external ram pressure. After switch-off, SWIFT jets evolve into smooth cylindrical bubbles, AREPO jets produce long filamentary remnants, and PLUTO jets yield intermediate-length remnants with varying degrees of mixing. Despite such differences, all jets and remnants have a similar impact on the ambient medium. We conclude that variations in lobe properties between codes emerge even for identical subgrid prescriptions, since the coupling of jet feedback to resolvable scales and the effective resolution depend on the hydrodynamical method. In structure formation simulations, these solver differences are likely subdominant to uncertainties in subgrid modelling and calibration, while averaging over galaxy populations may lessen their impact.
#### Comparative Statistical Analysis of Prompt and Afterglow X-Ray Flares in Gamma-Ray Bursts: Insights into Extended Central Engine Activity

 - **Abstract**
 Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are the most energetic phenomena in the Universe, characterized by prompt gamma-ray emission followed by multiwavelength afterglows. X-ray flares, observed during the afterglow phase, are generally believed to originate from the prolonged activity of the central engine, though direct evidence has been scarce. In this study, we present a comprehensive statistical analysis of X-ray flares from 315 GRBs observed by the Swift/X-ray Telescope over nearly two decades. We categorize flares into prompt flares (occurring during the prompt emission phase) and afterglow flares and compare their temporal and luminosity properties. Our analysis reveals that both types of flares exhibit similar morphological characteristics, with prompt flares being brighter and occurring earlier than afterglow flares. We find strong correlations between flare parameters, such as peak time, duration, and luminosity, which follow consistent patterns across both flare types. These findings suggest that X-ray flares, regardless of their timing, share a common origin in the central engine's activity. Our results imply that the central engine's activity duration extends beyond the prompt gamma-ray emission phase, highlighting the importance of considering X-ray flares when studying GRB progenitors and central engine properties. This work provides robust statistical evidence supporting the central engine origin of X-ray flares and underscores the need for future observations with missions like the Space-based multi-band astronomical Variable Objects Monitor and Einstein Probe to further elucidate the nature of GRB central engines.
#### Head-tail molecular clouds falling onto the Milky Way disk

 - **Abstract**
 We report discovery of two CO clouds which are likely falling down to the Galactic plane at more than $35$ km s$^{-1}$. The clouds show head-tail distributions elongated perpendicular to the Galactic plane at $l=331.6^{\circ}$ and $b=0^{\circ}$ as revealed by an analysis of the Mopra CO $J=$1-0 survey data. We derived the distance of the clouds to be $2.46 \pm 0.18$ kpc based on the Gaia Data Release 3. The CO clouds have molecular masses of $4.8\times 10^3\ M_{\odot}$ and $3.5\times 10^3\ M_{\odot}$, respectively, and show kinetic temperature of 30-50 K as derived from the line intensities of the $^{13}$CO $J$=2-1, $^{12}$CO $J$=1-0, and $^{13}$CO $J$=1-0 emission. The temperature in the heads of the clouds is significantly higher than 10 K of the typical molecular clouds, although no radiative heat source is found inside or close to the clouds. Based on the results, we interpret that the present clouds are falling onto the Milky Way disk and are significantly heated up by the strong shock interaction with the disk HI gas. We suggest that the clouds represent part of the HI intermediate velocity clouds falling to the Galactic plane which were converted into molecular clouds by shock compression. This is the first case of falling CO clouds having direct observed signatures of the falling motion including clear directivity and shock heating. Possible implications of the CO clouds in the evolution of the Galactic interstellar medium are discussed.
#### Unveiling the nature of HE 0107-5240

 - **Abstract**
 The vast majority of the most iron-poor stars in the Galaxy exhibit a strong carbon enhancement, with C/H ratios only about two orders of magnitude below solar. This unusual chemical composition likely reflects the properties of the gas cloud from which these stars formed, having been enriched by one, or at most a few, supernovae. A remarkable member of this stellar class, HE 0107-5240 with [Fe/H]=-5.56, has been identified as part of a binary system. To constrain its orbital parameters, radial velocity monitoring has been carried out using the ESPRESSO spectrograph. Radial velocities were derived using cross-correlation with a template, taking advantage of the strong G-band feature. Combining all observations yielded a high signal-to-noise spectrum, which has been used to refine our understanding of the stellar chemical composition. Additionally, a co-added UVES spectrum in the blue was used to complement the wavelength coverage of ESPRESSO. Observations of HE 0107-5240 over a span of more than four years have yielded a revised orbital period of about 29 years. Updated elemental abundances have been determined for Sc, Cr, Co, and, tentatively, Al, along with a new upper limit for Be. The iron abundance has been derived from ionised Fe lines. Significant upper limits have been established for Li, Si, and Sr. The star is confirmed to be a long-period binary. Iron abundances derived from neutral and ionised lines are consistent with local thermodynamical equilibrium (LTE) assumption, casting doubt on published deviation from LTE corrections for Fe for this star. The heavy elements Sr and Ba remain undetected, confirming the classification of HE 0107-5240 as a carbon enhanced metal-poor and non enhanced in heavy elements (CEMP-no) star and supporting the absence of an n-capture element plateau at the lowest metallicities.
#### Diurnal temperature variations and migrating thermal tides in the Martian lower atmosphere observed by the Emirates Mars InfraRed Spectrometer

 - **Abstract**
 The Martian atmosphere experiences large diurnal variations due to the ~24.6 h planetary rotation and its low heat capacity. Understanding such variations on a planetary scale is limited due to the lack of observations, which are greatly addressed with the recent advent of the Emirates Mars Mission (EMM). As a result of its unique high-altitude orbit, instruments onboard are capable of obtaining a full geographic and local time coverage of the Martian atmosphere every 9-10 Martian days, approximately ~5° in solar longitude (LS). This enables investigations of the diurnal variation of the current climate on Mars on a planetary scale without significant local time (LT) gaps or confusions from correlated seasonal variations. Here, we present the results of diurnal temperature variations and thermal tides in the Martian atmosphere using temperature profiles retrieved from the Emirates Mars InfraRed Spectrometer (EMIRS) observations. The data during the primary mission is included, covering an entire Martian Year (MY) starting from MY 36 LS = 49°. The diurnal temperature patterns suggest a dominant diurnal tide in most seasons, while the semi-diurnal tide presents a similar amplitude near perihelion. The seasonal variation of the diurnal tide latitudinal distribution is well explained by the total vorticity due to zonal wind, while that of the semi-diurnal tide following both dust and water ice clouds, and the ter-diurnal tide following the dust only. Comparison with the updated Mars Planetary Climate Model (PCM, version 6) suggest improvements in simulating the dust and water cycles, as well as their radiative processes.

 - **Abstract**
 TRAPPIST-1 e is one of a few habitable zone exoplanets that is amenable to characterization in the near term. In this study our motivations are both scientific and technical. Our technical goal is to establish a multimodel sparse sampled ensemble approach for coherently exploring large unconstrained parameter spaces typical in exoplanet science. Our science goal is to determine relationships that connect observations to the underlying climate across a large parameter space of atmospheric compositions for TRAPPIST-1 e. We consider atmospheric compositions of N2, CO2, CH4, and H2O, with water clouds and photochemical hazes. We use a 1D photochemical model, a 3D climate model, and a transmission spectral model, filtered through a quasi-Monte Carlo sparse sampling approach applied across atmospheric compositions. While clouds and hazes have significant effects on the transmission spectra, CO2 and CH4 can be potentially detected in <10 transits for certain compositional and climate states. Colder climates have better prospects for characterization, due to being relatively dry and having fewer clouds, permitting transmission observations to probe more deeply into their atmospheres. CH4 volume mixing ratios of >$10^{-3}$ trigger strong antigreenhouse cooling, where near-IR absorption simultaneously creates an inversion in the stratosphere and reduces the stellar radiation reaching the planet surface. In such cases, interpreting the disk-averaged emission and albedo at face value can yield misleading conclusions, as here low albedo and high thermal emission are associated with cold planets. Future work will use our sparse sampling approach to explore broader parameter spaces and other observationally amenable exoplanets.

 - **Abstract**
 Numerous astrophysical shock waves evolve in an environment where the radiative cooling behind the shock affects the hydrodynamical structure downstream, thereby influencing the potential for particle acceleration via diffusive shock acceleration (DSA). We study the possibility for DSA to energize particles from the thermal pool and from pre-existing cosmic rays at radiative shocks, focusing on the case of supernova remnants (SNRs). We rely on a semi-analytical description of particle acceleration at collisionless shocks in the test-particle limit, estimating the total proton and electron content from SNRs throughout the radiative phase. Our results indicate that DSA can lead to significant particle acceleration during the first few tens of kyrs of the radiative phase. Although the associated multi-wavelength emission from SNRs in the radiative phase may not be detectable with current observatories in most cases, the radiative phase is found to lead to substantial deviations from the canonical p$^{-4}$ of the test-particle limit. The hardening/steepening is due to an interplay between a growing contribution of the reaccelerated term as the SNR volume expands and the effects of adiabatic and radiative losses on trapped particles as particles are confined for a longer time. The slope of the cumulative proton and electron spectra over the SNR lifetime thus depends on the environment in which the SNR shock propagates, and on the duration of the radiative phase during which DSA can take place. Overall, DSA in the radiative phase can lead to a total electron spectrum steeper than the proton spectrum, both at SNRs from thermonuclear and core-collapse SNe. Finally, we comment on the case of young radiative SNRs (in the first month to a few years after the explosion) for which the denser environments (with mass-loss rates of $\dot{M} \sim 10^{-1} - 1$ M$_{\odot}$/yr) tend to inhibit DSA.

 - **Abstract**
 Examining the photospheric time evolution of the core-collapse supernova (CCSN) SN 2023ixf from the literature, we identify three evolutionary time periods with constant expansion velocities, which we attribute to three ejecta shells. We find that several CCSN remnants have morphologies with two or more complete or partial shells, compatible with the presence of two or three photospheric shells during the photospheric phase of the explosion. Studies have attributed these CCSN remnants to the jittering-jet explosion mechanism (JJEM), which involves two or three energetic pairs of jets participating in the explosion. We, therefore, conclude that the structure of the photospheric shells of SN 2023ixf supports its explosion by the JJEM. This study adds to the accumulating evidence that the JJEM is the primary explosion mechanism of CCSNE.

 - **Abstract**
 Type Ia supernovae (SNe) are believed to be thermonuclear explosions of white dwarf (WD) stars, but their progenitor systems and explosion mechanisms are still unclear. Here we focus on double degenerate systems, where two WDs are interacting, and on the double detonation mechanism, where a detonation of a helium shell triggers a detonation of the carbon-oxygen core of the primary WD. We take the results from three-dimensional SN simulations of Pakmor et al 2022 (arXiv:2203.14990) and carry them into the supernova remnant (SNR) phase, until 1500 yr after the explosion. We reveal signatures of the SN imprinted in the SNR morphology. We confirm the impact of a companion on the SNR: its presence induces a conical shadow in the ejecta, that is long lived. Its intersection with the shocked shell is visible in projection as a ring, an ellipse, or a bar, depending on the orientation. New, we test the case of a nested explosion model, in which the explosion of the primary induces the secondary to also explode. As the explosion of the secondary WD is weaker only the primary outer ejecta interact with the ambient medium and form the main SNR shell. The secondary inner ejecta collide with the reverse shock, which enhances the density and thus the X-ray emissivity. The composition at the points of impact is peculiar, since what is revealed are the outer layers from the inner ejecta. This effect can be probed with spatially-resolved X-ray spectroscopy of young SNRs.

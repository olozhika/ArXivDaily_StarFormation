 - **Abstract**
 Star formation from metal-free gas, the hallmark of the first generation of Population III stars, was long assumed to occur in the very early Universe. We report the discovery of MPG-CR3 (Metal-Pristine Galaxy COSMOS Redshift 3; hereafter CR3), an extremely metal-poor galaxy at redshift $z= 3.193\pm0.016$. From JWST, VLT, and Subaru observations, CR3 exhibits exceptionally strong Ly$\alpha$, H$\alpha$, and He I $\lambda$10830 emission. We measure rest-frame equivalent widths of EW$_0$(Ly$\alpha$) $\approx822$ Angstrom and EW$_0$(H$\alpha$) $\approx2814$ Angstrom, among the highest seen in star-forming systems. No metal lines, e.g. [O III] $\lambda\lambda4959,5007$, C IV $\lambda\lambda1548,1550$, are currently detected at statistically significant level, placing a 2-$\sigma$ abundance upper limit of 12+log(O/H) < 6.52 ($Z < 8\times10^{-3}\ Z_\odot$). The observed Ly$\alpha$/H$\alpha$ flux ratio is $\approx13.9$, indicating negligible dust attenuation. Spectral energy distribution modeling with Pop III stellar templates indicates a very young ($\sim2$ Myr), low-mass ($M_* \approx 6.1\times 10^5 M_\odot$) stellar population. Further, the photometric redshifts reveal that CR3 could reside in a slightly underdense environment ($\delta \approx -0.12$). CR3 provides evidence that first-generation star formation could persist well after the epoch of reionization, challenging the conventional view that pristine star formation ended by $z\gtrsim6$.

 - **Abstract**
 Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) are the strongest explosions in the Universe, and are powered by initially ultra-relativistic jets. The angular profile of GRB jets encodes important information about their launching and propagation near the central source, and can be probed through their afterglow emission. Detailed analysis of the multi-wavelength afterglow light curves of recent GRBs indeed shows evidence for an extended angular structure beyond the jet's narrow core. The afterglow emission is determined by the jet angular structure, our viewing angle, and the magnetic field structure behind the shock, often leading to degeneracies when considering the light curves and broad-band spectrum alone. Such degeneracies can be lifted with joint modeling of the afterglow light curves and polarization. In this work we study the evolution of the afterglow linear polarization and flux density from steep, core-dominated GRB jets, where most of their energy resides within a narrow core. We explore the dependence of the light and polarization curves on the viewing angle, jet angular energy structure and magnetic field configuration, and provide an analytical approximation for the peak polarization level, which occurs at a time close to that of a break in the light curve. Finally, we demonstrate how our results can be used to determine the nature of orphan GRB afterglows, distinguishing between a quasi-spherical "dirty fireball" and a steep jets viewed far off-axis and apply them on the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) detected orphan afterglow candidate AT2021lfa.

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmic strings appear in many well-motivated extensions to the standard model of particle physics. If they exist, an abundant population of compact objects known as cosmic string loops permeate the Universe at all times, providing a secondary source of density perturbations that are large amplitude and non-gaussian in nature. In general, these loops are not stationary in the rest frame of the dark matter, thus their relative velocities will typically seed both spherical and filamentary overdensities in the matter era. Building upon previous work, we provide an improved framework to compute the complete halo mass function for these string seeded overdensities, valid for any loop velocity distribution. Using this mass function, we also compute the subset of halos capable of undergoing a direct collapse, forming a population of black holes with initial mass $10^{4-5} \, M_{\odot}$ at high redshifts. Interestingly, for reasonable values of the string parameters, one can reproduce the abundance of ``Little Red Dots" as inferred by JWST.
#### Collapsar Disk Outflows III: Detectable Neutrino and Gravitational Wave Signatures

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.17836

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the neutrino and gravitational wave (GW) signals from accretion disks formed during the failed collapse of a rotating massive star (a collapsar). Following black hole formation, a neutrino-cooled, shocked accretion disk forms, which displays non-spherical oscillations for a period of seconds before becoming advective and exploding the star. We compute the neutrino and GW signals (matter quadrupole) from collapsar disks using global axisymmetric, viscous hydrodynamic simulations. The neutrino signal with typical energies of O$(10)$ MeV is maximal during the neutrino-cooled (NDAF) phase that follows shock formation. This phase lasts for a few seconds and is easily detectable within O$(10-100)$ kpc by the IceCube Neutrino Telescope. Additional neutrino signatures from a precursor equatorial shock and by stochastic accretion plumes during the advective phase are detectable within the galaxy. The GW signal during the NDAF phase is detectable in the galaxy by current and next-generation ground-based observatories. The explosion (memory) GW signal is similar to that of standard core-collapse supernovae and can be probed with a deci-Hertz space-based detector. Shock oscillations during the NDAF phase impart time variations with frequency O$(10-100)$ Hz to the neutrino and GW signals, encoding information about the shock dynamics and inner disk. These time variations can be detectable in neutrinos by IceCube within O$(1-10)$ kpc depending on progenitor model, flavor transformation scenario, and detailed properties of the angular momentum transport mechanism.
#### On the incidence of weak and strong Mg II absorbers towards the Flat and Steep Spectrum Radio quasars

 - **Abstract**
 The incidence rate of Mg II absorbers per unit redshift path (dN/dz) towards quasar sightlines has been used to probe the interaction between quasar jets and surrounding gas clouds. Studies using core- and lobe-dominated samples found a higher dN/dz for strong Mg II absorbers (rest equivalent width, W_r(2796) >= 1.0 A) in velocity offsets ranging from 5000 km/s < beta * c < 60000 km/s (with beta = v/c), toward core-dominated sources. In this study, we applied a stringent spectral index criterion: alpha_radio < -0.7 for steep-spectrum radio quasars (SSRQs) and alpha_radio > -0.3 for flat-spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs). Using this, we assembled the largest sample to date: 441 FSRQs and 464 SSRQs with suitable optical spectra to study both strong absorbers and weak (0.3 A < W_r(2796) < 1.0 A) Mg II absorbers. We conducted a detailed comparison of absorbers' incidence rate and offset velocity distributions. Our main findings are: (i) For both weak and strong absorbers, we found no significant excess in dN/dz towards FSRQ compared to SSRQ sightlines. (ii) The dN/dbeta distribution of Mg II absorbers along FSRQs and SSRQs are statistically similar. (iii) The cumulative distribution of weak Mg II absorbers is slightly lower for beta < 0.3, but shows an excess at higher beta. This suggests that, while intrinsic Mg II absorber abundance is comparable along both sightlines, FSRQs' more aligned relativistic jets cluster weak absorbers at high beta, consistent with the scenario of jet-driven acceleration of smaller gas clumps.
#### The Ejecta Nebula Around the Wolf-Rayet Star WR 71

 - **Abstract**
 We present deep H$\alpha$ and [O III] images of the ejecta rich nebulosity associated with the suspected runaway and binary Wolf-Rayet star WR~71 (HD 143414). In H$\alpha$ emission, the nebula appears as a crescent shaped, broken ring of clumpy emission some $9' \times 13'$ in angular size centered to the south and west of the WR star. At a Gaia estimated distance of 4.27 kpc, the nebula has physical dimensions of $11 \times 16$ pc making it one of the larger known ejecta rich WR ring nebulae. Our [O III] image also show considerable surrounding faint nebulosity much of which may be unrelated to the WR star. A comparison of the nebula's optical appearance with that seen in WISE 22 $\mu$m data shows infrared coincidence with the nebula's brightest [O III] emission features. Deep H$\alpha$ and [O III] images like those presented here suggests that new and substantially deeper imaging reconnaissance of WR star nebulae compared to earlier surveys may lead to additional WR ring nebula detections, thereby enhancing our understanding on the frequency and formation of WR ring nebulae.

 - **Abstract**
 Although interstellar dust extinction serves as a powerful distance estimator, the solar system's location within the Galactic plane complicates distance determinations, especially for molecular clouds (MCs) at varying distances along the line of sight (LoS). The presence of complex extinction patterns along LoS introduces degeneracies, resulting in less accurate distance measurements to overlapping MCs in crowded regions of the Galactic plane. In this study, we develop the CUSUM-based Jump-point Analysis for Distance Estimation (CU-JADE), a novel method designed to help mitigate these observational challenges. The key strengths of CU-JADE include: (1) sensitivity to detect abrupt jumps in $Distance$-$A_{\lambda}$ ($D$-$A$) datasets, (2) minimal systematic errors as demonstrated on both mock and observed data, and (3) the ability to combine CUSUM analysis with multi-wavelength data to improve the completeness of distance measurements for nearby gas structures, even for extinction values as low as $\Delta A_{V} \gtrsim 0.15$ mag. By combining CO survey data with a large sample of stars characterized by high-precision parallaxes and extinctions, we uncovered the multi-layered molecular gas distribution in the high-latitude Cepheus region. We also determined accurate distances to MCs beyond the Cygnus Rift by analyzing the intricate structure of gas and extinction within the Galactic plane. Additionally, we constructed a full-sky 3D extinction map extending to 4 kpc, which provides critical insights into dense interstellar medium components dominated by molecular hydrogen. These results advance our understanding of the spatial distribution and physical properties of MCs across the Milky Way.

 - **Abstract**
 We aim to construct a comprehensive global multi-scale kinematic equilibrium radiative-transfer model for the pre-transitional disc of DoAr 44 (Haro 1-16, V2062 Oph) in the Ophiuchus star-forming region. This model integrates diverse observational datasets to describe the system, spanning from the accretion region to the outer disc. Our analysis utilises a large set of observational data, including ALMA continuum complex visibilities, VLTI/GRAVITY continuum squared visibilities, closure phases, and triple products, as well as VLT/UVES and VLT/X-shooter H-alpha spectra. Additionally, we incorporated absolute flux measurements from ground-based optical observatories, Spitzer, IRAS, the Submillimeter Array, the IRAM, or the ATCA radio telescopes. These data sets were used to constrain the structure and kinematics of the object through radiative-transfer modelling. Our model reveals that the spectral line profiles are best explained by an optically thin spherical inflow/outflow within the co-rotation radius of the star, exhibiting velocities exceeding 380 km/s. The VLTI near-infrared interferometric observations are consistent with an inner disc extending from 0.1 to 0.2 au. The ALMA sub-millimetre observations indicate a dust ring located between 36 and 56 au, probably related to the CO2 condensation line. The global density and temperature profiles derived from our model provide insight into an intermediate disc, located in the terrestrial planet-forming zone, which has not yet been spatially resolved.
#### The Response of Planetary Atmospheres to the Impact of Icy Comets II: exo-Earth Analogues

 - **Abstract**
 The orbital regime of a terrestrial planet plays a significant role in shaping its atmospheric dynamics, climate, and hence potential habitability. The orbit is also likely to play a role in shaping the response of a planetary atmosphere to the influx of material from an icy cometary impact. To investigate this response, we model the impact of an icy cometary body with an Earth-analogue exoplanet (i.e. an Earth-like planet orbiting a Sun-like star with a diurnal cycle) using a cometary impact and breakup model coupled with the 3D Earth-System-Model WACCM6/CESM2. To quantify the role that the atmospheric dynamics play in setting the response to a cometary impact, we compare our results with a previous study investigating an impact with a tidally-locked terrestrial exoplanet. We find that the circulation regime of the planet plays a key role in shaping the response of the atmosphere to an icy cometary impact. The weak, multi-celled circulation structure that forms on Earth-like planets is efficient at mixing material horizontally but not vertically, limiting the transport of water from the deep break-up site to higher altitudes. In turn, this limits the rate of water photodissociation at low pressures, reducing the magnitude of post-impact changes to composition. It also reduces the potential observability of an impact due to weakened cloud ice formation, and hence scattering, at low pressures. Despite this, small changes to the overall composition of the planet persist to quasi-steady-state, reinforcing the idea that ongoing bombardment may help to shape the composition/habitability of terrestrial worlds.

 - **Abstract**
 Polar mesospheric clouds provide clues to physicochemical processes in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere. However, the heterogeneous nucleation and growth processes of water ice under polar mesospheric conditions are poorly understood, especially at the nanoscale. This study used reflection high energy electron diffraction and infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy to analyze the structure of vapor-deposited ice at polar mesospheric temperature (120 K) under vapor pressure conditions. The ice appeared to grow in three steps during vapor deposition, being amorphous water for the first 15 nm, then cubic ice up to 50 nm, and finally hexagonal ice subsequently. This three step growth suggests that the three observed phases can coexist in polar mesospheric clouds, depending on the thickness of water ice. The finding of the three-step growth also shows that the Ostwald rule of stages can hold for vapor deposited ice at low temperature.
#### An S-shaped filament formed due to Cloud-Cloud Collision in molecular cloud G178.28-00.61

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.18547

 - **Abstract**
 We present compelling observational evidence supporting G178.28-00.61 as an early-stage candidate for Cloud-Cloud Collision (CCC), with indications of the formation of an S-shaped filament, evenly-separated dense cores, and young star clusters. The observations of CO molecular line emission demonstrate the existence of two interacting molecular clouds with systemic velocities of 0.8 km/s and -1.2 km/s, respectively. The convergence zone of these two clouds reveals an S-shaped filament in the JCMT 850 micron continuum image, suggesting cloud interaction. In line with expectations from CCC simulations, broad bridging features are discernible in the position-velocity diagrams. An elevated concentration of identified Class I and II young stellar objects along the filament at the intersection area further supports the hypothesis of a collision-induced origin. This observation could be explained by a recent MHD model of CCC (Kong et al. 2024), which predicts a similar morphology, scale, density, and unbound status, as well as the orientation of the polarization.

 - **Abstract**
 Although the annihilation of positrons towards the Galactic centre was established more than 50 years ago through the detection of a 511 keV gamma-ray line, the origin of the positrons remains unknown. The gamma-ray line should be accompanied by continuum emission from positron in-flight annihilation, which has not until now been detected. We aim to detect positron in-flight annihilation emission as it provides information on the kinetic energy of the positrons that is key in determining the origin of Galactic positrons. We analysed archival data obtained by the COMPTEL instrument on the Compton Gamma-Ray Observatory satellite to search for positron in-flight annihilation emission at MeV energies. Our analysis revealed extended MeV emission towards the bulge of the Galaxy, which we attribute to in-flight annihilation of positrons produced with kinetic energies of $\sim2$ MeV. The observed spectrum suggests that positrons are produced quasi mono-energetically, which could occur by the annihilation of dark matter particles with masses of $\sim3$ MeV or through bulk motion in the jet of the microquasar 1E 1740.7-2942. We furthermore detected a point-like MeV emission component towards the Galactic centre that is the plausible low-energy counterpart of the Fermi/LAT source 4FGL J1745.6-2859. The broad band spectrum of the source may be explained by the injection of pair plasma from the supermassive black hole Sgr A* into the interstellar medium, which would also explain the point-like 511 keV line emission component that was discovered by INTEGRAL/SPI at the Galactic centre. The observed positron in-flight annihilation spectrum towards the Galactic bulge excludes $\beta^+$ decays from radioactivities as well as any mechanism producing highly relativistic positrons as origin of the Galactic bulge positrons.

 - **Abstract**
 Aims: In this work, we aim to confirm the high albedo of the benchmark ultrahot Neptune LTT9779b using 20 secondary eclipse measurements of the planet observed with CHEOPS. In addition, we perform a search for variability in the reflected light intensity of the planet as a function of time. Methods: First, we used the TESS follow-up data of LTT9779b from three sectors (2, 29, and 69) to remodel the transit signature and estimate an updated set of transit and ephemeris parameters, which were directly used in the modeling of the secondary eclipse lightcurves. This involved a critical noise-treatment algorithm, including sophisticated techniques such as wavelet denoising and Gaussian Process (GP) regression, to constrain noise levels from various sources. In addition to using the officially released reduced aperture photometry data from CHEOPS DRP, we also reduced the raw data using an independent PSF photometry pipeline, known as PIPE, to verify the robustness of our analysis. The extracted secondary eclipse lightcurves were modeled using the PYCHEOPS package, where we have detrended the background noise correlated with the spacecraft roll angle, originating from the inhomogeneous and asymmetric shape of the CHEOPS point spread function, using an N-order glint function. Results: Our independent lightcurve analyses have resulted in consistent estimations of the eclipse depths, with values of 89.9$\pm$13.7 ppm for the DRP analysis and 85.2$\pm$13.1 ppm from PIPE, indicating a high degree of statistical agreement. Adopting the DRP value yields a highly constrained geometric albedo of 0.73$\pm$0.11. No significant eclipse depth variability is detected down to a level of $\sim$37 ppm. Conclusions: Our results confirm that LTT9779b exhibits a strikingly high optical albedo, which substantially reduces the internal energy budget of the planet compared to more opaque...

 - **Abstract**
 The cold, dense matter equation of state (EoS) determines crucial global properties of neutron stars (NSs), including the mass, radius and tidal deformability. However, a one-dimensional (1D), cold, and $\beta$-equilibrated EoS is insufficient to fully describe the interactions or capture the dynamical processes of dense matter as realized in binary neutron star (BNS) mergers or core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe), where thermal and out-of-equilibrium effects play important roles. We develop a method to self-consistently extend a 1D cold and $\beta$-equilibrated EoS of quark matter to a full three-dimensional (3D) version, accounting for density, temperature, and electron fraction dependencies, within the framework of Fermi-liquid theory (FLT), incorporating both thermal and out-of-equilibrium contributions. We compare our FLT-extended EoS with the original bag model and find that our approach successfully reproduces the contributions of thermal and compositional dependencies of the 3D EoS. Furthermore, we construct a 3D EoS with a first-order phase transition (PT) by matching our 3D FLT-extended quark matter EoS to the hadronic DD2 EoS under Maxwell construction, and test it through the GRHD simulations of the TOV-star and CCSN explosion. Both simulations produce consistent results with previous studies, demonstrating the effectiveness and robustness of our 3D EoS construction with PT.

 - **Abstract**
 The gravothermal core collapse of self-interacting dark matter halos provides a compelling mechanism for seeding supermassive black holes in the early Universe. In this scenario, a small fraction of a halo, approximately $1\%$ of its mass, collapses into a dense core, which could further evolve into a black hole. We demonstrate that this process can account for the origin of JWST little red dots (LRDs) observed at redshifts $z\sim4-11$, where black holes with masses of $10^7{\rm\,M_\odot}$ can form within $500{\rm\,Myr}$ after the formation of host halos with masses of $10^{9}{\rm\,M_\odot}$. Even if the initial collapse region triggering general-relativistic instability has a mass on the order of one solar mass, the resulting seed can grow into an intermediate-mass black hole via Eddington accretion of baryonic gas. Subsequently, it can continue to grow into a supermassive black hole through dark Bondi accretion of dark matter particles. In this scenario, the majority of the black hole's mass originates from dark matter accretion rather than baryonic matter, naturally explaining the overmassive feature of LRDs.

 - **Abstract**
 This work is the continuation of a series attempting to characterize the local warm ionized medium through both static and time dependent simulations. We build upon our three dimensional, observationally-derived simulation of the local photoionized interstellar medium - based on static photoionization simulations constrained by 3D dust maps - to include metals required to predict collisionally excited optical and infrared emission lines, providing the first all-sky prediction of a series of lines including [SII] 6716$\mathring{A}$, [NII] 6584$\mathring{A}$ and [OIII] 5007$\mathring{A}$. While these predictions only include O-star photoionization under ionization equilibrium, we also carry out a suite of radiation-hydrodynamics simulations including time-dependent metal ionization and the effects of supernova feedback to highlight missing features in our predicted skies. We use the simulations to estimate the very local (1 $\rm kpc^{2}$) Galactic star formation rate, finding a rate of 370 $\rm M_{\odot}~Myr^{-1}~kpc^{-2}$ provides the best match between the observationally-derived and ab-initio simulations. This is approximately a factor of four lower than previous estimates for the star formation rate required to support an observed layer of high-altitude diffuse ionized gas, possibly suggesting a `bursty' star formation history in the region surrounding the Sun. We also investigate the effects of O-star environments on their ability to ionize large volumes of diffuse ionized gas, and find it is likely ionized by a small number of luminous O-stars located in regions where the leakage of their Lyman continuum photons can produce the vast volumes of ionized gas observed in the midplane and at high galactic altitudes.

 - **Abstract**
 We recently identified an upturn in [Na/Fe] for the population of Solar-type stars in the Galactic thick disc ($-0.3 < [\mathrm{Fe/H}] < +0.3$ dex) at super-Solar metallicity in GALactic Archaeology with HERMES (GALAH) data. Here, we investigate the cause of this unexplained Na enrichment between ([Fe/H] $\sim 0 - 0.6$ dex) using the OMEGA$+$ galactic chemical evolution code. We investigate the increase of [Na/Fe] with four combinations of nucleosynthetic yields from the literature, with source contributions from core-collapse supernovae, asymptotic giant branch stars, and Type Ia supernovae. We focus on two possible causes for the Na-enhancement: the "metallicity effect" resulting from core-collapse supernovae at super-Solar metallicity and the contribution of metal-rich AGB stars. We adopt two sets of Type Ia supernova yields with one model assuming only Chandrasekhar-mass explosions, and another assuming only sub-Chandrasekhar-mass explosions. We find that the assumed Type Ia explosion has little effect on the [Na/Fe] Galactic chemical evolution modelling, and all Galactic chemical evolution models tested fail to reproduce the observed [\mathrm{Na/Fe}] enrichment in the young thick disc population at super-Solar metallicities. Our study indicates a possible "under-pollution effect" by SNe Ia, which are the dominant producers of iron, in the Galactic disc's Solar-type star population. These findings provide a step forward toward understanding the origin of the unexplained sodium enrichment at super-Solar metallicities in the Galactic disc.

 - **Abstract**
 Astrometry with the very long baseline radio interferometry (VLBI) allows us to determine the position of a point close to the brightest compact detail of the source at milliarcsecond scales. For most active galactic nuclei (AGNs), this compact detail is the opaque core of the radio jet. Rare cases of sources whose brightest detail is not the core but a prominent jet feature parsecs away from the core have been reported, but such sources remained elusive. In this work, we use a novel method for a systematic search of these sources. We scrutinize the AGNs for which the offset between their coordinates determined with VLBI and Gaia is statistically significant and coincides with the vector between two dominant features in their VLBI images, using publicly available archival multi-frequency data. We find 35 sources whose VLBI coordinates are associated with a bright component of their jet separated by several to tens of mas from the radio core. Their Gaia coordinates, in turn, correspond to the jet origin and are close to the radio jet core. The previously published jet directions of most of them must be reversed. These sources exhibit atypically low brightness temperatures of the radio cores, down to 10^9 K in the host galaxy frame, and, at the same time, extreme brightness of the dominating jet components. We argue that these bright components are standing shock fronts and discuss possible physical reasons for the low core brightness, such as ineffective particle heating, atypical absorption, or differential Doppler boosting.

 - **Abstract**
 Filaments/prominences are cold plasma (~ 10000 K) embedded in the solar corona, two orders of magnitude hotter. Filament plasma is structured by the magnetic field in thin elongated threads. Counter-streaming flows have been observed. The aim of this paper is to characterize these flows. For that, we use high spatial resolution observations of spectral data obtained with THEMIS in H-alpha and with IRIS in Mg II k lines on 29 September 2023. We best detect counter-streaming flows in both the blue and red wings of these spectral lines. They are forming long Doppler shifted strands slightly inclined on the filament axis. The blue/red shift alternates across the strands at the arc second scale. H-alpha spectral profiles with large widths are interpreted as formed by multi-strands with opposite velocity directions. The absorption in the core of Mg II k line is also broader than in the chromosphere. This corresponds also to counter-streaming velocities. We derive that a fraction of the filament plasma is moving at supersonic speed (of the order of 20 km/s ) with the assumption that the filament is optically thick. We conclude that the counter-directed Doppler shifts might not be magnetic field aligned flows but rather correspond to kink transverse oscillations of the magnetic field with independent motions in nearby strands.
#### Discovery of diffuse $γ$-ray emission in the vicinity of G213.0-0.6: Supernova remnant versus massive star-forming region

 - **Abstract**
 We report the discovery of high-energy $\gamma$-ray emission in the vicinity of G213.0-0.6, which is debated as a supernova remnant (SNR) or an ionized hydrogen (H$_{\rm{II}}$) region. Using 16-yr Pass 8 data from Fermi Large Area Telescope (Fermi-LAT), we found three extended sources with different photon spectra in this region, which will label as SrcA, SrcB and SrcC. Among them, the $\gamma$-ray source SrcA with a log-parabola spectrum is spatially coincident with a star-forming region and several OB stars. The power-law spectra source SrcB is spatially coincident with a SNR radio shell. SrcC with a harder power-law photon spectrum is located outside of the radio shell structure. All of them are spatially coincident with a dense molecular cloud (MC) in the velocity range of 35 - 54 km s$^{-1}$. In this scenario, SrcB can be interpreted as the GeV counterpart of the SNR, and its $\gamma$-ray emission originates from the shock-cloud interaction. SrcA and SrcC originate from the escaped CRs illuminating nearby MC. For SrcA, another possibility is that the $\gamma$-ray emission originates from a young stellar cluster (YSC) associated with a star-forming region (SFR), however, the supporting evidence remains insufficient to draw a definitive conclusion.

 - **Abstract**
 Tidal disruption events (TDEs) are expected to release much of their energy in the far-ultraviolet (UV), which we do not observe directly. However, infrared (IR) observations can observe re-radiation of the optical/UV emission from dust, and if this dust is observed in the process of sublimation, we can infer the un-observed UV radiated energy. TDEs have also been predicted to show spectra shallower than a blackbody in the IR, but this has not yet been observed. We present near/mid-IR observations of the TDE AT 2019azh spanning from -3 d before peak until >1750 d after. We evaluate these observations for consistency with dust emission or direct emission from the TDE. We fit the IR data with a modified blackbody associated with dust emission. The UV+optical+IR data are compared with simulated spectra produced from general relativistic radiation magnetohydrodynamics simulations of super-Eddington accretion. We model the data at later times (> 200 d) as an IR echo. The IR data at the maximum light can not be self-consistently fit with dust emission. Instead, the data can be better fit with a reprocessing model, with the IR excess arising due to the absorption opacity being dominated by free-free processes in the dense reprocessing envelope. We infer a large viewing angle of $\sim$60$^{\circ}$, consistent with previously reported X-ray observations, and a tidally disrupted star with mass > 2 M$_{\odot}$. The IR emission at later times is consistent with cool dust emission. We model these data as an IR echo and find that the dust is distant (0.65 pc), and clumpy, with a low covering factor. We show that TDEs can have an IR excess not arising from dust and that IR observations at early times can constrain the viewing angle for the TDE in the unified model. Near-IR observations are therefore essential to distinguish between hot dust and a non-thermal IR excess.
#### Semiconvection unlocks dynamo action in stably-stratified regions of gaseous planets

 - **Abstract**
 Stably-stratified fluid layers are ubiquitous in gaseous planets, stellar and liquid cores, and have previously been thought not to be capable of driving a dynamo. We demonstrate that semiconvection (convection driven by a destabilising thermal gradient in an overall stably stratified region) can actually lead to dynamo action in such regions. Motivated by recent works suggesting that significant regions of Jupiter and Saturn may be prone to semiconvection, we conduct direct numerical simulations in spherical shells in the planetary relevant limit of low magnetic Prandtl numbers. We retrieve key characteristics of planetary magnetic fields, including dipolarity, magnetic field strength, and the form of the energy spectrum. This short demonstration opens the possibility for further more detailed studies of semiconvection dynamos, that can also be relevant for stellar interiors.
#### Circular Mystery: Exploring Diffuse Emission Surrounding a Radio Galaxy with uGMRT and VLA Multiwavelength Observations

 - **Abstract**
 We report the discovery of J1218+1813, a circular diffuse radio source detected in the Very Large Array (VLA) FIRST survey at 1400 MHz. The source has an angular diameter of approximately one arcminute, corresponding to a physical size of ~180 kpc, and is associated with an elliptical galaxy with a redshift of z = 0.139635. To investigate its nature, we conducted a comprehensive multiwavelength analysis spanning both high and low radio frequencies, utilizing the VLA in C-configuration at L, C and X bands, along with the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT) at bands 3 (250-500 MHz), 4 (550-850 MHz), and 5 (1000-1460 MHz). A spectral study based on these multiwavelength observations reveals that the core of J1218+1813 exhibits a steep spectral index of 0.8, indicating that the emission is dominated by optically thin synchrotron radiation. The spectral index varies between 1.1 and 1.8, from the inner to the outer structure, with the steepest values observed at the periphery of the diffuse emission. An optical analysis of the central host galaxy using spectroscopic data is also performed. The estimated black hole mass is $2.8 \pm 0.8 \times 10^{8}$ M${_\odot}$, while the host galaxy has a stellar mass of 2.9 $\times$ 10$^{11}$ M${_\odot}$ and a stellar age of 8.58 Gyr. The identification of J1218+1813 is particularly significant because it provides insight into the mechanisms responsible for the formation of circular diffuse radio structures surrounded by an elliptical galaxy. Potential formation scenarios for J1218+1813 are discussed in this paper.

 - **Abstract**
 The angular resolution measure (ARM) is widely used in Compton camera analyses to characterize angular uncertainty and to define event selection criteria. However, the ARM distribution is fundamentally different from the point spread function (PSF), which represents the true spatial imaging response of the system on the celestial sphere. In this study, motivated by applications in gamma-ray astrophysics, we investigated the consequences of using ARM-based definitions in sensitivity estimation and image reconstruction. Through Monte Carlo simulations of 662 keV gamma-rays, we demonstrated that the background rejection power of ARM-based region-of-interest selections with the ARM resolution of 7.0$^{\circ}$ is equivalent to that of a PSF resolution of 33$^{\circ}$. As a result, treating the ARM resolution as a surrogate for the PSF resolution leads to significant overestimation of the signal-to-noise ratio, particularly in analyses assuming isotropic backgrounds. We further show that image reconstructions at pixel scales finer than the PSF resolution introduce substantial statistical uncertainties, reducing the effective number of independent spatial degrees of freedom. These findings underscore the necessity of PSF-based analysis for accurate sensitivity evaluation and statistically robust imaging in Compton cameras, particularly in applications where the background discrimination is critical.
#### The influence of interior structure and thermal state on impact melt generation upon large impacts onto terrestrial planets

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.18718

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the melt production of planetary impacts as a function of planet size ($R/R_\mathrm{Earth}$=0.1-1.5), impactor size ($L$=1-1000 km), and core size ratio ($R_\mathrm{core}/R$=0.2-0.8) using a combination of parameterized convection models and fully dynamical 2D impact simulations. To this end, we introduce a new method to determine impact-induced melt volumes which we normalize by the impactor volume for better comparability. We find that this normalized melt production, or melting efficiency, is enhanced for large planets when struck by smaller impactors, while for small planets, melting efficiency is elevated when impacted by larger impactors. This diverging behavior can be explained by the thickness of the planets' thermal boundary layer and the shapes of their thermal and lithostatic pressure profiles. We also find that melting efficiency maxima are usually highest on Earth-size planets. We show that the melting efficiency is only affected by core size ratio for large cores and older planets, where melt production is decreased significantly compared to smaller core size ratios. Projecting the lunar impactor flux on the generic planets, we find that Moon-sized planets produce the most melt throughout their evolution, relative to planet volume. Contrary to previous scaling laws, our method accounts for melt production by decompression or plastic work in addition to shock melting. We find that traditional scaling laws underestimate melt production on length scales where variations in the target planets' lithology, temperature, and lithostatic pressure become significant. We propose empirical formulas to predict melt generation as a function of radial structure and thermal age.

 - **Abstract**
 Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration radio transients of extragalactic origin, exhibiting a wide range of physical and observational properties. Distinguishing between repeating and non-repeating FRBs remains a key challenge in understanding their nature. In this work, we apply unsupervised machine learning techniques to classify FRBs based on both primary observables from the CHIME catalog and physically motivated derived features. We evaluate three hybrid pipelines combining dimensionality reduction with clustering: PCA + k-means, t-SNE + HDBSCAN, and t-SNE + Spectral Clustering. To identify optimal hyperparameters, we implement a comprehensive grid search using a custom scoring function that prioritizes recall while penalizing excessive cluster fragmentation and noise. Feature relevance is assessed using principal component loadings, mutual information with the known repeater label, and permutation-based F\textsubscript{2} score sensitivity. Our results demonstrate that the derived features including redshift, luminosity, and spectral properties, such as the spectral index and the spectral running, significantly enhance the classification performance. Finally, we identify a set of FRBs currently labeled as non-repeaters that consistently cluster with known repeaters across all methods, highlighting promising candidates for future follow-up observations and reinforcing the utility of unsupervised approaches in FRB population studies.

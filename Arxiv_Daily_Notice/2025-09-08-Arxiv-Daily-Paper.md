#### The Landscape of Collapsar Outflows: Structure, Signatures and Origins of Einstein Probe Relativistic Supernova Transients

 - **Abstract**
 The Einstein Probe is revolutionizing time-domain astrophysics through the discovery of new classes of X-ray transients associated with Type Ic-Broad Line supernovae. These events commonly exhibit bright early-time optical counterparts, and sudden afterglow rebrightening within the first week - features that existing models fail to explain. In particular, structured jet and cocoon scenarios are inconsistent with the observed sharp rebrightening and multi-day optical emission, while the refreshed shock model is ruled out due to its inconsistency with collapsar hydrodynamics. Drawing on 3D general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations, we present the multi-scale angular and radial structure characterizing collapsar outflows. The resulting morphology features episodic, wobbling jets with a "top-hat" geometry, embedded within a smoother global cocoon and disk ejecta angular structure. The wobbling jets give rise to variations in radiative efficiency that can account for the observed alternation between X-ray-dominated and $\gamma$-ray-dominated jet emission. The top-hat structure of individual wobbling jet episodes naturally explains the sudden rebrightening observed when the emission from the top-hat jet cores enters the observer's line of sight. The radial structure is consistent with that inferred from observations of stripped-envelope supernovae. It comprises a mildly relativistic cocoon ($0.3\lesssim\beta\Gamma\lesssim3$) that may power an early ($\sim1\,{\rm day}$) rapidly decaying emission, followed by slower, black hole accretion disk-driven outflows ($\beta\lesssim0.3$), which dominate the slowly evolving optical emission at $t\gtrsim1\,{\rm day}$. This novel multi-component outflow structure provides a unified explanation for the multiband light curves observed in Einstein Probe transients and is likely a common feature of Type Ic-Broad Line supernovae more broadly.

 - **Abstract**
 A handful of enigmatic Jupiter-mass objects have been discovered orbiting pulsars. One such object, PSR J2322-2650b, uniquely resembles a hot Jupiter exoplanet due to its minimum density of 1.8 g/cm^3 and its ~1900 K equilibrium temperature. We use JWST to observe its emission spectrum across an entire orbit. In stark contrast to every known exoplanet orbiting a main-sequence star, we find an atmosphere rich in molecular carbon (C3, C2) with strong westward winds. Our observations open up a new exoplanetary chemical regime (ultra-high C/O and C/N ratios of >100 and >10,000 respectively) and dynamical regime (ultra-fast rotation with external irradiation) to observational study. The extreme carbon enrichment poses a severe challenge to the current understanding of "black widow" companions, which were expected to consist of a wider range of elements due to their origins as stripped stellar cores.

 - **Abstract**
 Episodic mass accretion is the dominant mechanism for mass assembly in the proto-stellar phase. Although prior optical time-domain searches have allowed detailed studies of individual outbursts, these searches remain insensitive to the earliest stages of star formation. In this paper, we present the characterization of two FU Orionis (FUor) outbursts identified using the combination of the ground-based, near-infrared Wide-field Infrared Transient Explorer (WINTER) and the space-based, mid-infrared NEOWISE survey. Supplemented with near-infrared spectroscopic follow-up, we show that both objects are bona fide FUor type outbursts based on i) their proximity to star-forming regions, ii) large amplitude (2-4 magnitudes) infrared brightening over the last decade, iii) progenitor colors consistent with embedded (Class I) protostars, and iv) "mixed-temperature" infrared spectra exhibiting characteristic signatures of cool outer envelopes and a hot inner disk with a wind. While one source, WNTR24-cua, is a known FUor which we independently recover; the second source, WNTR24-egv, is a newly confirmed object. Neither source is detected in contemporaneous ground-based optical imaging, despite flux limits $\gtrsim 100\times$ fainter than their infrared brightness, demonstrating the capabilities of WINTER to identify heavily obscured young stellar object (YSO) outbursts. We highlight the capabilities of the Galactic Plane survey of the recently commissioned WINTER observatory in addressing the poorly understood FUor population with its unique combination of real-time detection capabilities, multi-color sensitivity, weekly cadence, and wide area coverage.

 - **Abstract**
 We report Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) \hii\ imaging of NGC\,4141, the host galaxy of FRB\,20250316A at $z=0.0063$. Our GMRT \hii\ images have spatial resolutions, at $z\approx0.0063$, of $\approx0.48-8.0$~kpc, and find evidence for (i)~a companion galaxy, LEDA\,2582852, to the south-west, (ii)~a nearby (27-kpc distant) H{\sc{i}} cloud to the south-west, (iii)~disturbances in the H{\sc{i}} distributions of both NGC\,4141 and LEDA\,2582852, and (iv)~high H{\sc{i}} column densities in the south-western outskirts of NGC\,4141. A Sloan Digital Sky Survey spectrum shows evidence for a low metallicity and a high star-formation rate (SFR) surface density activity in the south-western disk of NGC\,4141, while H$\alpha$-based SFR estimates over the last 10~Myr are higher than radio-based SFRs over the last 100~Myr. The above evidence indicates that NGC\,4141 has recently acquired metal-poor gas, via either a merger or accretion, that resulted in the south-western starburst and that may have also triggered large-scale star-formation activity in NGC\,4141, resulting in the formation of the stellar progenitor of FRB\,20250316A and the other transients. Our highest-resolution (480~pc) GMRT H{\sc{i}} 21\,cm image finds no H{\sc{i}} 21\,cm emission from the location of FRB\,20250316A or the nearby star-forming region, suggesting that most of the H{\sc{i}} here has been either ionized or converted into the molecular phase. Our non-detection of continuum emission at the location of FRB\,20250316A yields the $3\sigma$ upper limit $<3.2\times10^{25}$~erg~s$^{-1}$~Hz$^{-1}$, on the 1.4~GHz specific luminosity of a putative persistent radio source associated with FRB\,20250316A, one of the strongest constraints on the radio luminosity of such an associated persistent radio source.

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar evolution theory predicts that electron--positron pair production in the cores of massive stars triggers unstable thermonuclear explosions that prevent the direct formation of black holes above about $50\,M_\odot$, creating a ``pair-instability gap''. Yet black holes have been detected above this mass with gravitational waves; such objects might be explained with uncertainties in the physics of massive stars and stellar collapse or with hierarchical mergers of black holes in stellar clusters. Hierarchical mergers are associated with large spins as predicted by general relativity, and isotropic spin orientations. Here we present strong evidence for the pair-instability mass gap in the LIGO--Virgo--KAGRA fourth transient catalog, with a lower edge at $45.3^{+6.5}_{-4.8}\,M_\odot$. We also obtain a measurement of the ${}^{12}\mathrm{C}(\alpha,\gamma){}^{16}\mathrm{O}$ reaction rate, yielding an $S$-factor of $242.5^{+310.4}_{-101.5}\,\mathrm{keV\,b}$, a parameter critical for modeling helium burning and stellar evolution. The new data reveal two populations: a low-spin group with no black holes above the gap, consistent with direct stellar collapse, and a high-spin, isotropic group that extends across the full mass range and occupies the gap, consistent with hierarchical mergers. These findings confirm the role of pair-instability in shaping the black hole spectrum, establish a new link between gravitational-wave astronomy and nuclear astrophysics, and highlight hierarchical mergers and star cluster dynamics as key channels in the growth of black holes.
#### Formation of a Coronal Hole by a quiet-Sun Filament Eruption

 - **Abstract**
 A coronal hole formed as a result of a quiet-Sun filament eruption close to the solar disk center on 2014 June 25. We studied this formation using images from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA), magnetograms from the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI), and a differential emission measure (DEM) analysis derived from the AIA images. The coronal hole developed in three stages: (1) formation, (2) migration, and (3) stabilization. In the formation phase, the emission measure (EM) and temperature started to decrease six hours before the filament erupted. Then, the filament erupted and a large coronal dimming formed over the following three hours. Subsequently, in a phase lasting $15.5$~hours, the coronal dimming migrated by 150" from its formation site to a location where potential field source surface extrapolations indicate the presence of open magnetic field lines, marking the transition into a coronal hole. During this migration, the coronal hole drifted across quasi-stationary magnetic elements in the photosphere, implying the occurrence of magnetic interchange reconnection at the boundaries of the coronal hole. In the stabilization phase, the magnetic properties and area of the coronal hole became constant. The EM of the coronal hole decreased, which we interpret as a reduction in plasma density due to the onset of plasma outflow into interplanetary space. As the coronal hole rotated towards the solar limb, it merged with a nearby pre-existing coronal hole. At the next solar rotation, the coronal hole was still apparent, indicating a lifetime of >1 solar rotation.

 - **Abstract**
 Angular momentum transport in high-mass stars is commonly modeled by extrapolating the behavior of better-observed low-mass stars. According to the conventional picture, the cores of most black hole progenitors lose almost all of their angular momentum when their outer layers are ejected before core collapse. Accordingly, most black holes are expected to be born with dimensionless spin magnitudes of $\chi \lesssim 0.01$, even if some black holes are born with non-negligible spin due to tidal interactions in a progenitor binary. One might therefore expect to find a large fraction of $\chi \lesssim 0.01$ black holes in merging binary black hole (BBH) systems. We find that the conventional picture of angular momentum transport is in tension with data from LIGO--Virgo--KAGRA's fourth gravitational-wave transient catalog. We find no support for a sub-population of BBH systems with $\chi \lesssim 0.01$. Neither do we find support for a sub-population with only one spinning black hole as expected for tidal spin-up scenarios. Instead, we find evidence for two subpopulations in which both black holes have non-negligible spin. Approximately 84% of BBH systems contain two black holes with modest spins $\chi \approx 0.1$ and approximately 16% contain two black holes with large spins $\chi \approx 0.8$. These estimates come from our best-fit model, which is favored with natural log Bayes factors $\ln B \gtrsim 3$ over models that require a sub-population of $\chi \lesssim 0.01$ black holes, and models that do not contain multiple spin sub-populations. These results are difficult to reconcile with our current understanding of angular momentum transport.
#### SN 2022acko and the Properties of its Red Supergiant Progenitor: Direct Detection, Light Curves, and Nebular Spectroscopy

 - **Abstract**
 We present ultraviolet, optical, and infrared observations of the Type II-P supernova SN 2022acko in NGC 1300, located at a distance of 19.0 +/- 2.9 Mpc. Our dataset spans 1-350 days post-explosion in photometry, complemented by late-time optical spectroscopy covering 200-600 days, and includes deep pre-explosion imaging. We use this extensive multiwavelength dataset for both direct and indirect constraints on the progenitor system. Using the early-time photometry and shock-cooling models, we infer that SN 2022acko likely originated from a red supergiant with a radius of R ~ 580 solar radii and an initial mass of M ~ 9-10 solar masses. From the radioactive decay tail, we infer a synthesized Ni56 mass of 0.014 +/- 0.004 solar masses. We further model nebular-phase spectra using radiative transfer models and nucleosynthesis yields for core-collapse supernovae, which suggest a progenitor initial mass in the range of 10-15 solar masses. Meanwhile, blackbody fitting of the detected pre-explosion counterpart in the F814W and F160W bands indicates a red supergiant with a lower initial mass of approximately 7.5 solar masses. The light curve exhibits a 116 days plateau, indicative of a massive hydrogen-rich envelope, inconsistent with the pre-explosion analysis. We investigated the discrepancy between direct and indirect progenitor mass estimates, focusing on the roles of binary interaction, early-time modeling limitations, and systematic uncertainties in spectral calibration. Our results indicate that the tension among mass estimates likely arises from modeling limitations and flux calibration uncertainties rather than from insufficient data, highlighting the need for more physically realistic models and a deeper understanding of systematic effects.
#### Attributing the supernova remnant RCW 89 to the jittering jets explosion mechanism

 - **Abstract**
 I examine recent radio observations of the supernova remnant (SNR) RCW 89 and identify a point-symmetric morphology composed of two main symmetry axes. I attribute this morphology to a jet-driven explosion in the framework of the jittering jets explosion mechanism (JJEM). To reach this conclusion, I argue that the MSH 15-52 nebula associated with the pulsar PSR B1509-58, the X-ray hand-like-shaped nebula, and RCW 89 are two separate core-collapse supernova (CCSN) remnants that interact with each other. Namely, the nebula SNR G320.4-1.2 contains two CCSN remnants. In essence, I utilize the recent successes of the JJEM to account for the morphologies of point-symmetric CCSN remnants, thereby explaining the morphology of RCW 89 and identifying it as a separate CCSN remnant. I suggest a process by which somewhat more energetic pairs of jets in the JJEM have a positive feedback on the accreted gas onto the newly born neutron star, thereby prolonging the life of the jets and explaining the occurrence of two or three energetic pairs of jets in some CCSNe. This study adds RCW 89 to the growing list of point-symmetric CCSN remnants. The JJEM naturally explains these morphologies as shaped by misaligned pairs of jets that exploded these CCSNe.

 - **Abstract**
 Solar jets are collimated plasma ejections driven by magnetic reconnection, which play a critical role in the energy release and mass transport in the solar atmosphere. Using Solar Orbiter's Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUI) with its unprecedented spatiotemporal resolution, we report the discovery of nine transient coronal jets associated with a filament eruption on September 30, 2024. These jets, with a median lifetime of only 22 seconds, have significantly shorter timescales than previously observed coronal jets. They exhibit diverse morphologies and properties, evolving through three distinct phases of the filament eruption: initiation, rise, and peak. The spatial and temporal distribution of the jets suggests they are driven by dynamic magnetic reconnection between the erupting filament and overlying magnetic fields. These jets represent a distinct class of phenomena different from traditional mini-filament-driven jets, being directly associated with large-scale filament eruption processes. This study reveals a previously unrecognised class of highly transient jets, highlighting the complexity of reconnection-driven processes during filament eruptions and underscoring the importance of high-resolution observations in uncovering fundamental plasma dynamics in the solar atmosphere.

 - **Abstract**
 Solar filament eruptions play a key role in driving space weather, yet their fine-scale evolution remains poorly understood due to observational limitations. Using unprecedented high-resolution observations from Solar Orbiter's Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (105 km/pixel) and Polarimetric and Helioseismic Imager, we reveal persistent magnetic reconnection events in a failed filament eruption. We identify magnetic reconnections between the filament and surrounding magnetic field structures, with both frequency and type far exceeding previous observations. These reconnections significantly affect the filament stability and eruption dynamics, leading to sequential coronal jets and failed eruptions. We propose a 'persistent magnetic cutting' concept, highlighting how persistent small-scale magnetic reconnections cumulatively affect filament stability during its evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 Turbulence influences the structure and dynamics of molecular clouds, and plays a key role in regulating star formation. We therefore need methods to accurately infer turbulence properties of molecular clouds from position-position-velocity (PPV) spectral observations. A previous method calibrated with simulation data exists to recover the 3D turbulent velocity dispersion from PPV data. However, that method relies on optically-thin conditions, ignoring any radiative transfer (RT) and chemical effects. In the present study we determine how opacity, RT, and chemical effects influence turbulence measurements with CO lines. We post-process a chemo-dynamical simulation of a turbulent collapsing cloud with a non-local thermodynamic equilibrium line RT code to generate PPV spectral cubes of the CO (1-0) and CO (2-1) lines, and obtain moment maps. We isolate the turbulence in the first-moment maps by using a Gaussian smoothing approach. We compare the CO results with the optically-thin scenario to explore how line excitation and RT impact the turbulence measurements. We find that the turbulent velocity dispersion (sigma_v) measured via CO requires a correction by a factor R_CO, with R_CO,1-0 = 0.88 (+0.09, -0.08) for the CO (1-0) line and R_CO,2-1 = 0.88 (+0.10, -0.08) for the CO (2-1) line. As a consequence, previous measurements of sigma_v were overestimated by about 10-15% on average, with potential overestimates as high as 40%, taking the 1-sigma uncertainty into account.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the impact of dark matter (DM) on both hybrid and twin stars within a two-fluid framework, where DM and normal matter interact only through gravity. A self-interacting fermionic DM model is considered, while for nucleonic and quark matter we employ the relativistic mean-field model and the constant sound-speed parametrization, respectively. Our results show that DM significantly influences the formation of hybrid and twin stars, depending on the transition pressure and the discontinuity in energy density at a fixed sound speed. The presence of DM reduces the number of twin or hybrid stars compared to the case without DM, and this effect directly depends on the DM mass and fraction. We further find that the formation of DM-core or DM-halo configurations is mainly governed by DM parameters, whereas the realization of twin or hybrid star scenarios is primarily controlled by quark parameters. Using the $2M_\odot$ constraint, we demonstrate that the parameter space for twin stars can be further restricted in both DM-core and DM-halo scenarios.

 - **Abstract**
 To date, quantification of the on-sky motion for interstellar clouds have relied on proxies such as young stellar objects (YSO) and masers. We present the first direct measurement of an interstellar cloud proper motion using the VISTA Star Formation Atlas (VISIONS) multi-epoch infrared images of the Corona Australis star-forming region. Proper motions are extracted by tracking the morphology of extended structures in the cloud complex based on image registration techniques implemented in SimpleITK. Our determined values ($\mu_{\alpha^*} \sim +15$ mas/yr, $\mu_{\delta} \sim -30$ mas/yr) are in good agreement with those obtained for YSOs and young stellar clusters in the region. This study demonstrates the potential of image registration for directly mapping the kinematics of nearby molecular clouds, opening a new window into the study of cloud dynamics.

 - **Abstract**
 Infrared Dark Clouds (IRDCs) are cold, dense structures representative of the initial conditions of star formation. Many studies of IRDCs employ CO to investigate cloud dynamics. However, CO can be highly depleted from the gas phase in IRDCs, impacting its fidelity as tracer. CO depletion is also of great interest in astrochemistry, since CO ice in dust grain mantles provides the raw material for forming complex organic molecules. We study CO depletion toward four IRDCs to investigate how it correlates with volume density and dust temperature, calculated from Herschel images. We use 13CO(1-0) and (2-1) maps to measure CO depletion factor, $f_D$, across IRDCs G23.46-00.53, G24.49-00.70, G24.94-00.15, and G25.16-00.28. We also consider a normalized CO depletion factor, f_D', which takes a value of unity, i.e., no depletion, in the outer, lower density, warmer regions. We then investigate the dependence of f_D and f_D' on gas density, $n_H$ and dust temperature, $T_{dust}$. We find CO depletion rises as density increases, reaching maximum values of f_D'$\sim$10 in regions with $n_H>3\times10^5\:{cm}^{-3}$, although with significant scatter at a given density. We find a tighter, less scattered relation of f_D' with temperature, rising rapidly for temperatures <18 K. We propose a functional form $f_D^\prime = \:{exp}(T_0/[T_{dust}-T_1])$ with $T_0\simeq4\:$K and $T_1\simeq12\:$K to reproduce this behaviour. We conclude that CO is heavily depleted from the gas phase in cold, dense regions of IRDCs. Thus CO depletion can lead to underestimation of total cloud masses based on CO line fluxes by factors up to 5. These results indicate a dominant role for thermal desorption in setting near equilibrium abundances of gas phase CO in IRDCs, providing important constraints for both astrochemical models and the chemodynamical history of gas during the early stages of star formation.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we present an off-lattice Monte Carlo model of accretion and migration of hydrogen atoms on a rough surface of carbon dust grain. The migration of physisorbed atoms by means of thermal diffusion and quantum tunnelling through barriers between the surface potential minima is considered. The model is applied to simulations of molecular hydrogen formation in a cold interstellar medium for a temperature range 5-35 K. Eley-Rideal and Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanisms for the formation of the H$_2$ molecule were taken into account. We found that the surface potential energy minima that hold the accreted hydrogen atoms (binding energy) has wide dispersion of its values. The minimum energy is three times smaller than the maximum energy for the uneven surface of the model grain. The large dispersion of the binding energies results in an extended range of temperatures where H$_2$ formation is efficient: 5-25 K. The dispersion of binding energies also reduces efficiency of diffusion due to tunnelling in comparison to that assumed in kinetic equation codes in which constant values of binding energies are employed. Thus, thermal hopping is the main source for the mobility of the hydrogen atoms in the presented off-lattice model. Finally, the model naturally provides the mean values for the ratio of binding-to-desorption energy. This ratio demonstrates weak dependence on temperature and is in the range of 0.5-0.6.

 - **Abstract**
 The diffuse interstellar band (DIB) at 6196 A exhibits notable profile variations across the Milky Way. This study addresses three open issues: the unusual broadening of the DIB profile towards Upper Sco (USco), the lack of profile variations towards stars near $\eta$ Car, and the origin of the blueshift observed in Sco OB1. Using archival spectra of 453 early-type stars across the Galactic disk and in its proximity, we created a catalogue of the DIB's profile parameters. Our analysis identified Doppler-split components within the DIB profiles across most regions with no evidence for these splits being able to account for the observed broadening (23 km/s) in USco or other regions such as Orion, Vela OB2, and Melotte 20 ($\alpha$ Per cluster). We propose that neither the ages of the studied stellar populations nor the distances between clusters and nearby clouds significantly contribute to the broadening. However, we detect a gradient in the full width at half maximum within the Sco-Cen and Orion regions, where broadening decreases with distance from the star-forming centres. This result points to a possible connection between the DIB broadening and star formation (likely via the impact of recent supernovae). Regarding the Carina Nebula, we confirm the lack of DIB profile variations in a small region near $\eta$ Car, although an adjacent southern area exhibits significant variations, comparable to those in USco. In addition to the Carina Nebula, we find that the Rosette Nebula and NGC 6405 also show consistently narrow profiles (<20 km/s) with minimal deviations from the median over spatial scales of a few parsecs. Finally, regarding the origin of the blueshift observed in Sco OB1, we used a comparison with the Lagoon Nebula and argue that the most natural explanation is the presence of an unresolved kinematic component in the profile of the DIB, shifting the measured centre of the band.

 - **Abstract**
 Post-asymptotic giant branch (post-AGB) stars are exquisite tracers of s-process nucleosynthesis via their surface abundances. We present a comprehensive analysis of J003643.94$-$723722.1 (J003643), a single SMC post-AGB star, using high-resolution UVES/VLT spectra analysed with E-iSpec. We find C/O = 16.21 and $[\mathrm{s}/\mathrm{Fe}]=2.09\pm0.20 \mathrm{dex}$. We also report the first direct Pb detection in a post-AGB star from the Pb II 5608.853 A line, with $[\mathrm{Pb}/\mathrm{Fe}]=3.18\,\mathrm{dex}$. Comparison with post-AGB samples in the Galaxy and Magellanic Clouds reveals that J003643 has an unusually high C/O ratio. J003643's $[\mathrm{C}/\mathrm{Fe}]=1.33\pm0.14 \mathrm{dex}$ and $[\mathrm{s}/\mathrm{Fe}]=2.09\pm0.20\,\mathrm{dex}$ are consistent with third dredge-up enrichment, but its $[\mathrm{O}/\mathrm{Fe}]=-0.08\pm0.20\,\mathrm{dex}$ is low relative to objects of similar $[\mathrm{C}/\mathrm{Fe}]$ and $[\mathrm{Fe}/\mathrm{H}]$. Together with $[\alpha/\mathrm{Fe}]\approx0\,\mathrm{dex}$ at $[\mathrm{Fe}/\mathrm{H}]\approx-1\,\mathrm{dex}$, consistent with SMC chemical evolution, this indicates the high C/O chiefly reflects oxygen deficiency rather than exceptional carbon enrichment. Additionally, we compare the full abundance pattern with yields from ATON, MONASH and FRUITY (the latter two with post-processing nucleosynthesis). Most elements are reproduced, but Pb is strongly underpredicted, highlighting a persistent gap in models of heavy-element production in AGB stars. The photospheric chemistry of J003643 adds to the growing diversity among post-AGB stars and underscores the complexity of AGB nucleosynthesis.
#### Observations of Flare Induced Doppler Shifts in the Si~\textsc{iii} $1206\,\textrm{Å}$ line

 - **Abstract**
 Doppler shifts in chromospheric and transition-region lines during solar flares are often interpreted as chromospheric condensation or evaporation. However, alternative sources of Doppler-shifted emission have been suggested, such as filament eruptions, jets or chromospheric bubbles. We analyse high-cadence scans from SORCE/SOLSTICE, which provide one-minute resolution profiles of the transition-region Si~\textsc{iii} ($1206\,\textrm{Å}$, $\textrm{T} = 10^{4.6}\,\textrm{K}$) line. 11 X-, M-, and C-class events observed during these scans with clear impulsive phase Si~\textsc{iii} enhancements were identified. By subtracting a quiet-Sun profile and fitting Gaussian profiles to the Si~\textsc{iii} line, measurements of flare-induced Doppler shifts were made. After correcting for a systematic trend in these shifts with solar longitude, two of the 11 events were found to exhibit a significant Doppler shift, \comment{}one with a $201.36\pm21.94\;\textrm{km\,s}^{-1}$ redshift and the other with a $-39.75\pm11.00\;\textrm{km\,s}^{-1}$ blueshift\commentend{}. Intriguingly, SDO/AIA $304\,\textrm{Å}$ and $1600\,\textrm{Å}$ imaging revealed a bright eruption coincident with the event that exhibited a blueshift, suggesting the shift may have resulted from the eruption rather than evaporation alone. Our results highlight Si~\textsc{iii} as a useful diagnostic of flaring dynamics at a temperature that has received limited attention to date. Future comparisons of these observations with radiative hydrodynamic simulations, along with new observations from state-of-the-art spectrometers such as SOLAR-C/EUVST and MUSE, should clarify the mechanisms behind the observed shifts in this study.

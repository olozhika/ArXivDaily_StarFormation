 - **Abstract**
 Crater II (CraII), a large and low-density dwarf spheroidal galaxy, has unusual observed properties that are difficult to reproduce in cold dark matter simulations. Ongoing tidal disruption may help explain the discrepancies, as evidenced by the recent discovery of tidal tails. Here we present metallicity-sensitive narrowband photometry of the Ca II H and K lines from the Dark Energy Camera, covering $128$ deg$^2$ across the center and identified tidal tails of CraII as part of the Mapping the Ancient Galaxy in CaHK (MAGIC) survey. Our combined photometric metallicity, color-magnitude, proper motion, and parallax selections identify 162 CraII candidates. Of these, 37 candidates are located in the tidal tails which extend at least $7^\circ$ ($\sim 95$ kpc) from the center of CraII, suggesting it has lost $\gtrsim 25$% of its initial stellar mass. We confirm low contamination rates with dedicated control fields and highlight the extremely low surface brightness stellar features that can be uncovered with CaHK data, as faint as $\sim 36$ mag arcsec$^{-2}$. We also make the first detection of a metallicity gradient ($-0.34\pm0.17~{\rm dex}~{\rm deg}^{-1}$) in the center of the galaxy and infer a stream width of $w\sim 0.8^\circ$, roughly 50% larger than the CraII half-light radius. The detection of candidates in the most distant CraII pointings from its center implies that the tidal tails extend beyond our footprint. We compare the CraII stream to $N$-body models with "cored" and "cuspy" dark matter halo progenitors, determining that CraII's density profile is still ambiguous and warrants further modeling.

 - **Abstract**
 When low-mass ($\lesssim 2$ $M_{\odot}$) red giants lose their envelopes to a companion just before the helium flash, the resulting mass transfer can produce binaries hosting hot subdwarfs, horizontal branch stars, and undermassive red clump stars. Recent work predicts a continuum of such products, from fully stripped hot subdwarfs to partially stripped horizontal branch and red clump stars, and suggests that young, metal-rich RR Lyrae can form when partial stripping leaves a helium-burning star in the instability strip. To enable direct comparison with observations, we model these binaries in a simulated Milky Way-like galaxy with a realistic metallicity-dependent star formation history and 3D dust map, generate epoch astrometry using Gaia's scanning law, and fit it with the cascade of astrometric models applied in Gaia DR3. We compare the simulated population to DR3 observations of hot subdwarfs, RR Lyrae, and red giants with high astrometric mass functions. The model significantly overpredicts the number of hot subdwarfs with astrometric binary solutions, partly because the predicted flux ratios are more unequal than observed. It also predicts $\gtrsim 100$ RR Lyrae with DR3 astrometric orbital solutions, while none are observed. We conclude that RR Lyrae in au-scale binaries may be substantially rarer than predicted. In contrast, the model plausibly explains the population of red clump stars with high astrometric mass functions, which we interpret as potential black hole impostors. We predict that $\sim 10 \times$ more stripped-star binaries will be detectable in DR4, whose sensitivity to longer periods will more strongly test wide-orbit systems.

 - **Abstract**
 Weak-interaction-mediated chiral imbalance generation in idealized massless electrons during core-collapse supernovae was once proposed to be the source of strong magnetic fields found in neutron stars. The effect goes by the name of chiral plasma instability (CPI). However, it was found that a finite electron mass damps out this process, inactivating the instability and preventing magnetic field growth. In this work we show that the instability can survive in the presence of abrupt density and temperature perturbation that drives the system sufficiently far out of weak equilibrium. As an example, we work with such perturbations generated by shockwaves which are common during both core collapse as well as neutron star mergers. We find that the chiral imbalance resulting from shock waves, under the right conditions of density and temperature, can sustain the chiral plasma instability despite the damping from the electron mass. Additionally, in an already magnetized medium, the chiral magnetic effect resulting from shock wave density and temperature perturbation can generate substantial ohmic heating. Our results imply that shockwaves during core-collapse supernovae and merging neutron stars can act as a source of strong heating in a magnetized medium as well as CPI.
#### Probing the magnetic fields and dust properties in the young embedded star-forming region AFGL 6366S using Near Infrared and Optical linear polarimetry

 - **Abstract**
 We present Near-Infrared (NIR) and Optical linear polarimetry towards the partially embedded cluster AFGL 6366S. The polarization ranges from 0.44-10.3 per cent in NIR and 0.16-11.22 per cent in Optical bands. The position angle spans $1^\circ - 179^\circ$ in both NIR and Optical bands. About 22 stars exhibit intrinsic polarization signatures. A polarization hole is evident towards the densest ($\sim 3.4 \times 10^{23} \mathrm{cm}^{-2}$) and warmest ($\sim 28.8 \mathrm{K}$) central cluster region. It is attributable to depolarization induced by Radiative Torque Disruption (RAT-D) of large grains and a modest contribution from magnetic-field tangling. The local magnetic field towards the cluster's central region is significantly misaligned with both the large-scale Galactic field and the long axis of the filament present in the region. The field morphology wraps around two dense molecular clumps of radii 0.34 pc and 0.22 pc and $\mathrm N(\mathrm H_2)$ = $(7.9 \pm 1.1) \times 10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$ and $(4.3 \pm 0.5) \times 10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$, respectively. The clumps are embedded in the filamentary structure and represent locally accelerated stages of mass accumulation. Gravitationally driven mass flows, largely perpendicular to the local magnetic field, produce a U-shaped field curvature across the filament axis. The plane-of-sky magnetic field strengths towards the two clumps are $ 447.91 \pm 83.81 \mu\mathrm{G}$ and $396.66 \pm 73.64 \mu\mathrm{G}$. The corresponding mass-to-flux ratios ($\lambda \sim 1.34$ and $0.82$) indicate that one clump is magnetically supercritical and the other is subcritical. The Alfven Mach numbers ($\mathcal{M}_A$) $\sim$ 0.395 and 0.393 indicate that both the clumps are in sub-Alfvénic state.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a radio-continuum survey of the LMC using the MeerKAT telescope, describe the full-Stokes products included in the first data release, and highlight some initial results. The observations are centred at 1.3 GHz with a bandwidth of 0.8 GHz. The imaging products comprise six fields of view, each encompassing $\sim$5$^\circ$ $\times$ 5$^\circ$ with the resulting images achieving a resolution of 8". The median broad-band Stokes~I image root-mean-square noise value is $\sim$11 $\mu$Jy beam$^{-1}$. The survey enables a variety of astrophysical studies, which we showcase with the presentation of a few findings. Within the LMC we identify a new supernova remnant candidate; present planetary nebulae and Wolf-Rayet stars without previous radio detections; and show the MeerKAT view of the well-known star-forming region 30 Doradus. We also present some examples of interesting foreground and background sources in the field, including the AB~Dor multiple-star system, a radio ring galaxy, a possible Odd Radio Circle, and a remarkable bent-tail radio galaxy.

 - **Abstract**
 Type Ia supernovae are bright thermonuclear explosions that are important to numerous areas of astronomy. However, the origins of these events are poorly understood. One proposed setting is that of a near Chandrasekhar mass white dwarf that undergoes runaway carbon burning in the core. During the thousand years leading up to the explosion, the white dwarf undergoes a simmering phase where slow carbon burning heats the core and drives convection. A poorly understood aspect of this phase is the convective Urca process, which links convection with weak nuclear reactions. We use the low Mach number code MAESTROeX to perform full 3D simulations as is required to accurately capture the turbulent convection. We present simulations with and without the A=23 convective Urca process, which have relaxed to a steady state. We characterize the effects of the convective Urca process on the neutrino losses, the nuclear energy generation, and the convective boundary. We find that the size of the convection zone is substantially reduced by the convective Urca process, though convection still extends past the Urca shell. Our findings on the structure of the convective zone and the compositional changes can be used to inform 1D stellar models that track the longer-timescale evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 IceCube has detected neutrino emission from the Galactic Plane (GP) at a significance of $4.5\sigma$, though its origin remains uncertain. Utilizing ten years of IceCube muon-track data, we investigate potential correlations between the GP neutrinos and $\gamma$-ray sources in the first LHAASO catalog (1LHAASO). To avoid issues caused by spectral extrapolation, this analysis focuses on sources detected by the Water Cherenkov Detector Array (WCDA). We employ an unbinned likelihood analysis to search for neutrino emission and constrain the hadronic $\gamma$-ray component of these sources. Neither single-source searches nor stacking analyses reveal significant neutrino signals. The stacking analysis indicates that the 1LHAASO WCDA population contributes at most $\sim$20\% to the diffuse GP neutrino flux measured by IceCube. The total hadronic contribution to the cumulative $\gamma$-ray emission from all WCDA sources is constrained to be at most $\sim$$60\%$, suggesting a predominantly leptonic origin for the $\gamma$-ray emission from the LHAASO source population. Even accounting for unresolved sources below the detection threshold, we estimate the total neutrino flux from all discrete sources (resolved plus unresolved) reaches at most about 40\% of the observed GP neutrino flux. These results support that the bulk of the GP neutrino emission is mainly from truly diffuse processes, i.e., cosmic-ray interactions with the interstellar medium, rather than from unresolved point sources.
#### $r$-mode stabilization in rotating hyperon-rich neutron stars and its implications for GW190814

 - **Abstract**
 The GW190814 event, involving a black hole of mass $22.2$--$24.3 M_{\odot}$ and a compact object of mass $2.50$--$2.67 M_{\odot}$, challenges our understanding of the mass gap between the heaviest neutron stars and the lightest black holes. If the secondary is a neutron star exceeding $2.5 M_{\odot}$, hyperons are likely to appear in its core, softening the equation of state. Rapid rotation can offset some of this softening, enabling higher maximum masses, but it may simultaneously excite the Chandrasekhar--Friedman--Schutz $r$-mode instability. Bulk viscosity arising from nonleptonic weak interactions in hyperonic matter provides an efficient damping mechanism that can stabilize such configurations. In this work, we investigate the combined effects of rotation, thermal evolution, and hyperon-induced bulk viscosity on the stability of massive neutron stars. We demonstrate a direct connection between the suppression of $r$-mode instabilities and the long-term dynamical stability of hyperon-rich stars, offering a plausible interpretation of the GW190814 secondary as a rapidly rotating, hyperon-rich neutron star rather than a low-mass black hole. Our unified framework extends beyond previous studies restricted to static equations of state or extreme viscous damping assumptions, providing new insights into the stability of massive, exotic neutron star configurations.

 - **Abstract**
 Dust grains and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) actively contribute to the thermodynamics, chemistry, and radiative state of the interstellar medium (ISM), yet most ISM models and galaxy simulations either exclude them altogether or adopt simplified treatments. We present CALIMA, a new module for dust and PAH formation and evolution in radiation-hydrodynamics simulations for RAMSES, designed to self-consistently couple dust physics to radiative transfer and non-equilibrium thermochemistry in a multiphase ISM. The model employs a two-size, two-composition dust framework with log-normal grain populations, explicitly evolving stellar dust injection, turbulence-informed gas-phase accretion, shattering, coagulation, thermal and non-thermal sputtering, and shock destruction, while PAHs are separate components with their own evolution. The evolving dust populations and radiation field determine local, wavelength-dependent opacities, photoelectric heating efficiencies, grain-assisted recombination, dust-gas collisional heating/cooling, and H$_2$ formation on both grains and PAHs. Updated treatments of thermal sputtering and collisional cooling that include finite grain sizes and modern ion-solid physics reduce sputtering rates at high temperatures and extend the regime where dust significantly cools hot gas. One-zone ISM tests show that dust and PAH evolution modifies classical thermal phase diagrams and C-bearing chemistry, while isolated disc galaxy simulations reveal environment-dependent variations in dust-to-metal ratio, small-to-large grain ratio, PAH fraction, and interstellar radiation field intensity that drive non-trivial structure in infrared emission, UV transparency, and H$_2$ formation. CALIMA provides a physically motivated framework to interpret dust- and PAH-based observables and to assess dust-mediated feedback in galaxy formation across cosmic time.

 - **Abstract**
 Magnetized rotating neutron stars, or pulsars, are a possible end product of massive star evolution. Their relativistic wind successively interacts with the supernova ejecta of their defunct progenitor, then with the circumstellar medium of the progenitor, and eventually with the interstellar medium. If a massive star is static with respect to its ambient medium, then its resulting circumstellar medium is elongated along the direction of the local magnetic field, and its supernova remnant transiently appears as a rectangle. The pulsar wind nebula forming in it is, in its turn, elongated, as long as the pulsar axis of rotation matches the direction of the local magnetization. In this work, we explore how the angle between the direction of the local magnetic field of the interstellar medium and the pulsar axis of rotation influences the shaping of its pulsar wind nebula with 3D MHD simulations are carried out with the PLUTO. We use those models to perform radiative transfer calculations to derive non-thermal radio emission maps of the pulsar wind nebulae. When the polar elongation of the pulsar develop, they bend in opposite directions under the effects of the cavity carved by the stellar wind and already filled by supernova ejecta. This induces a complex distribution of magnetized supernova ejecta and pulsar wind, resulting in various observable structures, appearing as rectangles, circles, or irregular oblong shapes, in the radio waveband. The angle between the direction of the pulsar rotation axis and that of the local ambient magnetization is a governing parameter for the shaping and non-thermal radio properties of the pulsar wind nebulae of static massive stars; however, the mixing of material, once the pulsar wind nebula is old (50 to 80 kyr), is not strongly affected by that factor.
#### Dynamical masses of YSOs with the VLBA: DYNAMO VLBA: Trigonometric parallaxes and proper motions of YSOs in Orion

 - **Abstract**
 We present results from a multi-epoch Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) survey of compact radio sources in the Orion complex, conducted within both the DYNAMO-VLBA and the GOBELINS projects. Our observations detected 216 compact radio sources, of which 58 yielded reliable multi-epoch astrometric solutions. For these sources, we derived trigonometric parallaxes and proper motions with typical precisions of about 0.05 mas and 0.10 mas yr$^{-1}$, respectively. The measured parallaxes range between 2.26 and 2.65 mas, corresponding to distances of 380 - 440 pc, and delineate the depth of the Orion star-forming complex. We determine mean distances of $405\pm16$ pc for NGC 2068, $403\pm5$ pc for NGC 2024, $407\pm12$ pc for the $\sigma$ Orionis region, $388.5\pm1.7$ pc for the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC), and $438\pm12$ pc for L1641. A comparison with Gaia DR3 astrometry for 28 common sources reveals negligible mean parallax offsets ($\Delta\varpi=-0.02\pm0.01$ mas) and small systematic differences in proper motions ($\sim$0.07 mas yr$^{-1}$), likely due to residual rotation of the Gaia reference frame. Our results demonstrate the capability of high-precision radio astrometry to map embedded stellar populations and to provide an independent calibration of the Gaia reference system in obscured regions.

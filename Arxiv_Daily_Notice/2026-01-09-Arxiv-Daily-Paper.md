 - **Abstract**
 The recent detection of a nanohertz stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) challenges conventional astrophysics by observed signal amplitude exceeds predictions from standard SMBHB populations without implausible accretion histories. To resolve this amplitude tension, we introduce the Radiative SIDM Dilution this http URL explain the observed spectrum emerges as a hybrid signal by an astrophysical floor, dynamically suppressed by the cored halos of Self-Interacting Dark Matter (SIDM),and a dominant cosmological peak generated during a supercooled phase transition in the dark sector. By performing a free spectral reconstruction and Bayesian model comparison, we demonstrate that a transition defined by a nucleation temperature $T_* \approx 1.24$ MeV and inverse duration $\beta/H_* \approx 150$ not only fills the spectral gap left by stalled binaries but yields statistical evidence($\Delta \text{BIC} \approx 15$) over purely standard astrophysical interpretations. The thermodynamics required to reproduce this SGWB signature also resolves the thermal overproduction of resonant SIDM. The entropy injected by the transition naturally provides the specific dilution factor $D \approx 100$ needed to reset the dark matter relic density to observation. This mechanism also has broader cosmological this http URL residual dark radiation alleviates the Hubble tension $\Delta N_{\rm eff} \sim 0.3$ while bubble collisions generate magnetohydrodynamic turbulence sufficient to seed primordial magnetic fields $B_0 \sim 10^{-13}$ G. These convergences suggest that the NANOGrav excess is not an anomaly, but the acoustic signature of the entropy injection event that rendered the dark sector cosmologically viable.

 - **Abstract**
 Tidal disruption event (TDE) light curves are increasingly used to infer the masses of quiescent supermassive black holes ($M_{\rm{BH}}$), offering a powerful probe of low-mass black hole demographics independent of host-galaxy scaling relations. However, the reliability of most semi-analytic TDE models assume full stellar disruption, despite theoretical expectations that partial disruptions dominate the TDE population. In this work we test the robustness of current TDE models using three repeating partial TDEs (rpTDEs), in which the multiple flares produced by the same surviving stellar core must yield consistent black hole masses. We present spectroscopic observations establishing AT 2023adr as a rpTDE, making it the third such spectroscopically confirmed event. We independently model the flares of the three rpTDEs; 2020vdq, 2022dbl, and 2023adr, applying fallback-accretion fits, stream-stream collision scaling relations, luminosity-based empirical relations, and cooling-envelope fits. After accounting for statistical and model-specific systematics, we find that all TDE models generally return self-consistent $M_{\rm{BH}}$ values between flares, and are broadly consistent with host-galaxy $M_{\rm{BH}}$ proxies, recovering $M_{\rm{BH}}$ to within 0.3-0.5 dex. However, the convergence of fallback models towards unphysical stellar masses and impact parameters reveals limitations in the existing fallback model grids. We also show that light curve coverage, particularly in the near-UV, is critical for constraining model parameters. This has direct implications for interpreting the thousands of TDE light curves expected from upcoming surveys such as the Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time, where from simulations, we find that $M_{\rm{BH}}$ may be underestimated on average by 0.5 dex without additional follow-up.

 - **Abstract**
 Nuclear yields are powerful probes of supernova explosions, their engines and their progenitors. In addition, as we improve our understanding of these explosions, we can use nuclear yields to probe dense matter and neutrino physics, both of which play a critical role in the central supernova engine. Especially with upcoming gamma-ray detectors that can directly detect radioactive isotopes out to increasing distances from gamma-rays emitted during their decay, nuclear yields have the potential to provide some of the most direct probes of supernova engines and stellar burning. To utilize these probes, we must understand and limit the uncertainties in their production. Uncertainties in the nuclear physics can be minimized by combining both laboratory experiments and nuclear theory. Similarly, astrophysical uncertainties caused by simplified explosion trajectories can be minimized by higher-fidelity stellar-evolution and supernova-engine models. This paper reviews the physics and astrophysics uncertainties in modeling nucleosynthetic yields, identifying the key areas of study needed to maximize the potential of supernova yields as probes of astrophysical transients and dense-matter physics.
#### Transit Photometry and Ephemeris Refinement of WASP-12 b Using TESS Data

 - **Abstract**
 We present a detailed transit photometric analysis of the ultra-hot Jupiter WASP-12 b using data from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). The study is based on publicly available calibrated light curves and target pixel files accessed through the Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes (MAST) cloud infrastructure. After extracting and normalizing the photometric time series, the light curve was phase-folded using an initial ephemeris and modeled with a physical transit model to determine the system's geometric parameters. From the transit modeling, we measure the planet-to-star radius ratio, orbital inclination, impact parameter, and transit duration. Adopting stellar parameters from the literature, we derive the planetary radius and transit depth, confirming the highly inflated nature of WASP-12 b. Individual mid-transit times were measured and used to refine the orbital ephemeris through a weighted linear fit. The resulting refined orbital period and reference epoch improve the predictive accuracy of future transit times over the TESS observational baseline. An observed-minus-calculated (O-C) analysis reveals no statistically significant transit timing variations, indicating that the timing data are consistent with a linear ephemeris within the measurement uncertainties. This work demonstrates the capability of TESS photometry to provide precise transit characterization and ephemeris refinement for well-studied exoplanet systems, and provides updated parameters that are relevant for future atmospheric and dynamical investigations of WASP-12 b.
#### Mutual Orbit Alignment in Resolved Triple Systems

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05006

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.05006

 - **Abstract**
 A sample of 278 triple systems with outer separations under 300 au and resolved inner pairs is studied, focusing on the mutual alignment between inner and outer orbits. The degree of alignment increases with (i) decreasing outer separation, (ii) decreasing ratio of outer and inner separations, (iii) decreasing mass of the inner primary component, and (iv) increasing inner mass ratio. There is no dependence on the outer mass ratio. The average mutual inclination is ~40deg for the full sample and ~10deg for 38 triples with primary components less massive than 1 solar and outer separations below 50 au. Inner eccentricities in aligned triples are smaller compared to misaligned ones. In another sample of 371 hierarchies with known outer orbits and inner eclipsing subsystems, only 22% show mutual alignment within 20deg, while the rest are aligned randomly. These findings match qualitatively current understanding of the formation of hierarchical systems, where the N-body dynamics dominates at large scales, while the accretion and migration shape systems closer than $\sim$100 au. Fragmentation of isolated cores apparently produces approximately aligned low-mass hierarchies.
#### Addressing Known Challenges in Solar Flare Forecasting I: Limb-Flare Prediction with a 4-pi Full-Heliosphere Framework

 - **Abstract**
 A demonstrated failure mode for operational solar flare forecasting is the inability to forecast flares that occur near, or just beyond, the solar limb. To address this shortcoming, we develop a "4pi" full-heliosphere event forecasting framework and evaluate its statistical classification ability against this specific challenge. A magnetic surface flux transport model is used to generate full-sun maps of the photospheric radial magnetic field from which active regions (ARs) are identified and tracked using a new labeling scheme that is observer-location agnostic and allows for post-facto modifications. Flare-relevant magnetic parameters couple to a "visibility" index that specifies AR location relative to the visible solar limb and expected flare detection. Flare labels are assigned according to peak Soft X-ray flux, and a statistical classification is performed using nonparametric discriminant analysis. A version where new or emerging ARs on the far ("invisible" side of the Sun are incorporated into the model by way of far-side helioseismology, is also tested. We evaluate the new framework by its performance specifically including the limb areas using Brier Skill Score and ROC Skill Score, finding improvement at the 2-sigma level or less. However, we do find that the number of False Negatives, or "missed" forecasts decreases, and find strong evidence that the additional information provided by the far-side helioseismology can help predict near- and just-beyond-limb flares, particularly for East-limb events. While individual components of this framework could be improved, we demonstrate that a known failure mode for solar flare forecasting can be mitigated with available resources.

 - **Abstract**
 The central molecular zone (CMZ), surrounding the Galactic centre, is the largest reservoir of dense molecular gas in the Galaxy. Despite its relative proximity, the 3D structure of the CMZ remains poorly constrained, primarily due to projection effects. We aim to constrain the line-of-sight location of two molecular clouds in the CMZ -the 50 and 20 km/s clouds- and to investigate their possible physical connection using stellar kinematics and photometry. This study serves as a pilot for future applications across the full CMZ. We estimated the line-of-sight position of the clouds by analysing stellar kinematics, stellar densities, and stellar populations towards the cloud regions and a control field. We find an absence of westward moving stars in the cloud regions, which indicates that they lie on the near side of the CMZ. This interpretation is supported by the stellar density distributions. The similar behaviour observed in the two clouds, as well as in the region between them (the ridge), suggests that they are located at comparable distances and are physically linked. We also identified an intermediate-age stellar population (2-7 Gyr) in both regions, consistent with that observed on the near side of the CMZ. We estimated the line-of-sight distances at which the clouds and the ridge become kinematically detectable (i.e. where the proper motion component parallel to the Galactic plane differs from that of the control field at the 3 sigma level) by converting their measured proper motions parallel to the Galactic plane using a theoretical model of the stellar distribution. We find that the 50 and 20 km/s clouds are located at $43\pm8$ pc and $56\pm11$ pc from Sgr A*, respectively, and that the ridge lies at $56\pm11$ pc; this supports the idea that the clouds are physically connected through the ridge.

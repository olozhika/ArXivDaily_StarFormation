 - **Abstract**
 Population III (Pop.$~$III) stars are expected to be massive and to undergo minimal mass loss due to their lack of metals, making them ideal progenitors of black holes and neutron stars. Here, we investigate the formation and properties of binary neutron star (BNS) and black hole-neutron star (BHNS) mergers originating from Pop.$~$III stars, and compare them to their metal-enriched Population II (Pop.$~$II) counterparts, focusing on their merger rate densities (MRDs), primary masses and delay times. We find that, despite the high merger efficiency of Pop.$~$III BNSs and BHNSs, their low star formation rate results in a MRD at least one order of magnitude lower than that of Pop.$~$II stars. The MRD of Pop.$~$III BNSs peaks at redshift $z\sim15$, attaining a value $\mathcal{R}_{\rm BNS}(z\sim15) \sim 15\,\rm Gpc^{-3}\,yr^{-1}$, while the MRD of Pop.$~$III BHNSs is maximum at $z\sim13$, reaching a value $\mathcal{R}_{\rm BHNS}(z\sim13) \sim 2\,\rm Gpc^{-3}\,yr^{-1}$. Finally, we observe that the black hole masses of Pop.$~$III BHNS mergers have a nearly flat distribution with a peak at $\sim 20\,\rm M_{\odot}$ and extending up to $\sim 50\,\rm M_{\odot}$. Black holes in Pop.$~$II BHNS mergers show instead a peak at $\lesssim 15\,\rm M_{\odot}$. We consider these predictions in light of recent gravitational-wave observations in the local Universe, finding that a Pop.$~$III origin is preferred relative to Pop.$~$II for some events.

 - **Abstract**
 With the combination of observations from in-situ and high-resolution remote sensing instruments, the Solar Orbiter (SolO) mission has become a particularly valuable mission for studying the inner heliosphere. With a field of view (FOV) of 40$^\circ$ to the east of the Sun, the Solar Orbiter Heliospheric Imager (SoloHI) is one of the six remote sensing instruments on board the Solar Orbiter (SolO) spacecraft. SoloHI's high-resolution imaging observations of the heliosphere and its higher cadence than previous generations of heliospheric imagers make it a perfect candidate to perform and complement studies of CMEs evolution through the heliosphere. In this work, we present the first prominence material detected by SoloHI along with other remote sensing instruments. We report that as the CME propagates out in the heliosphere, the associated filament material reaches a heliocentric height of $\sim$122.5$\,$R$_{\odot}$ ($\sim$0.57$\,$au).
#### The DORCHA suite: nature, nurture, and the phase space distribution of the Milky Way's high redshift progenitors today

 - **Abstract**
 Where in the present-day Milky Way should we search for the remnants of its earliest stars? We address this question using the DORCHA (Gaelic for Dark; DUR-uh-khuh) suite: a set of 25 high-resolution, dark-matter-only cosmological zoom-in simulations of Milky Way analogue (MWA) haloes evolved to $z=0$. Of these, 15 are isolated and the rest are in pairs, similar to the MW and M31. By identifying and tagging the most bound material in high-redshift ($z\geq5$) progenitor haloes -- those likely to host early star formation -- we track the present-day phase-space distribution of this ancient component. We find that this material is highly centrally concentrated at $z=0$, with 90 - 100 per cent residing within $r \lesssim 15\,h^{-1}\,\mathrm{kpc}$. It exhibits steep density profiles ($\rho\propto\,r^{-4}$), low velocity dispersions ($\sigma_r / \sigma_{\rm max} \lesssim 0.6$), and radially biased orbits ($\beta \gtrsim 0.5$ for $r \gtrsim 0.1\,R_{200}$), consistent with a relaxed, centrally embedded population. These results hold across haloes with diverse formation histories and environments, suggesting that the dynamical signature of early progenitors is robust to later mergers and interactions. Our findings imply that the fossil record of the first generations of stars -- including Population III and extremely metal-poor stars -- should be sought in the innermost regions of the Milky Way, where they retain distinctive kinematic imprints. While these stellar populations may overlap, we caution that low metallicity does not uniquely identify ancient stars, nor vice versa. The DORCHA suite thus provides a physically motivated baseline for interpreting observations from Galactic Archaeology surveys targeting the bulge and inner halo.
#### Structure and Magnetic Field of Bright-rimmed Cloud IC 1396E/SFO 38

 - **Abstract**
 We carried out polarimetric observations of the bright-rimmed cloud IC 1396E/SFO 38 with SCUBA-2/POL-2 to study the effect of ultraviolet (UV) light on its structure and magnetic field. This bright-rimmed cloud appears optically to be one single cloud illuminated by the UV light from the excited star of IC 1396, however our Stokes I image and 13CO(J=3-2) archival data suggest that this cloud is not a simple, single structure, but appears to be composed of two parts on first glance; a head part with wings and a tail, and a north-west extension this http URL molecular clouds are generally filamentary and it seems likely that the initial structures of bright-rimmed clouds are expected to be also generally elongated, we examined the possibility that the structure was created from a single elongated cloud by the UV impact. We compared the cloud structure with a simulation study that investigated the evolution of prolate clouds exposed to the UV radiation from various directions and found that this apparent two-part structure could be reproduced in a situation where a single filamentary cloud is obliquely illuminated by UV light. The magnetic field directions of the cloud are different from the ambient field direction, demonstrating the field reconfiguration due to the UV impact. The distortion or pinch of the magnetic field is seen toward the cloud head, where an intermediate-mass star cluster is located, suggesting gravitational contraction. We roughly estimated the magnetic strength and stability in three parts of the cloud and found that the cloud head is most likely to be supercritical.

 - **Abstract**
 Computational astrochemical models are essential for helping us interpret and understand the observations of different astrophysical environments. In the age of high-resolution telescopes such as JWST and ALMA, the substructure of many objects can be resolved, raising the need for astrochemical modeling at these smaller scales, meaning that the simulations of these objects need to include both the physics and chemistry to accurately model the observations. The computational cost of the simulations coupling both the three-dimensional hydrodynamics and chemistry is enormous, creating an opportunity for surrogate models that can effectively substitute the chemical solver. In this work we present surrogate models that can replace the original chemical code, namely Latent Augmented Neural Ordinary Differential Equations. We train these surrogate architectures on three datasets of increasing physical complexity, with the last dataset derived directly from a three-dimensional simulation of a molecular cloud using a Photodissociation Region (PDR) code, 3D-PDR. We show that these surrogate models can provide speedup and reproduce the original observable column density maps of the dataset. This enables the rapid inference of the chemistry (on the GPU), allowing for the faster statistical inference of observations or increasing the resolution in hydrodynamical simulations of astrophysical environments.

 - **Abstract**
 The dense cores of Milky Way globular clusters (GCs) play host to a variety of dynamical encounters between stellar objects, which can accelerate stars to velocities high enough to escape the GC. The most extreme examples of these encounters are interactions between single GC stars and binaries including at least one compact object. These interactions can result in ejection velocities of up to several hundred $\mathrm{km \ s^{-1}}$, approaching or even exceeding the escape velocity of the Galaxy itself. In order to study whether these interactions contribute to the Galactic population of hypervelocity stars (stars moving faster than the Galactic escape speed), we combine Monte Carlo $N$-body GC simulations, observations of Galactic GCs, and a particle spray code to generate realistic populations of stars which have escaped from Milky Way GCs following star + compact object binary (S+COB) interactions. We find that over the last 500 Myr, S+COB interactions have likely ejected $\sim$6300 stars from Galactic GCs, of which $839_{-67}^{+70}$ have present-day velocities exceeding $500 \; \mathrm{km \ s^{-1}}$. Using mock photometric observations, we find that $290_{-23}^{+28}$ ejected stars are detectable in Gaia Data Release 3, however, only $1_{-1}^{+2}$ stars faster than $500 \; \mathrm{km \ s^{-1}}$ are detectable. Even so, we show that observational prospects in the upcoming Legacy Survey of Space and Time are more optimistic, and future detected fast extratidal GC stars will serve as a useful probe of GC cores.

 - **Abstract**
 Studying the diffuse Galactic synchrotron emission (hereafter, DGSE) at arc-minute angular scale is important to remove the foregrounds for the cosmological 21-cm observations. Statistical measurements of the large-scale DGSE can also be used to constrain the magnetic field and the cosmic ray electron density of our Galaxy's interstellar medium (ISM). Here, we have used the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) drift scan observations at $154.2 \, {\rm MHz}$ to measure the angular power spectrum $({\cal C}_{\ell})$ of the DGSE of a region of the sky from right ascension (RA) $349^{\circ}$ to $70.3^{\circ}$ at the fixed declination $-26.7^{\circ}$. In this RA range, we have chosen 24 pointing centers (PCs), for which we have removed all the bright point sources above $\sim430 \, {\rm mJy}\,(3\sigma)$, and applied the Tapered Gridded Estimator (TGE) on residual data to estimate the ${\cal C}_{\ell}$. We use the angular multipole range $65 \le \ell \le 650$ to fit the data with a model, ${\cal C}^M_{\ell}=A\times \left(\frac{1000}{\ell}\right)^{\beta}+C$, where we interpret the model as the combination of a power law $(\propto \ell^{-\beta})$ nature of the DGSE and a constant part due to the Poisson fluctuations of the residual point sources. We are able to fit the model ${\cal C}^M_{\ell}$ for six PCs centered at $\alpha=352.5^{\circ}, 353^{\circ}, 357^{\circ}, 4.5^{\circ}, 4^{\circ}$ and $1^{\circ}$. We run the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) ensemble sampler to get the best-fit values of the parameters $A, \beta$ and $C$ for these PCs. We see that the values of $A$ vary in the range $155$ to $400$ mK$^{2}$, whereas the $\beta$ varies in the range $0.9$ to $1.7$. We find that the value of $\beta$ is consistent at $2-\sigma$ level with the earlier measurement of the DGSE at similar frequency and angular scales.

 - **Abstract**
 The stability of the heliopause, the tangential discontinuity separating the solar wind from the interstellar medium, is influenced by various processes, including the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. This study investigates the role of charge exchange collisions between protons and hydrogen (H) atoms in reduction of the Kelvin-Helmholtz growth rate at the heliopause. Using a two-dimensional gasdynamic model with the inclusion of H atoms, we perform numerical simulations of the plasma flow near the heliopause flanks. We conduct a parametric study by varying the Knudsen number. Our results indicate that charge exchange collisions play a crucial role in suppressing the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. As the Knudsen number decreases, the flow transitions from an unstable regime to a smoother state.

 - **Abstract**
 Diffuse Interstellar Bands (DIBs) are crucial tracers of the interstellar medium (ISM), yet their carriers remain poorly understood. While large-scale surveys have advanced DIB studies in cool stellar spectra, measurements in hot stellar spectra are still limited. Using 287 277 high signal-to-noise (S/N $>$ 50) hot stellar spectra from the tenth data release of the Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope low-resolution spectroscopic survey (LAMOST LRS DR10), we systematically measured the three prominent optical DIBs at 5780, 5797, and 6614 Å. We published three catalogs containing 285 103, 279 195, and 281 146 valid measurements for the DIBs at 5780, 5797, and 6614 Å, respectively. Among them, 112 479, 25 232, and 71 048 are high-quality samples after rigorous quality control. To our knowledge, these are the largest hot-star DIB datasets in the northern sky. The catalogs provide spectral metadata, added astrometeric information, DIB profiles, and quality metrics. Our methodology and open-source pipeline ensure reproducibility, while the scale and precision of the data support future statistical studies. We anticipate that these catalogs will highlight the LAMOST's role in advancing DIB research and deepening our understanding of the ISM.

 - **Abstract**
 Free-floating planetary mass objects-worlds that roam interstellar space untethered to a parent star-challenge conventional notions of planetary formation and migration, but also of star and brown dwarf formation. We focus on the multiplicity among free-floating planets. By virtue of their low binding energy (compared to other objects formed in these environments), these low-mass substellar binaries represent a most sensitive probe of the mechanisms at play during the star formation process. We use the Hubble Space Telescope and its Wide Field Camera 3 and the Very Large Telescope and its ERIS adaptive optics facility to search for visual companions among a sample of 77 objects members of the Upper Scorpius and Taurus young nearby associations with estimated masses in the range between approximately 5-33 M$_{\rm Jup}$. We report the discovery of one companion candidate around a Taurus member with a separation of 111.9$\pm$0.4 mas, or $\sim$18 au assuming a distance of 160pc, with an estimated primary mass in the range between 3-6 M$_{\rm Jup}$ and a secondary mass between 2.6-5.2 M$_{\rm Jup}$, depending on the assumed age. This corresponds to an overall binary fraction of 1.8$^{+2.6}_{-1.3}$% among free-floating planetary mass objects over the separation range $\ge$7 au. Despite the limitations of small-number statistics and variations in spatial resolution and sensitivity, our results, combined with previous high-spatial-resolution surveys, suggest a notable difference in the multiplicity properties of objects below $\sim$25 M$_{\rm Jup}$ between Upper Sco and Taurus. In Taurus, five companions were identified among 78 observed objects (4.9$^{+2.8}_{-2.0}$%), whereas none were found among 97 objects in Upper Sco ($\le$1.2%).}
#### Protostellar disks in their natural habitat -- the formation of protostars and their accretion disks in the turbulent and magnetized interstellar medium

 - **Abstract**
 We present simulations of the supernova-driven turbulent interstellar medium (ISM) in a simulation domain of volume $(256\,{\rm pc})^3$ within which we resolve the formation of protostellar accretion disks and their stellar cores to spatial scales of $\sim 10^{-4}$ au, using the moving-mesh code {\small AREPO}. We perform simulations with no magnetic fields, ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) and ambipolar diffusion, and compare the resulting first Larson cores and their associated structures, including the accretion disks, their location within the larger-scale structure and the streamers connecting these. We find that disks of sizes $10-100\,{\rm au}$ form early in the simulations without magnetic fields, while there are no disks larger than 10 au with ideal MHD. Ambipolar diffusion causes large disks to form in a subset of cases (two out of six cores), and generally reduces the strength of outflows, which are seen to play a central role. When they are able to carry away significant angular momentum, they prevent the formation of a rotationally supported disk. Magnetic fields strengths grow from $0.1 - 1$ mG in the protostellar core to more than 10 G in the first Larson core in all simulations with ideal MHD. The rotationally supported disks which form can have rotation speeds $> 1$ km s$^{-1}$ even out to further than 100 au from the centre, become gravitationally unstable and form complex spiral substructures with Toomre $Q < 1$. We conclude that the impact of magnetic fields and non-ideal MHD on the formation of protostellar disks is substantial in realistic formation scenarios from the turbulent ISM.
#### FAST Pulsar Database: II. Scattering profiles of 122 Pulsars

 - **Abstract**
 The turbulent ionized interstellar medium diffracts radio waves and makes them propagate in multiple paths. The pulse-broadening observed at low frequencies results from the scattering effect of interstellar clouds of ionized gas. During the Galactic Plane Pulsar Snapshot (GPPS) survey and other projects by using the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST), we detect the pulse-broadening for 122 pulsars in the radio frequency band between 1.0 and 1.5 GHz, including 60 newly discovered pulsars in the GPPS survey and 62 previously known pulsars. We find that a more accurate dispersion measure can be obtained from aligning the front edge of the scattered subband pulses at the 1/4 or 1/2 peak level for most pulsars with one dominant component in the intrinsic profile, and the best DM values from aligning the intrinsic profile components from the model-fitting. From the pulse profiles at a few subbands we derive the pulse-broadening timescale and the scattering spectral index. These scattering parameters are measured for the first time for 93 pulsars. For 29 pulsars with previously detected scattering features, our measurements of the pulse-broadening timescale are consistent with results in the literature. We find that pulsars behind spiral arms show a stronger scattering effect due to greater density fluctuations in the arm regions. With a properly derived dispersion measure and careful calibration, we also present polarization profiles for 41 pulsars in three subbands of FAST observations.

 - **Abstract**
 The heating of a molecular cloud by photons emitted by a primary black hole (PBH) located inside the cloud is considered. For graphite and silicate dust particles, the dependence of dust temperature on the distance from PBH is derived, along with the emission spectrum of dust particles. The obtained spectrum is compared with the sensitivity of the Millimetron Space Observatory for various values of concentration and size of dust particles and different PBH masses.
#### On the accretion luminosity of Class I protostars

 - **Abstract**
 The value of the accretion luminosity during the early phases of star formation is a crucial information which helps us understand how stars form, yet it is still very difficult to obtain. We develop a new methodology to measure accretion luminosity using mid-infrared hydrogen recombination lines, and apply it to a limited sample of Class~I protostars in the Taurus and Ophiuchus star forming regions. We adopt the commonly used assumption that the properties of disk-protostar accretion in Class I objects is similar to the disk-star accretion in Class II objects. Using simultaneous observations of three hydrogen recombination lines Brg, Pfg, and Bra, we derive the mean intrinsic line ratios, and we verified that these are constant across the probed range of photospheric and accretion properties. We establish correlations between the line luminosities and accretion luminosity. We measure the extinction towards the line emission regions in Class I protostars comparing the observed line ratios to the Class II mean values. We then derive the Class I accretion luminosities from the established Class II correlations. We find that the accretion luminosity dominates the bolometric luminosity for the more embedded protostars, corresponding to lower values of the bolometric temperature. As the bolometric temperature increases above ~700K, there is a sharp drop of the contribution of the accretion from the bolometric luminosity. Our finding are in qualitative agreement with numerical simulations of star formation. We suggest that this methodology should be applied to larger and more statistically significant samples of Class I objects, for a more detailed comparison. Our results also suggest that by combining multiple infrared line ratios, it will be possible to derive a more detailed description of the dust extinction law in protostellar envelopes.

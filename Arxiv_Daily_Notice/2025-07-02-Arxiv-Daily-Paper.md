#### Energy-Dependent Transport of Cosmic Rays in the Multiphase, Dynamic Interstellar Medium

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the transport of spectrally resolved cosmic ray (CR) protons with kinetic energies between $1-100$ GeV within the dynamic, multiphase interstellar medium (ISM), using a two-moment CR fluid solver applied to a TIGRESS MHD simulation with conditions similar to the solar neighborhood. Our CR transport prescription incorporates space- and momentum-dependent CR scattering coefficients $\sigma=\kappa^{-1}$, computed from the local balance between streaming-driven Alfvèn wave growth and damping processes. We find that advection combines with momentum-dependent diffusion to produce a CR distribution function $f(p)\propto~p^{-\gamma}$ with $\gamma\approx4.6$ that agrees with observations, steepened from an injected power law slope $\gamma_\mathrm{inj}=4.3$. The CR pressure is uniform in the highly diffusive, mostly neutral midplane region, but decreases exponentially in the ionized extraplanar region where scattering is efficient. To interpret these numerical results, we develop a two-zone analytic model that captures and links the two (physically and spatially) distinct regimes of CR transport in the multiphase, dynamic ISM. At low momenta, CR transport is dominated by gas advection, while at high momenta, both advection and diffusion contribute. At high momentum, the analytic prediction for the spectral slope approaches $\gamma=(4/3)\gamma_\mathrm{inj}-1$, and the predicted scaling of grammage with momentum is $X\propto p^{1-\gamma_\mathrm{inj}/3}$, consistent with the simulations. These results support a physical picture in which CRs are confined within the neutral midplane by the surrounding ionized gas, with their escape regulated by both the CR scattering rate in the ionized extraplanar gas and the velocity and Alfvén speed of that gas, at effective speed $v_\mathrm{c,eff}\approx(1/2)[\kappa_\parallel~d(v+v_\mathrm{A,i})/dz]^{1/2}$.
#### DeepCHART: Mapping the 3D dark matter density field from Ly$α$ forest surveys using deep learning

 - **Abstract**
 We present DeepCHART (Deep learning for Cosmological Heterogeneity and Astrophysical Reconstruction via Tomography), a deep learning framework designed to reconstruct the three-dimensional dark matter density field at redshift $z=2.5$ from Ly$\alpha$ forest spectra. Leveraging a 3D variational autoencoder with a U-Net architecture, DeepCHART performs fast, likelihood-free inference, accurately capturing the non-linear gravitational dynamics and baryonic processes embedded in cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. When applied to joint datasets combining Ly$\alpha$ forest absorption and coeval galaxy positions, the reconstruction quality improves further. For current surveys, such as Subaru/PFS, CLAMATO, and LATIS, with an average transverse sightline spacing of $d_\perp=2.4h^{-1}$cMpc, DeepCHART achieves high-fidelity reconstructions over the density range $0.4<\Delta_{\rm DM}<15$, with a voxel-wise Pearson correlation coefficient of $\rho\simeq 0.77$. These reconstructions are obtained using Ly$\alpha$ forest spectra with signal-to-noise ratios as low as 2 and instrumental resolution $R=2500$, matching Subaru/PFS specifications. For future high-density surveys enabled by instruments such as ELT/MOSAIC and WST/IFS with $d_\perp\simeq 1h^{-1}\mathrm{cMpc}$, the correlation improves to $\rho\simeq 0.90$ across a wider dynamic range ($0.25<\Delta_{\rm DM}<40$). The framework reliably recovers the dark matter density PDF as well as the power spectrum, with only mild suppression at intermediate scales. In terms of cosmic web classification, DeepCHART successfully identifies 81% of voids, 75% of sheets, 63% of filaments, and 43% of nodes. We propose DeepCHART as a powerful and scalable framework for field-level cosmological inference, readily generalisable to other observables, and offering a robust, efficient means of maximising the scientific return of upcoming spectroscopic surveys.
#### Metal-poor single Wolf-Rayet stars: the interplay of optically thick winds and rotation

 - **Abstract**
 The Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) hosts 12 known Wolf-Rayet stars (WRs), seven of which apparently single. Their formation is a challenge for current stellar evolution models, because line-driven winds are generally assumed to be quenched at a metallicity Z<0.004. Here, we present a set of MESA models of single stars with zero-age main sequence masses 20-80 M_sun, considering different initial rotation speeds (Omega=0-0.7 Omega_c), metallicities (Z=0.002-0.0045), and wind mass-loss models (optically thin and thick winds). We show that if we account for optically thick winds, as described by Sabhahit+2023, fast rotating (Omega=0.6 Omega_c) single metal-poor O-type stars (with M>20 M_sun) shed their envelope and become WR stars even at the low metallicity of the SMC. The luminosity, effective temperature, evolutionary timescale, surface abundance, and rotational velocity of our simulated WR stars are compatible to the WRs observed in the SMC. We speculate that this scenario can also alleviate the excess of giant stars across the Humphreys-Davidson limit. Our results have key implications for black hole masses, (pair instability) supernova explosions, and other observable signatures.

 - **Abstract**
 We model the transport and spectral evolution of 1-100 GeV cosmic ray (CR) electrons (CREs) in TIGRESS MHD simulations of the magnetized, multiphase interstellar medium. We post-process a kpc-sized galactic disk patch representative of the solar neighborhood using a two-moment method for CR transport that includes advection, streaming, and diffusion. The diffusion coefficient is set by balancing wave growth via the CR streaming instability against wave damping (nonlinear Landau and ion-neutral collisions), depending on local gas and CR properties. Implemented energy loss mechanisms include synchrotron, inverse Compton, ionization, and bremsstrahlung. We evaluate CRE losses by different mechanisms as a function of energy and distance from the midplane, and compare loss timescales to transport and diffusion timescales. This comparison shows that CRE spectral steepening above p = 1 GeV/c is due to a combination of energy-dependent transport and losses. Our evolved CRE spectra are consistent with direct observations in the solar neighborhood, with a spectral index that steepens from an injected value of -2.3 to an energy dependent value between -2.7 and -3.3. We also show that the steepening is independent of the injection spectrum. Finally, we present potential applications of our models, including to the production of synthetic synchrotron emission. Our simulations demonstrate that the CRE spectral slope can be accurately recovered from pairs of radio observations in the range 1.5-45 GHz.
#### Fuzzy dark matter halos with repulsive self-interactions: coherent soliton and halo vortex network with moderate self-coupling

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.00293

 - **Abstract**
 We examine the impact of repulsive self-interactions of moderate strength on fuzzy dark matter halos focusing on the core and granule size, the spatial dependence of the field's coherence, the turbulent vortex tangle and the oscillation frequency of the central soliton. Our analysis extends across the range from quantum-pressure-dominated to self-interaction-dominated stabilisation of the gravitationally bound solitonic core. Within this examined range of self-coupling strengths, we find that mergers with a given initial spatial configuration and an increasing self-interaction strength $g$, result in cores with increased size that exhibit a reduced central density and oscillate with decreased frequency. All of these features are in accordance with expectations from the study of isolated Self-interacting Fuzzy Dark Matter (SFDM) solitons. The characteristic size of the granules in the surrounding halo also grows but by a much smaller amount relative to the core; accordingly, typical inter-vortex distances are also only mildly affected. We also measure the total length of the vortex network which, although less robust, shows no clear dependence on increasing $g$ and no signs of decay over the timescales of our simulations. Measures of coherence of the field behave as in the non-interacting case, again clearly separating the coherent core form the quasi-coherent halo. Interestingly, we observe a relative increase of incoherent fluctuations coexisting with the coherent mode at the centre of the halo with increasing self-coupling strength, a phenomenon also observed in laboratory condensates at non-zero temperature.
#### Exploring the probing power of gamma-Dor's inertial dip for core magnetism: case of a toroidal field

 - **Abstract**
 Gamma-Dor stars are ideal targets for studies of stellar innermost dynamical properties due to their rich asteroseismic spectrum of gravity modes. Integrating internal magnetism to the picture appears as the next milestone of detailed asteroseismic studies, for its prime importance on stellar evolution. The inertial dip in prograde dipole modes period-spacing pattern of gamma-Dors stands out as a unique window on the convective core structure and dynamics. Recent studies have highlighted the dependence of the dip structure on core density stratification, contrast of the near-core Brunt-Väisälä frequency and rotation rate, as well as the core-to-near-core differential rotation. In the meantime, the effect of magnetism has been derived on envelope modes. We aim to revisit the inertial dip formation including core and envelope magnetism, and explore the probing power of this feature on dynamo-generated core fields. We consider a toroidal magnetic field with a bi-layer (core and envelope) Alfvén frequency. This configuration allows us to revisit the coupling problem using our knowledge on both core magneto-inertial modes and envelope magneto-gravito-inertial modes. We stay in an analytical framework to exhibit the magnetic effects on the inertial dip shape and location, setting up a laboratory towards the comprehension of magnetic effects on the dip structure. We show a shift of the inertial dip towards lower spin parameter values and a thinner dip with increasing core magnetic field, quite similar to the signature of differential rotation. The magnetic effects become sizeable when the ratio between the magnetic and the Coriolis effects is large enough. We explore the degeneracy of the magnetic effects with differential rotation. We study the detectability of core magnetism, considering observational constraints on the modes periods and potential gravito-inertial mode suppression.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the results of astrochemical modeling of complex organic molecules (COMs) in the ice and gas of the prestellar core L1544 with the recently updated MONACO rate equations-based model. The model includes, in particular, non-diffusive processes, new laboratory verified chemical routes for acetaldehyde and methane ice formation and variation of H and $\rm H_2$ desorption energies depending on the surface coverage by $\rm H_2$ molecules. For the first time, we simultaneously reproduce the abundances of several oxygen-bearing COMs in the gas phase, the approximate location of the peak of methanol emission, as well as the abundance of methanol in the icy mantles of L1544. Radical-radical reactions on grains surface between species such as $\rm CH_3$, $\rm CH_3O$ and $\rm HCO$ efficiently proceed non-diffusively. COMs are delivered to the gas phase via chemical desorption amplified by the loops of H-addition/abstraction surface reactions. However, gas-phase chemical reactions as well provide a noticeable input to the formation of COMs in the gas, but not to the COMs solid-state abundances. This particularly applies for CH$_3$CHO and CH$_3$OCH$_3$. The simulated abundances of COMs in the ice are in the range 1\%--2\% (for methyl formate ice) or $\sim$~0.1\% (for CH$_3$CHO and CH$_3$OCH$_3$) with respect to the abundance of H$_2$O ice. We stress a similarity between the simulated abundances of icy COMs in L1544 and the abundances of COMs in the gas phase of hot cores/corinos. We compare our non-diffusive model with the diffusive model and provide constraints for the species' diffusion-to-desorption energy ratios.
#### Dark from light (DfL): Inferring halo properties from luminous tracers with machine learning trained on cosmological simulations. I. Method, proof of concept & preliminary testing

 - **Abstract**
 We present Dark from Light (DfL) - a novel method to infer the dark sector in wide-field galaxy surveys, leveraging a machine learning approach trained on contemporary cosmological simulations. The aim of this algorithm is to provide a fast, straightforward, and accurate route to estimating dark matter halo masses and group membership in wide-field spectroscopic galaxy surveys. This approach requires a highly limited number of input parameters and yields full probability distribution functions for the output halo masses. To achieve this, we train a series of Random Forest (RF) regression models on the IllustrisTNG and EAGLE simulations at z=0-3, which provide model-dependent mappings from luminous tracers to dark matter halo properties. We incorporate the individual regression models into a virial group-finding algorithm (DfL), which outputs halo properties for observational-like input data. We test the method at z=0-2 for both the EAGLE and IllustrisTNG models, as well as in a cross-validation mode. We demonstrate that known halo masses can be recovered with a mean systematic bias of $\langle b \rangle = \pm 0.10\,$dex (resulting from simulation choice), a mean statistical uncertainty of $\langle \sigma \rangle = 0.12 \,$dex across epochs, and a central - (core) satellite classification accuracy of 96%. We establish that this approach yields superior halo mass recovery to standard abundance matching applied to groups identified through a friends-of-friends algorithm. Additionally, we compare the outputs of DfL to observational constraints on the $M_* - M_{\rm Halo}$ relation from strong gravitational lensing at $z \sim 0$, demonstrating the promise of this novel approach. Finally, we systematically quantify how DfL performs on observational-like input data with varying stellar mass uncertainty and spectroscopic incompleteness, enabling robust error calibration.

 - **Abstract**
 [Abridged] The physical conditions in stellar atmospheres can be obtained from the interpretation of solar spectro-polarimetric observations. However, traditional inversion codes are computationally demanding, especially for lines whose formation is complex. The necessity of faster alternatives has motivated the emergence of machine learning solutions. This paper introduces an approach to the inversion and synthesis of Stokes profiles inspired by neural machine translation. Our aim is to develop a generative model that treats Stokes profiles and atmospheric models as two distinct ``languages'' encoding the same physical reality. We build a model that learns how to translate between them, also providing estimates of the uncertainty. We employ a tokenization strategy for both Stokes parameters and model atmospheres, which is learned using a VQ-VAE, a neural model used to compress the data into a lower dimensionality form. The core of our inversion code utilizes a transformer encoder-decoder architecture to perform the translation between these tokenized representations. The model is trained on a database of synthetic Stokes profiles derived from perturbations to various semi-empirical solar atmospheric models, ensuring a wide range of expected solar physical conditions. The method effectively reconstructs atmospheric models from observed Stokes profiles, showing better constrained models within the region of sensitivity of the considered spectral lines. The latent representation induced by the VQ-VAE helps accelerate the inversion by compressing the length of the Stokes profiles and model atmospheres. Additionally, it helps regularize the solution by reducing the chances of obtaining unphysical models. As a final advantage, the method provides the generative nature of our model, which naturally yields an estimate of the uncertainty in the solution.

 - **Abstract**
 Ultralight dark matter refers to the lightest potential dark matter candidates. We will focus on the mass range that has been studied using astrophysical and cosmological observations, corresponding to a mass $10^{-24} \, \mathrm{eV} \lesssim m \lesssim 10^{-18} \, \mathrm{eV}$. We will discuss the motivations for this mass range. The most studied model in this range corresponds to a minimally coupled, single, classical, spin-0 field comprising all dark matter. However, the work exploring extensions of this model (for example, higher spin, self-coupled, multiple field, and mixed models) will be one of the focuses of this review. The phenomenology associated with ultralight dark matter is rich and includes linear effects on the primordial power spectrum, core structures forming at the center of halos, nonlinear effects resulting in heating of stellar distributions, and non-relativistic effects relating to pulsar signals and black hole superradiance, to name a few. This set of effects has been studied using an equally extensive set of numerical tools. We will summarize the most common ones and discuss their applications and limitations. Ultralight dark matter also has a wide variety of observational constraints, including halo mass functions, the Lyman-alpha forest, halo density profiles, stellar dynamics, and black hole spins. We will review them focusing on the observations made, the method of study, and the major systematics. We will end with a discussion of the current status of the field and future work needed.
#### Attributing the point symmetric structure of core-collapse supernova remnant N132D to the jittering jets explosion mechanism

 - **Abstract**
 I identified a point-symmetric morphology in the core-collapse supernova (CCSN) remnant (CCSNR) N132D, composed of two symmetry axes: the short symmetry axis extending from the northwest ear and through the center of the iron-rich emission on the other side, and the second along the long dimension of N132D and coincides with the extension of the central oxygen-rich gas to the northeast. Namely, the point-symmetry of the outer zones of CCSNR N132D correlates with that of the oxygen-rich gas near the center. The surrounding gas cannot shape the inner oxygen-rich material, implying that the point-symmetric morphology is a property of the explosion mechanism, as predicted by the jittering jets explosion mechanism (JJEM). The oxygen-rich material is known to be in a torus. According to the JJEM, an energetic pair of opposite jets, more or less perpendicular to the plane of the torus, has shaped the torus; this pair is along the short symmetry axis. Another energetic pair, perpendicular to the first one, shaped the elongated, large-scale structure of CCSNR N132D. I discuss how the JJEM accounts for two perpendicular pairs of jets and the unequal jets in each pair. CCSNR N132D is the fifteenth CCSNR with an identified point-symmetric morphology attributed to the JJEM. Because the neutrino-driven mechanism cannot explain such morphologies, this study further strengthens the claim that the JJEM is the primary explosion mechanism of CCSNe.
#### Microlensing of dark matter models in the Milky Way

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate constraints on the abundance of primordial black holes (PBHs) as dark matter (DM) candidates using five years of microlensing data from the OGLE survey. While the majority of OGLE's $\sim 2000$ microlensing events are well-explained by stellar populations such as brown dwarfs, main-sequence stars, and compact remnants, a subset of six ultrashort-timescale events ($t_E \sim 0.1 - 0.3$ days) may signal the presence of PBHs. Building upon prior work that adopted the Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) DM profile, we examine how alternative DM halo models -- specifically the Einasto and Burkert profiles -- affect microlensing predictions and the constraints on PBH abundance. We computed differential microlensing event rates for both profiles, using the main-sequence star rate as an observational benchmark. Our results show that neither the Einasto nor Burkert profiles reproduce the distribution of main-sequence star events, yet both allow for viable explanations of the ultrashort-timescale events with PBH masses $M_{\mathrm{PBH}} \sim 10^{-5} M_\odot$. Using a Poisson likelihood analysis under the null hypothesis that no PBH is observed in OGLE dataset, we derive 95\% C.L. upper bounds on $f_{\mathrm{PBH}}$, finding that the constraints are significantly relaxed under the Einasto and Burkert profiles compared to the NFW case. These results underscore the sensitivity of PBH constraints to the assumed DM halo structure and highlight the importance of accurately modeling the inner Galactic density profile to robustly assess PBH dark matter scenarios.
#### Is $ω_0 ω_a$CDM a good model for the clumpy Universe?

 - **Abstract**
 The DESI collaboration just obtained a set of precise BAO measurements, that combined with CMB and SNIa datasets show that the $\omega_0 \omega_a$CDM model is preferred over $\Lambda$CDM, at more than $4\,\sigma$, to describe the dynamics of the expanding Universe. This raises the question whether this model also suitably describes the clumpy Universe. Also lately, detailed analyses of diverse cosmic tracers resulted in a new dataset of measurements of an observable from the clumpy Universe: $\sigma_8(z)$, spanning a high-redshift data $z \in [0.013, 3.8]$. In this work we use this dataset of 15 $\sigma_8(z_i)$ measurements to study the viability of the $\omega_0 \omega_a$CDM cosmological model to explain the clustered Universe. Our analyses compare the $\omega_0 \omega_a$CDM model with the $\sigma_8(z)$ function reconstructed from the data points using Gaussian Process. Moreover, we perform a similar evaluation of the $\Lambda$CDM model considering Planck and~DESI best-fit parameters. In addition, we implemented robustness tests regarding Gaussian Process reconstruction to support our results.

 - **Abstract**
 The Carina Nebula is an active star-forming region with several open clusters rich in massive OB stars, thus making it an optimal target for studying stellar properties such as rotation for large samples of these early-type stars. We studied a sample of early-type stars probable members of the 8 open clusters in the Carina Complex. The observational data consist of high-resolution spectra from the Gaia-ESO public Spectroscopic Survey. Astrometric and photometric data from Gaia EDR3 and radial velocities measured from the observed spectra are used to confirm the cluster members. The projected rotational velocities of 330 early-type stars of Carina are derived from the widths of \ion{He}{i} lines at 4388 and 4471 Å. The reported \Vsini\ values are the first estimates for 222 early-type stars. The \Vsini\ distribution for the Carina clusters peaks at $\sim$100-150 \kms, consistent with the distributions for B stars in Galactic clusters. \Vsini\ estimates for stars members of the clusters Trumpler 15, Collinder 228, Collinder 232, and Bochum 11 are presented for the first time in the literature. For a subsample of stars with earlier spectral types from B0 to B3, we find a bimodal distribution, with a third, small peak towards the upper values of \Vsini. When the full sample is split according to the parent cluster, we find that the oldest cluster in our sample, NGC 3293, presents a higher concentration of rapidly rotating stars. In contrast, Collinder 228 presents a larger number of stars with lower \Vsini.

 - **Abstract**
 Star cluster formation and assembly occurs inside filamentary and turbulent molecular clouds, which imprints both spatial and kinematic substructure on the young cluster. In this paper, we quantify the amount and evolution of this substructure in simulations of star cluster formation that include radiation magnetohydrodynamical evolution of the gas, coupled with detailed stellar dynamics, binary formation and evolution, and stellar feedback. We find that both spatial and kinematic substructure are present at early times. Both are erased as the cluster assembles through the formation of new stars as well as the merger of sub-clusters. Spatial substructure is erased over a timescale of approximately 2.5 times the initial free-fall time of the cloud. Kinematic substructure persists for longer, and is still present to the end of our simulations. We also explored our simulations for evidence of early dynamical mass segregation, and conclude that the presence of a population of binary stars can accelerate and enhance the mass segregation process.

 - **Abstract**
 Carbon dioxide is one of the three most abundant species within the ice mantles around dust grains inside molecular clouds. Since a substantial amount of interstellar grains is made of siliceous materials, we have studied the infrared profile of CO2 deposited on top of a bare and ice-coated amorphous silicate (MgFeSiO4) film using reflection absorption infrared spectroscopy (RAIRS). In contrast to a metal surface, the CO2 IR profile shows a relaxation of the metal surface selection rule in the presence of the bare MgFeSiO4 dust grain analog, which brings the IR profile closer to the observational spectra while maintaining the sensitivity of RAIRS. Experiments with the underlying CO and CH4 ices show that their presence facilitates structural changes toward crystalline ice for the deposited CO2 at much lower temperatures than on the polar ice layers. Warming-up experiments of CO2 showed that it tends to stay on the silicate surface for much longer than on the gold surface without the silicate layer. We noticed for the first time a split in the 13CO2 IR feature on the pure or ice-covered silicate grain as a marker for the onset of diffusion. The laboratory 13CO2 profile then closely resembles recent JWST observations of this feature around young and embedded protostars, suggesting that it can be linked to the observed feature.

 - **Abstract**
 In star-forming regions, molecular cloud history and dynamics set the trend in the chemical composition. Ice formation, in particular, is affected by the evolution of physical conditions, which can lead to different ice compositions within the same cloud. In cold cores with medium densities >1e4 cm-3, low temperatures <15 K, and low UV radiation <G0, most COMs are formed on dust grain surfaces and are released back into the gas phase through non-thermal mechanisms. Studying both gas- and solid-phases can help observers to add constraints on the chemical and dynamical evolution of cold cores. We present a study of the cold core L694, observed with the IRAM 30m telescope. Observed species include CO (and its isotopologues) and CH3OH. We applied an inverted non-LTE radiative transfer code in order to obtain gas-phase abundances by deriving the column densities of the detected species from the spectroscopic parameters of the targeted molecular transitions, and from physical parameters derived from archival observations. This allowed us to probe the molecular abundances as a function of density and visual extinction. In parallel, we ran chemical models (both static and dynamic) to constrain the evolution time of the core by directly comparing the observations with the model outputs. We then compared the compositions of the cold cores L429-C and L694. The gas-phase abundances in L694 all exhibit a common depletion profile (with high variability in the depletion factor), as the core is identified to be in a more advanced (infalling) state compared to L429-C. The physical parameters of the two cores are, however, very similar, leading to close evolutionary timescales in our static models. The dynamical model fails to reproduce the CO gas-phase abundances at high density, predicting an evolutionary timescale that is too short compared to static models.

 - **Abstract**
 The existence of billion-solar-mass quasars at redshifts $z \gtrsim 7$ poses a formidable challenge to theories of black hole formation, requiring pathways for the rapid growth of massive seeds. Population III.1 stars, forming in pristine, dense dark matter (DM) minihalos, are compelling progenitors. This study presents a suite of stellar evolution models for accreting Pop III.1 protostars, calculated with the \textsc{GENEC} code. We systematically explore a wide parameter space, spanning ambient WIMP densities of $\rho_\chi \sim 10^{12}\mbox{-}10^{16}\,\mathrm{GeV\,cm^{-3}}$ and gas accretion rates of $10^{-3}\mbox{-}10^{-1}\,M_\odot\,\mathrm{yr^{-1}}$, to quantify the effects of DM annihilation. A central finding is that for a protostar to grow to supermassive scales ($\gtrsim 10^5 \, M_{\odot}$), the ambient DM density in the immediate vicinity of the star must exceed a critical threshold of $\rho_{\chi} \gtrsim 5 \times 10^{14} \, \text{GeV cm}^{-3}$. The energy injected by WIMP annihilation inflates the protostar, lowering its surface temperature, which suppresses the ionizing feedback that would otherwise halt accretion and significantly delays the onset of hydrogen fusion. This heating also governs the star's final fate: in dense halos ($\rho_\chi \gtrsim 10^{15}\,\mathrm{GeV\,cm^{-3}}$), stars remain stable against general relativistic instability beyond $10^6 \, M_{\odot}$, whereas at lower densities ($\rho_\chi \lesssim 10^{13}\,\mathrm{GeV\,cm^{-3}}$), they collapse at masses of $\sim 5 \times 10^5 \, M_{\odot}$. Once the DM fuel is exhausted and core burning commences, the protostar contracts and its ionising photon output can reach very high levels $\sim 10^{53} s^{-1}$. These distinct evolutionary phases offer clear observational signatures for the JWST, providing a robust, physically-grounded pathway for forming heavy black hole seeds in the early universe.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we perform reconstruction of \( f(Q) \) gravity inspired by the New Agegraphic Dark Energy (NADE) model, aiming to account for the Universe's late time acceleration without invoking a cosmological constant. Utilizing a power law scale factor \( a(t) = a_0 t^h \), we derive an analytic form for \( f(Q) \) based on a correspondence with NADE, where the conformal time serves as the infrared cutoff. The resulting model naturally recovers General Relativity in the limit and exhibits a geometrically motivated dark energy component. We constrain the model parameters using recent Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) data from DESI DR2 BAO and previous BAO observations through the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis. The reconstructed Hubble parameter \( H(z) \) demonstrates excellent agreement with observational data, achieving high \( R^2 \) values and low \(\chi^2_{\min}\), AIC, and BIC scores, outperforming the standard \( \Lambda \)CDM model. Further, we investigate the cosmological evolution using the deceleration parameter \( q(z) \), effective equation of state \( \omega_{\mathrm{eff}}(z) \), and Om diagnostics. The model exhibits a clear transition from deceleration to acceleration with a present value \( q(0) \in \left[-0.5879, -0.3333\right] \) and transition redshift $z_{\mathrm{tr}} \sim 0.5209-0.8126$, while maintaining \( -1 < \omega_{\mathrm{eff}}(z) < -1/3 \), indicating quintessence like behavior. Om diagnostics consistently show a negative slope, further confirming deviation from \( \Lambda \)CDM. Energy condition analysis reveals that WEC, DEC, and NEC are satisfied, while SEC is violated only at low redshifts which is consistent with cosmic acceleration. Overall, the reconstructed \( f(Q) \) model provides a viable, observationally consistent, and theoretically motivated alternative to standard dark energy scenarios.

 Rocky exoplanet characterization has been a top priority for early James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) science operations. Several milestones have been achieved, including the most precise rocky planet transmission spectra measured to date, and the first detection of thermal emission for rocky worlds below 800 Kelvin. Despite these advances, no atmospheres have been definitively detected. Several transmission spectra show tentative evidence for molecular absorption features, but these hints are marginally significant and the spectra may be affected by stellar contamination. Features from many plausible atmospheres, including those dominated by oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon dioxide, are below the current noise level. Meanwhile, the emerging picture from thermal emission spectra is that the planets have hot daysides, consistent with either a bare rock composition or low surface pressure atmospheres (< 10 bar). Higher surface pressures and high carbon dioxide abundances are generally ruled out, assuming cloud-free atmosphere models. The absence of strong CO$_2$ features hints at a limited initial volatile inventory or rapid atmospheric escape during the planets' early lifetimes. Taken together, these results motivate a push towards higher precision data, as well as observations of cooler planets that may be more likely to retain atmospheres. As a goal for future transmission spectroscopy, we suggest a "five scale height challenge," to achieve the precision necessary to detect CO$_2$ features in nitrogen-rich atmospheres. Detecting rocky planet atmospheres remains challenging, but with JWST's excellent performance and a continuing investment of telescope time, we are optimistic these uncharted atmospheres will be detected in coming years.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the consequences of non-ideal mixing between silicate, iron metal, and hydrogen for the structures of the cores of sub-Neptunes with implications for super-Earths, warm Neptunes, and ice giants. A method of extrapolating what we know about the miscibility in the three bounding binary systems MgSiO$_3$-H$_2$, MgSiO$_3$-Fe, and Fe-H$_2$ to the ternary composition space is used to deduce the phase equilibria of this system at relevant temperature and pressure conditions. We find that while separate silicate and metal phases can exist at shallow depths, the phases become entirely miscible deeper in the cores, thus altering the density structure of the cores. The assumption that the interiors of large rocky planets, either with extant magma oceans beneath H$_2$-rich envelopes, or evolved from such bodies, are composed of a differentiated metal core overlain by a silicate mantle is inconsistent with our understanding of the phase equilibria of these bodies.

 - **Abstract**
 We present A databaSe of millimeTeR ObservatioNs of Asteroids Using acT (ASTRONAUT) hosted on Amazon Web Services, Inc. (AWS) in the form of a public Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) bucket. This bucket is an Amazon cloud storage database containing flux measurements for a group of asteroids at millimeter (mm) wavelengths. These measurements were collected by the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) from 2017 to 2021 in frequency bands centered near 90, 150, and 220 GHz. The ASTRONAUT database contains observation times, normalized flux values, and associated error bars for 170 asteroids above a signal-to-noise ratio of 5 for a single frequency band over the stacked co-added maps. We provide an example in generating light curves with this database. We also present a Jupyter notebook to serve as a reference guide when using the S3 bucket. The container and notebook are publicly available in a GitHub repository.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a general-relativistic study of the distribution of proton superconductivity in strongly magnetized neutron stars (NSs), employing the $XNS$ code to solve the coupled Einstein-Maxwell equations. This work extends the previous investigation by us in a few key directions: (i) we explore equilibrium configurations with both toroidal and poloidal magnetic field geometries, (ii) we account for complex many-body effects incorporating microscopically derived pairing gaps, and (iii) our models utilize equation(s) of state (EoS) derived from microscopic many-body theory, including realistic two- and three-body nuclear forces, as well as from relativistic mean-field models. We compare superconducting topologies across our collection of EoS and explore the influences of magnetic field geometry in stellar models parameterized by central density. Our models confirm the absence of $S$-wave superconductivity in the inner core and, importantly, reveal that non-superconducting regions exhibit complex three-dimensional geometries: doughnut-shaped for toroidal fields and prolate-shaped for poloidal fields -- spatial structures that are inherently absent from one-dimensional analyses. We also compute magnetic deformations and ellipticities for several millisecond pulsars (MSPs), estimating their continuous gravitational wave (CGW) strain. While these MSPs remain undetectable by current detectors, next-generation instruments such as the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer may detect their signals, opening an observational window into internal superconductivity and internal magnetic field of NSs, as well as, the fundamental microphysics of dense matter.

 - **Abstract**
 Elements heavier than hydrogen and helium, collectively termed metals, were created inside stars and dispersed through space at the final stages of stellar evolution. The relative amounts of different isotopes (variants of the same element with different masses) in stellar atmospheres provide clues about how our galaxy evolved chemically over billions of years. M dwarfs are small, cool, long-lived stars that comprise three-quarters of all stars in our galaxy. Their spectra exhibit rich fingerprints of their composition, making them potential tracers of chemical evolution. We measure rare carbon and oxygen isotopes in 32 nearby M dwarfs spanning a range of metallicities using high-resolution infrared spectroscopy. We find that stars with higher metal content have lower 12C/13C ratios, indicating they formed from material progressively enriched in 13C over time. This pattern is consistent with models where novae eruptions contributed significant amounts of 13C to the interstellar medium over the past few billion years. Our measurements of 16O/18O ratio match theoretical predictions and suggest that metal-rich stars reach 16O/18O ratios significantly lower than the Sun. These results establish M dwarfs as tracers of chemical enrichment throughout cosmic history.

 - **Abstract**
 Core-collapse supernovae provide a unique opportunity to probe axions because they can be a copious source of the particles. It has recently been proposed that axion helioscopes can be used for the direct search for supernova axions if a supernova event appears within a few hundred parsecs. However, the event number of supernova axions has been estimated only within the post-process framework. In this study, we perform long-term supernova simulations for a 9.6M_sun star coupled with the axion emission to reevaluate the event number of axions detected by the helioscopes. We find that the additional cooling induced by the axion emission can significantly decrease the temperature in the proto-neutron star. As a result, the axion luminosity and hence the axion event number are reduced, compared with the result obtained through post-processing. Our result indicates that the nonlinear feedback of the axion emission is an essential factor to predict the axion detectability, and underscores the need for systematic simulation studies across various progenitor models.

 - **Abstract**
 The magnetic field is integral to our understanding of the formation and dynamical evolution of molecular clouds and star formation within. We present a polarimetric survey of 17 massive protostellar cluster forming clumps, covered in 34 pointings in the 230-GHz window using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). The two array configurations, C43-1 and C43-4, probe linearly polarized dust emission, hence the plane-of-the-sky orientation of magnetic fields, at resolutions of 1\arcsec\ and 0\arcsec.4 that correspond to approximately 0.01pc core and $10^3$ au envelope scales, respectively. The relative orientations (ROs) of the magnetic field probed at two spatial scales are analyzed for the entire protostellar cluster sample and for a subset of objects in NGC 6334. We found a bimodal distribution of ROs with peaks at 0° (parallel) and 90°(orthogonal) for the entire sample combined as well as for NGC 6334. We investigate the physical origin of this bimodal distribution through a projected Rayleigh statistic (PRS) analysis in relation to column densities and local gravity in NGC 6334. We found an excess of parallel magnetic fields at column densities $> 10^{23}$ \cmm. The underlying cause of the RO distribution of the magnetic field is gravitational collapse at higher gas densities, which drags and reorients the magnetic field as shown in the alignment between the magnetic field and the direction of gravitational forces. The distribution of ROs observed here is consistent with the evolution of relative orientations of an initially sub-Alvénic cloud that becomes magnetically super-critical and super-Alvénic as the cloud collapses to form stars.

 - **Abstract**
 (Abridged) Quasar studies with Herschel/SPIRE often report host luminosities ranging from 10^{12} to 10^{14} Lsun, suggestive of star formation rates (SFRs) of up to several thousand Msun/yr. Due to the limited spatial resolution of SPIRE, it is uncertain whether the far-infrared (FIR) emission originates from the quasar itself, nearby sources, or unrelated sources within the SPIRE beam. High-resolution observations at wavelengths close to the SPIRE coverage are needed to pinpoint the true source of the FIR emission. In this work we unambiguously identify the ALMA Band 7 counterparts of a statistical sample of 152 FIR-bright SDSS quasars and estimate the multiplicity rates among these systems. Based on the multiplicities, we assess the importance of mergers as triggers for concomitant accretion onto supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and extreme star formation. In ~60% of cases, the submm emission originates from a single counterpart within the SPIRE beam, centred on the optical coordinates of the quasar. The multiplicity rate increases by a factor of ~2.5 between redshifts 1 and 2.5. The incidence of multiplicities is consistent among broad absorption line (BAL) quasars and non-BAL quasars. The multiplicities observed in a fraction of the sample indicate that, while mergers enhance gas inflow efficiency, there must be viable alternatives for driving synchronous SMBH growth and intense star formation in isolated systems. We report the serendipitous detection of two CO(6-5) and three CO(7-6) transitions out of the eight such transitions expected based on the spectral setup and the redshifts of the objects in the sample. Higher transitions are not detected, indicating that the quasars are not exciting sufficiently the gas in their hosts. Finally, we also detect a potential emission of H2O, HCN (10-9) or a combination of both in the spectrum of a quasar at redshift 1.67.

 - **Abstract**
 Context: Cosmic rays drive several key processes for the chemistry and dynamical evolution of star-forming regions. Their effect is quantified mainly by means of the cosmic-ray ionisation rate $\zeta_2$. Aims: We aim to obtain a sample of $\zeta_2$ measurements in 20 low-mass starless cores embedded in different parental clouds, to assess the average level of ionisation in this kind of sources and to investigate the role of the environment in this context. The warmest clouds in our sample are Ophiuchus and Corona Australis, where star formation activity is higher than in the Taurus cloud and the other isolated cores we targeted. Methods: We compute $\zeta_2$ using an analytical method based on the {column density} of ortho-$\rm H_2D^+$, the CO abundance, and the deuteration level of HCO$^+$. To estimate these quantities, we analysed new, high-sensitivity molecular line observations obtained with the Atacama Pathfinder EXperiment (APEX) single-dish telescope and archival continuum data from Herschel. Results: We report $\zeta_2$ estimates in 17 cores in our sample and provide upper limits on the three remaining sources. The values span almost two orders of magnitude, from $1.3 \times 10^{-18}\, \rm s^{-1}$ to $8.5 \times 10^{-17}\, \rm s^{-1}$. Conclusions: We find no significant correlation between $\zeta_2$ and the core's column densities $N\rm (H_2)$. On the contrary, we find a positive correlation between $\zeta_2$ and the cores' temperature, estimated via Herschel data: cores embedded in warmer environments present higher ionisation levels. The warmest clouds in our sample are Ophiuchus and Corona Australis, where star formation activity is higher than in the other clouds we targeted. The higher ionisation rates in these regions support the scenario that low-mass protostars in the vicinity of our targeted cores contribute to the re-acceleration of local cosmic rays.
#### VLT/CRIRES+ observations of warm Neptune WASP-107 b: Molecular detections and challenges in ground-based transmission spectroscopy of cooler and cloudy exoplanets

 - **Abstract**
 Atmospheres of transiting exoplanets can be studied spectroscopically using space-based or ground-based observations. Each has its own strengths and weaknesses, so there are benefits to both approaches. This is especially true for challenging targets such as cooler, smaller exoplanets whose atmospheres likely contain many molecular species and cloud decks. We aim to study the atmosphere of the warm Neptune-like exoplanet WASP-107 b (Teq~740 K). Several molecular species have been detected in this exoplanet in recent space-based JWST studies, and we aim to confirm and expand upon these detections using ground-based VLT, evaluating how well our findings agree with previously retrieved atmospheric parameters. We observe two transits of WASP-107 b with VLT/CRIRES+ and create cross-correlation templates of the target atmosphere based on retrieval results from JWST studies. We create different templates to investigate the impact of varying volume mixing ratios of species and inclusion or exclusion of clouds. Considering this target's observational challenges, we create simulated observations prior to evaluating real data to assess expected detection significances. We report detections of two molecular species, CO (~6 S/N) and H2O (~4.5 S/N). This confirms previous space-based detections and demonstrates, for the first time, the capability of VLT/CRIRES+ to detect species in targets cooler than hot Jupiters using transmission spectroscopy. We show our analysis is sensitive to cloud inclusion, but less so to different volume mixing ratios. Interestingly, our detection deviates from its expected location in our Kp-vsys diagrams, and we speculate on possible reasons for this. We demonstrate that the error budget for relatively cooler exoplanets is severely reduced in comparison to hotter exoplanets, and underline need for further work in context of high-resolution spectroscopy.

 - **Abstract**
 Excellent (<25 mas) H$_{\alpha}$ images of the star TYC 5709-354-1 led to the discovery of a rare H$_{\alpha}$ protoplanet. This star was discovered by the WISPIT survey to have a large multi-ring transitional disk, and is hereafter WISPIT 2. Our H$_{\alpha}$ images of 2025, April 13 and April 16 discovered an accreting (H$_{\alpha}$ in emission) protoplanet: WISPIT 2b (r=309.43$\pm$1.56 mas; (~54 au deprojected), PA=242.21$\pm$0.41 degrees) likely clearing a dust-free gap between the two brightest dust rings in the transitional disk. Our SNR=12.5 detection gave an H$_{\alpha}$ ASDI contrast of (6.5$\pm$0.5)x10$^{-4}$ and a H$_{\alpha}$ line flux of (1.29$\pm$0.28)x10$^{-15}$ erg/s/cm$^2$. We also present L' photometry from LBT/LMIRcam of the planet (L'=15.30$\pm$0.05 mag) which, when coupled with an age of 5.1$^{+2.4}_{-1.3}$ Myr, yields a planet mass estimate of 5.3$\pm$1.0 Mjup from the DUSTY evolutionary models. WISPIT 2b is accreting at 2.25$^{-0.17}_{+3.75}$x10$^{-12}$ Msun/yr. WISPIT 2b is very similar to the other H$_{\alpha}$ protoplanets in terms of mass, age, flux, and accretion rate. The inclination of the system (${\it i}$=44 degrees) is also, surprisingly, very similar to the other known H$\alpha$ protoplanet systems which all cluster from 37$\leq{\it i}\leq$52 degrees. We argue this clustering has only a ~1.0% (2.6 sigma) probability of occurring randomly, and so we speculate that magnetospherical accretion might have a preferred inclination range (~37-52 degrees) for the direct (cloud free, low extinction) line of sight to the H-alpha line formation/shock region. We also find at 110mas (~15au deprojected) a close companion candidate (CC1) which may be consistent with an inner dusty 9$\pm$4 Mjup planet.

 - **Abstract**
 Type IIn supernovae (SNe IIn) are a subclass of core-collapse SNe in which strong interactions occur between the ejecta and dense circumstellar material, creating ideal conditions for the production of high-energy neutrinos. This makes them promising candidate sources of neutrinos. In this work, we conduct an association study between 163 SNe IIn observed by the Zwicky Transient Facility and 138 neutrino alert events detected by the IceCube neutrino observatory. After excluding alerts with poor localization, we find two SNe that are spatiotemporally coincident with neutrino events. IC231027A and IC250421A coincide with the positions of SN2023syz and SN2025cbj, respectively, within their localization uncertainties, and the neutrino arrival times are delayed by 38 days and 61 days relative to the discovery times of the corresponding SNe. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we estimate that the probability of such two coincidences occurring by chance in our sample is $p \sim 0.67\%$, suggesting a high likelihood that they arise from genuine associations, though the result is not yet statistical significant. Furthermore, model calculations show that the expected numbers of neutrino events from these SNe IIn could be consistent with the actual observations. Our study provides possible evidence that interacting SNe may be potential neutrino-emitting sources.

 - **Abstract**
 The dSphs around the Milky Way are commonly considered as systems that are supported by velocity dispersion against self-gravitation. They have been long accounted among the best targets to search for indirect DM signatures in the GeV-to-TeV gamma-rays due to absence of astrophysical gamma-ray foreground or background emission. We present forecasts on the sensitivity of the future CTAO for the search for annihilating or decaying DM in such targets. We perform an original selection of candidates out of the current catalog of known objects, including both classical and ultra-faint targets. For each of them, we calculate the expected amount of DM using the most updated and complete available samples of photometric and spectroscopic data of member stars, adopting a common framework of data treatment for both classes of objects. In this way, we are able to generate novel astrophysical factor profiles for general indirect DM searches that we compare with the current literature. Out of a starting sample of 64 dSphs, we highlight the 8 most promising targets - DraI, CBe, UMaII, UMi and Wil1 in the Northern hemisphere; RetII, Scl and SgrII in the Southern hemisphere - for which different DM density models (either cored or cuspy) lead to similar expectations, at variance with what happens for other DM targets - thus resulting in more robust predictions. We find that CTAO will provide the strongest limits above ~10 TeV, down to values of velocity-averaged annihilation cross section of ~5$ \times 10^{-25}$ cm$^3$ s$^{-1}$ and up to decay lifetimes of ~10$^{26}$ s for combined limits on the best targets. We argue that the largest source of inaccuracy is due to the still imprecise determination of the DM content, especially for ultra-faint dSphs. We propose possible strategies of observation for CTAO, either optimized on a deep focus on the best known candidates, or on the diversification of targets.
#### A new multifluid method for dusty astrophysical flows. Application to turbulent protostellar collapses

 - **Abstract**
 Stars and planets form in collapsing clouds of gas and dust. The presence of dust grains and their local distribution play a significant role throughout the protostellar sequence, from the thermodynamics and the chemistry of molecular clouds to the opacity of collapsing protostellar cores and the coupling between the gas and the magnetic field and down to planet formation in young and evolved disks. We aim to simulate the dynamics of the dust, considering the whole range of grain sizes, from few nanometers to millimeters. We implemented a neutral pressureless multifluid that samples the dust size distribution in the RAMSES code. This multifluid is dynamically coupled to the gas via a drag source term and self-gravity, relying on the Eulerian approach. We designed a Riemann solver for the gas and dust mixture that prevents unphysical dust-to-gas ratio variations for well-coupled grains. We illustrated the capacities of the code by performing simulations of a protostellar collapse down to the formation of a first hydrostatic core, both for small and large dust grains. Grains over 100 microns significantly decouple from the gas. The spatial maps and the probability density functions indicate that dust enrichment within the first hydrostatic core and in some locations of the envelope increases as a function of the grain size and the level of initial turbulence. Thanks to the novel Riemann solver, we recovered the terminal velocity regime, even at low resolution. Moreover, we successfully extended it to regimes where the grain inertia matters. The multifluid module performs the coupling between the dust and the gas self-consistently all through the dynamical scales. The dust enrichment in the first hydrostatic core and the envelope have been revised here, assuming the initial turbulence and grain sizes. This enables us to probe new potential conditions for planet formation.
#### Silane-Methane Competition in Sub-Neptune Atmospheres as a Diagnostic of Metallicity and Magma Oceans

 - **Abstract**
 The James Webb Space Telescope is characterising the atmospheres of sub-Neptunes. The presence of magma oceans on sub-Neptunes is expected to strongly alter the chemistry of their envelopes (100 bar-100 kbar) and atmospheres (1 mbar-100 bar). At the magma ocean-envelope boundary (MEB, >10 kbar), gas properties deviate from ideality, yet the effects of real gas behaviour on chemical equilibria remain underexplored. Here, we compute equilibrium between magma-gas and gas-gas reactions using real gas equations of state in the H-He-C-N-O-Si system for TOI-421b, a canonical hot sub-Neptune potentially hosting a magma ocean. We find that H and N are the most soluble in magma, followed by He and C. We fit real gas equations of state to experimental data on SiH$_4$, and show that, for a fully molten mantle, SiH$_4$ dominates at the MEB under accreted gas metallicity of 1$\times$ solar, but is supplanted by CH$_4$ at 100$\times$ solar. Lower mantle melt fractions lower both magma-derived Si abundances in the envelope and the solubility of H and He in magma, yielding H$_2$- and He-rich envelopes. Projecting equilibrium chemistry through the atmosphere (1 mbar-100 bar), we find that condensation of $\beta$-quartz 'clouds' depletes Si-bearing gases, although SiH$_4$ remains abundant at solar metallicity. SiH$_4$/CH$_4$ ratios increase with mantle melt fraction and decrease with metallicity. These effects also deplete H$_2$ via CH$_4$ and SiH$_4$ formation and the dissolution of H$_2$ into magma. The competition between SiH$_4$ and CH$_4$ presents a diagnostic of metallicity and magma oceans. The corollary is that H$_2$- and He-rich, SiH$_4$- and CH$_4$-poor (<5%) atmospheres may indicate a limited role or absence of magma oceans on sub-Neptunes.

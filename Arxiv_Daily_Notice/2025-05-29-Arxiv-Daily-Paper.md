 - **Abstract**
 The young $\beta$ Pictoris system has been monitored with high-resolution optical spectrographs for decades. These observations have revealed strongly variable absorption in the Ca II H\&K lines attributed to in-falling cometary bodies. Since 2003, over 9000 HARPS observations of $\beta$ Pictoris have been taken and many of these have not yet been used for exocomet studies. We search these spectra for new exocomet phenomenology enabled by the long time coverage and large volume of this dataset. We systematically carry out telluric correction of the HARPS spectra using molecfit, compare multi-year observations of the Ca II and Na I lines and use a Bayesian fitting algorithm to extract exocomet line parameters. We explore the usage of an unbiased reference spectrum with which to calibrate the continuum, and investigate Keplerian orbital solutions to observed exocomet acceleration. We find a general absence of exocometary sodium line absorption, with only two instances of clear ($\sim 2$ % deep) exocometary sodium out of 198 nights of observation, as well as a weaker ($\sim 1$ %) feature that persists over 13 nights in 2004. We find that these events occur during times of deep Ca II absorption at the same red-shift, implying that strongly Ca II-evaporating exocomets also exhibit detectable levels of Na I, in spite of the vast majority of Na I being rapidly photo-ionised in close proximity to the star. We find long-lived Ca II absorption in 2017 and 2018 that persists on a timescale of a year, which may be difficult to explain with the classical exocomet model. Finally, we investigate two strongly accelerating, blue-shifted exocomes observed in 2019 that show strong and sudden departures from Keplerian motion, suggesting rapid changes to the dynamics of the exocomet cloud. We hypothesize that this is caused by the destruction of the comet nuclei shortly after their periastron passages.
#### The Initial Mass Function of Stars and Brown Dwarfs in the Upper Sco Association

 - **Abstract**
 I present infrared spectroscopy of 37 brown dwarf candidates in the Upper Sco association, 35 of which are classified as young and cool, making them likely members. This sample includes many of the faintest spectroscopically confirmed members ($K=16$-17 mag), which should have masses down to $\sim0.007$-0.01 $M_\odot$ for the range of ages in Upper Sco (7-14 Myr). Using my updated membership catalog for Upper Sco, I have estimated the initial mass function (IMF) for a field in the center of the association that encompasses $\sim80$\% of the known members. I have derived IMFs in the same manner for previous membership samples in three other star-forming populations, consisting of IC 348, Taurus, and Chameleon I. When using logarithmic mass bins, the substellar IMFs for Upper Sco and the other young regions are roughly flat down to the completeness limits of $\sim$0.01 $M_\odot$. These IMFs are broadly similar to mass functions recently measured for the solar neighborhood. Finally, I have used W1$-$W2 colors to search for excess emission from circumstellar disks among the late-type objects in my new census of Upper Sco. I measure an excess fraction of 52/200 for members with spectral types of M6.25-M9.5, which is similar to results from previous membership catalogs. For the L-type members, it is difficult to detect the small W2 excess emission produced by typical disks around brown dwarfs because of the large uncertainties in spectral types, which preclude accurate estimates of the photospheric colors. Thus, W2 photometry provides poor constraints on the presence of disks for the L-type members of Upper Sco.

 - **Abstract**
 Aims. This study investigates the magnetic evolution of solar active regions (ARs), with a particular focus on understanding how the magnetic morphology of simple and complex ARs changes throughout their lifetime. Methods. To analyse the magnetic evolution of ARs, we developed a Magnetic Evolution Method (MEM) that segments each region's lifetime into three phases: growth, main, and recovery. The method was applied to ARs observed between January 1996 and December 2020. Results. We found that complex active regions (CARs) have a mean lifetime of approximately 24 days, which is 8 days longer than that of simple active regions (SARs). Most CARs (94%) first appear with a simple magnetic structure and remain in this configuration for about 3 days (growth phase), before transitioning into complex structures for around 5 days (main phase), after which they typically revert to a simple state (recovery phase). The average lifetimes of SARs and CARs show no significant difference between solar cycles 23 and 24, suggesting that active region lifetimes are independent of the solar cycle. Conclusions. By tracking the full magnetic evolution of ARs, our study reveals that CARs typically become magnetically complex around three days after emergence and remain in that state for a limited but critical period. This temporal structure, uncovered using a novel method that follows ARs throughout their full development, provides important context for identifying the magnetic conditions associated with increased eruptive potential. The results offer a foundation for improving the forecasting of solar flares and magnetic clouds, and suggest that the magnetic evolution of ARs is largely independent of the solar cycle.

 - **Abstract**
 We extend the analytic expressions for polytropic wind-driven bubbles and their shock structures, formulated initially in Koo and McKee 1992(a,b), focusing on spherically symmetric configurations in astrophysical environments with $\rho\propto r^{-2}$, which arises naturally in the star-forming environment and has applications to winds flowing into a preexisting bubble. Wind luminosity is assumed to be constant, and as a result the shock velocities of these bubbles are constant in time. The ratio of specific heats is assumed to be the same in the shocked ambient medium and the shocked wind. Numerical results are presented for one selected ratio of wind density to ambient density. Exact ODEs are written for the compressed wind region and approximate solutions are found by fitting the ODE solutions. By analyzing the interactions between stellar winds and ambient media in the strong compression limit, we model the formation and evolution of spherical bubbles, highlighting their shock fronts and contact discontinuities. Our analytic method provides an intuitive approach to calculating the thickness of bubble shells, which is crucial for understanding their dynamics and observational characteristics. A numerical method explores conditions without explicitly requiring the strong compression limit, and then we compare numerical to analytical results under various conditions.

 - **Abstract**
 Since the emission of water molecules cannot be observed from Earth, less abundant isotopologues, such as H$_2^{18}$O and HDO, are used to trace water in star-forming regions. The main aim of this study is to determine HDO abundance in the hot core RCW 120 S2. We performed observations of the hot core in the 200-255~GHz range using the nFLASH230 receiver on the APEX telescope. Two HDO lines were detected toward RCW 120 S2. Their intensities are described by excitation temperature $286\pm2$~K and gas number density $\geq 10^9$~cm$^{-3}$. The emission originates from the hot core rather than the warm dense envelope surrounding a central young stellar object. The HDO column density ranges from $(3.9-7.9)\times10^{13}$~cm$^{-3}$ with a most probable value $5.6\times10^{13}$~cm$^{-3}$. The HDO abundance relative to hydrogen nuclei is $1.5\times10^{-9}$. This HDO abundance value is among the lowest reported for hot cores. Combined with the non-detection of the H$_2^{18}$O line, we conclude that protostellar heating in RCW 120 S2 is still in its early stages.

 - **Abstract**
 Mass drainage is frequently observed in solar filaments. During filament eruptions, falling material most likely flows along magnetic field lines, which may provide important clues for the magnetic structures of filaments. Here we study three filament eruptions exhibiting significant mass draining, often manifested as falling threads at a constant speed ranging between 30--300 km/s. We found that most of the falling material lands onto the hooked segments of flare ribbons, only a small fraction lands inside the hooks, and almost none lands onto the straight segments of ribbons. Based on these observations we surmise that before eruptions most of the filament mass is entrained by field lines threading the quasi-separatrix layers (QSLs), which wrap around the filament field and whose footpoints are mapped by the hooked ribbons, and that the magnetic reconnection involving these field lines is the major cause of the mass drainage during eruptions. Additionally, the light curves of the hooked ribbons suggest that during eruptions the earlier (later) QSL boundary of filaments is threaded by mass-loaded (depleted) field lines. By assuming that the constant-speed motion is due to a drag force balancing the gravity, we proposed a simplified analytical model to estimate the density contrast of the falling material. The estimated density contrast is then fed into a numerical model, in which filament threads fall along vertical magnetic field lines through a gravitationally stratified atmosphere. The resultant falling speeds, however, are short of observed values, which calls for further investigations.
#### The chemical yields of stars in the range 9-15 Msun

 - **Abstract**
 In Limongi et al. (2024) we presented and discussed the main evolutionary properties and final fate of stars in the mass range 7-15 Msun. The evolutions of those models were computed by means of a medium size nuclear network that guaranteed a proper calculation of the nuclear energy generation and hence a good modeling of the physical evolution of these stars. In the present paper, we extend this study by computing the detailed chemical yields of stars in the mass range 9-15 Msun, i.e., those stars that explode as core collapse supernovae (CCSNe). The explosive nucleosynthesis is then computed in the framework of the thermal bomb induced explosion by means of the HYPERION code (Limongi and Chieffi 2020). We find that: (1) the yields of the intermediate mass elements (i.e., O to P) show a steep decrease as the inital mass decreases; (2) the yields of s-weak component, i.e., those produced by the slow neutron captures from Ga to to the first neutron closure shell, decrease almost linearly as a function of the initial mass with respect to the ones produced by the more massive stars; (3) the global contribution of the stars in the mass range 9.22-13 Msun to the yields of a generation of massive stars averaged over a standard initial mass function is negligible for essentially all the isotopes. In spite of this, however, the models of stars in this mass range can be fundamental to interpret the observations of specific supernovae.

 - **Abstract**
 Sulfur is essential for life, but its abundance and distribution in the interstellar medium remain uncertain, with over 90% of sulfur undetected in cold molecular clouds. Sulfur allotropes (S$_{\rm n}$) have been proposed as possible reservoirs, but the only detected interstellar molecule with a disulfide bond is S$_2$H in the Horsehead Nebula, making the estimation of sulfur chains abundances difficult. Here we present total-power ALMA images of H$_2$S, S$_2$H, SO$_2$, CO$^+$, and SH$^+$ towards the Horsehead nebula. These observations, with unprecedented sensitivity (rms $\sim$ 1.5 mK), provide the first detections of SH$^+$ and CO$^+$ in this region, together with the identification of a new S$_2$H line. The comparison of the spectroscopic images of H$_2$S, S$_2$H, SO$_2$, CO$^+$ and SH$^+$ shows that the S$_2$H emission originates from a warm gas layer adjacent to the photodissociation front. The emission peak of S$_2$H is offset from those of reactive ions such as SH$^+$, CO$^+$, and SO$^+$, suggesting that gas-phase reactions involving SH$^+$ and H$_2$S are not the dominant formation pathway of S$_2$H. Instead, we propose that S$_2$H is desorbed from irradiated grain surfaces by non-thermal processes. The SH$^+$ detection indicates that sulfur is not significantly depleted at the UV-irradiated edge of the molecular cloud, arguing against a major refractory sulfur reservoir in the interior of molecular clouds.

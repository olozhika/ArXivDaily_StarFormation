#### GenASiS: General Astrophysical Simulation System. II. Self-gravitating Baryonic Matter

 - **Abstract**
 GenASiS (General Astrophysical Simulation System) is a code being developed initially and primarily, though not exclusively, for the simulation of core-collapse supernovae on the world's leading capability supercomputers. This paper -- the second in a series -- documents capabilities for Newtonian self-gravitating fluid dynamics, including tabulated microphysical equations of state treating nuclei and nuclear matter (`baryonic matter'). Computation of the gravitational potential of a spheroid, and simulation of the gravitational collapse of dust and of an ideal fluid, provide tests of self-gravitation against known solutions. In multidimensional computations of the adiabatic collapse, bounce, and explosion of spherically symmetric pre-supernova progenitors -- which we propose become a standard benchmark for code comparisons -- we find that the explosions are prompt and remain spherically symmetric (as expected), with an average shock expansion speed and total kinetic energy that are inversely correlated with the progenitor mass at the onset of collapse and the compactness parameter.

 - **Abstract**
 The fundamental question of baryogenesis and the problem of matter-antimatter asymmetry motivate this study into the formation and evolution of antimatter objects in the early Universe. Hypothesize is the existence of isolated antimatter domains in a baryon-asymmetric Universe that survive until the era of first star formation ($Z \approx 20$). By assuming CPT-symmetry, the thermodynamics, mechanics, and energy dynamics of an antimatter gas cloud (composed of antihydrogen and antihelium) are treated symmetrically to their primordial matter counterparts. Analysis demonstrates the physical feasibility of the gravitational collapse process for a conservatively estimated antimatter domain ($\approx 5 \times 10^3 M_{\odot}$). The initial conditions easily satisfy the Jeans and Bonnor-Ebert mass criteria, indicating a high propensity for instability and runaway collapse. The subsequent dynamical evolution, driven by $\bar{H}_2$ cooling, is predicted to proceed identically to that of Population III star formation, leading to the formation of a dense, adiabatic anti-protostellar core. The theoretical viability of a true antistar hinges upon a critical assumption: the physical possibility of antinuclear fusion (e.g., the antiproton cycle) under extreme core conditions. Assuming this symmetry holds, the collapse is predicted to yield massive antistars ($\gtrsim 22 M_{\odot}$). This suggests that if antimatter domains formed in the early Universe, they likely underwent stellar formation. Observational constraints on the existence of these objects must rely on the detection of characteristic high-energy $\gamma$-ray or X-ray signals resulting from matter-antimatter annihilation at the domain boundaries or during mass accretion.

 - **Abstract**
 With recent advances in the modeling of the solar system giant planets, rapid progress has been made in understanding the remaining questions pertaining to their formation and evolution. However, this progress has largely neglected the significant constraints on the interior of Saturn's structure imposed by the observed oscillation frequencies in its rings. Here, we study initial conditions for Saturn's evolution that, after $4.56\;\mathrm{Gyr}$ of evolution, give rise to planetary structures admitting oscillation frequencies consistent with those observed via Saturn's ring seismology. Restricting our attention to models without compact rocky cores, we achieve simultaneous good agreement with most observed properties of Saturn at the level of current evolutionary models and with key frequencies in the observed oscillation spectrum. Our preliminary work suggests that Saturn's interior stably stratified region may be moderately less extended ($\sim 0.4$--$0.5R_{\rm Sat}$) than previously thought, which is important for reconciling the seismic constraints with evolutionary models. We also tentatively find that the deep helium gradients inferred by previous, static structural modelling of Saturn's ring seismology may not be required to reproduce the observed seismology data.

 - **Abstract**
 Core-collapse supernovae (SNe) are sources of gravitational waves (GWs) produced by hydrodynamical instabilities and highly time-dependent anisotropies of the neutrino radiation. In this work we analyze both contributions to the GW signal for two state-of-the-art three-dimensional (3D) SN models computed with the Prometheus-Vertex neutrino-hydrodynamics code. In contrast to the far majority of models analyzed for GWs so far, our core-collapse simulations were started with 12.28 M_sun (18.88 M_sun) progenitors, whose final hour (7 min) of convective oxygen-shell burning was computed in 3D and featured a vigorous oxygen-neon shell merger. The corresponding large-scale asymmetries in the oxygen layer are conducive to buoyancy-aided neutrino-driven explosions. The models were continuously evolved in 3D from the pre-collapse evolution until 5.11 s (1.68 s) after the core bounce. The GW signals result from the well-known dynamical phenomena in the SN core such as prompt postshock convection, neutrino-driven convection, the standing accretion shock instability, proto-neutron star oscillations, and anisotropic ejecta expansion. They do not exhibit any new or specific features that can be unambiguously connected to the powerful pre-collapse activity in the progenitors, but we identify interesting differences compared to results in the literature. We also discuss measurement prospects by interferometers, confirming that GW signals from future Galactic SNe will be detectable with existing and next-generation experiments working in the frequency range f ~ 1-2000 Hz.

 - **Abstract**
 In this study, we present a comprehensive analysis of the structural, astrophysical, and dynamical properties of eight open clusters: NGC 559, NGC 1817, NGC 2141, NGC 7245, Ruprecht 15, Ruprecht 137, Ruprecht 142, and Ruprecht 169, using precise astrometric and photometric data from Gaia Data Release 3. By fitting the King model to the radial density profiles, we determined the structural parameters of the clusters, including core and limiting radii, which were found to range from 3.07 to 16.21 arcmin and from 9.97 to 25.97 arcmin, respectively. Fundamental astrophysical parameters were derived by fitting PARSEC isochrones to the colour-magnitude diagrams. The results show that the clusters have logarithmic ages between 7.95 and 9.34, metallicities in the range 0.007 to 0.015, and heliocentric distances between 1640 and 5203 pc. The total stellar masses of the clusters were estimated to lie between 257 and 1916 solar masses. For most of the clusters, the mass function slopes are consistent with the Salpeter initial mass function. Our dynamical analysis indicates that all clusters, except Ruprecht 15, are dynamically relaxed. In addition, the spatial distribution and the bimodal structure observed in the radial density profile of NGC 7245 provide strong evidence that this object is a binary cluster candidate. Finally, kinematic analysis and orbit integrations demonstrate that all clusters exhibit dynamical properties fully consistent with membership in the Galactic thin disc.

 - **Abstract**
 The Sloan Digital Sky Survey-V (SDSS-V) Magellanic Genesis survey is a spectroscopic program designed to map the kinematic and chemical structure of the Magellanic Clouds using APOGEE and BOSS spectroscopy. This overview describes the survey's design, target selection, and science goals, and highlights some first results using these data. In the inner regions of the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds (LMC and SMC), the survey obtained high-resolution near-infrared APOGEE spectra (S/N~45) of ~14,000 bright, oxygen-rich asymptotic giant branch (AGB-O) stars. These data provide contiguous spatial coverage of the Clouds' main bodies, enabling detailed chemo-dynamical studies. To explore extended structures, the survey includes BOSS optical spectroscopy of fainter red giant (RG) stars selected with \gaia~DR3 data, reaching G~17.5. Many of these targets extend to the outer regions of the Clouds, which are known to span ~20 deg (LMC) and ~12 deg(SMC) and contain diffuse substructures of unclear origin. BOSS data in the inner regions also complement APOGEE by providing elements inaccessible in the near-infrared and enabling cross-calibration between instruments. The survey further includes APOGEE and BOSS observations of ~300 evolved massive stars and a small sample of symbiotic binaries previously observed by APOGEE-1 and -2, enhancing our understanding of massive stellar evolution and complementing the SDSS-V main-sequence massive star program.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding planetary habitability requires a comparative approach that explores the divergent evolutionary outcomes of Earth and Venus. The Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) will be uniquely positioned to conduct a statistical and physical census of terrestrial exoplanets spanning the Venus Zone (VZ) and the Habitable Zone (HZ), enabling the detection and atmospheric characterization of post-runaway greenhouse worlds (``exoVenuses''). We present an updated list of VZ exoplanets, which raises the number of known candidates to 370. We describe a science case and an observing strategy for VZ exoplanets that integrates precursor exoplanet detection data and stellar characterization with HWO direct imaging, spectroscopy across the UV/optical/IR, and spectropolarimetry. Our proposed framework emphasizes a pathway toward the diagnosis of sulfur chemistry (SO$_2$) and aerosol physics (H$_2$SO$_4$ clouds/hazes), planetary redox states (O$_2$/O$_3$ false positives from hydrogen loss), and cloud microphysics detection (rainbow polarization). We quantify implications for HWO requirements, including UV access to 0.2--0.4 $\mu$m, optical/NIR coverage to $\gtrsim$1.5 $\mu$m, inner working angle (IWA) reaching 0.3--1.5 AU around nearby Sun-like stars, and the SNR/resolution needed for key features. Finally, we outline a community-driven path to producing robust demographic inferences and target selection for optimizing HWO observations.

 - **Abstract**
 Observations of ultra-hot Jupiters offer an unprecedented opportunity to study the physics of some of the most extreme planetary atmospheres known. With exceedingly high amounts of irradiation blasting their upper atmospheres, ultra-hot Jupiters have dayside temperatures comparable to some late type stars enabling refractory metals otherwise condensed in colder planets to exist in the gas phase, all the while still maintaining comparatively cool nightsides. The ensuing intense temperature contrasts can give rise not only to strong day-to-night winds, but also to vastly different chemical and cloud properties on opposing hemispheres. With its ability to resolve spectral features that are unique to individual chemical species, high resolution spectroscopy can unambiguously disentangle atmospheric signals of exoplanetary origin, which follow a well-defined Keplerian motion, from stationary or pseudo-stationary telluric and stellar lines. Combined, the high temperature of ultra-hot Jupiters providing access to refractory metals with narrow spectral features and the ability of high-resolution spectroscopy to resolve said narrow lines provides access to a wealth of information about these atmospheres that would otherwise be unavailable at lower resolving powers or for other types of planets. In this chapter we explore some of the key physical and chemical transitions that differentiate ultra-hot Jupiters from their colder counterparts and highlight the unique opportunities arising from probing their atmospheres using high resolution spectroscopy.

 - **Abstract**
 The surface-brightness-color (SBC) relationship for Red Clump stars provides a critical foundation for precision distance ladder measurements, including the 1\% distance determination to the Large Magellanic Cloud. Current SBC calibrations rely on angular diameter measurements of nearby Red Clump stars obtained through long-baseline optical interferometry using the Very Large Telescope Interferometer. We explore the application of intensity interferometry to measure limb-darkened angular diameters of Red Clump stars, offering a complementary approach to traditional amplitude interferometry. We describe the framework for extracting angular diameters from squared visibility measurements in intensity interferometry, accounting for limb darkening through the stellar atmosphere models. For the Red Clump star HD~17652, we show that intensity interferometry in the $H$ band at baselines matching PIONIER ($\sim$100~m) could achieve $<1$\% angular size uncertainties in 2-hour exposures by measuring the primary peak of the visibility function, enabling direct comparison with existing measurements. Critically, observations at shorter wavelengths probe the secondary visibility maximum, providing independent checks of both measurement and systematic errors that are largely insensitive to limb-darkening assumptions. Exploiting the multiplex advantage of simultaneous multi-bandpass observations and the large number of baselines available with telescope arrays such as the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory can reduce observing times to practical levels, making intensity interferometry a viable tool for validating the angular sizes for a subset of the Red Clump star calibration sample.

 - **Abstract**
 Reliable nebular emission line diagnostics are essential for accurately inferring the physical properties (e.g. electron temperature, density, pressure, and metallicity) of H II regions from spectra. When interpreting spectra, it is typical to adopt a single zone model, e.g. at fixed density, pressure, or temperature, to infer H II region properties. However, such an assumption may not fully capture the complexities of a turbulent interstellar medium. To understand how a complex density field driven by supersonic turbulence impacts nebular emission lines, we simulate 3D H II regions surrounding a single O star, both with and without supersonic turbulence. We find that turbulence directly impacts the values of common strong line ratios. For example turbulent H II regions exhibit systematically higher [N II]/H$\alpha$, lower [O III]/H$\beta$, and lower O32, compared to homogeneous H II regions with the same mean density and ionizing source. These biases can impact inferences of metallicity, ionization parameter, excitation, and ionization source. For our choice of turbulence, direct $T_e$ method metallicity inferences are biased low, by up to 0.1 dex, which is important for metallicity studies, but not enough to explain the abundance discrepancy problem. Finally, we show that large differences between measured electron densities emerge between infrared, optical, and UV density indicators. Our results motivate the need for large grids of turbulent H II regions models that span the range of conditions seen at both high and low redshift to better interpret observed spectra.
#### FORGE'd in the Early Universe: The Effect of Protostellar Outflows on Pop III Accretion

 - **Abstract**
 We present a cosmological zoom-in radiation magneto-hydrodynamic (RMHD) simulation, using FORGE'd in FIRE, that follows the formation, growth, and evolution of a single metal-free Pop. III (proto)star at redshift $z \sim 14$. The simulation captures a rotationally supported circumstellar disk and protostellar jets, both resolved down to $<100$ au scales. We find the star grows to $\sim 27$ M$_{\odot}$ over $31,000$ years, with its final mass regulated by accretion and protostellar jets. Protostellar jets form because the magnetic mass-to-flux ratio lies within the regime that allows jet launching, and they are further enabled by a rotating circumstellar disk with sufficient gas-magnetic-field coupling, both present in this simulation. These jets regulate accretion onto the (proto)star and drive outflows that collide with infalling gas, slowing inflow at large radii due to the substantial momentum they carry. A circumstellar disk forms, extending out to $\sim 0.01$ pc, which remains gravitationally stable (Q $\gg 1$). The stability of the disk is maintained through both thermal support and turbulence. In this paper we focus on how jets play a critical role not only in shaping the final masses of Pop. III stars but also in directly influencing their surroundings by regulating accretion. These results will provide important insights into the initial mass function and feedback processes in the earliest star-forming regions of the Universe.
#### Evidence for a 3.0$σ$ Deviation in Gravitational Light Deflection from General Relativity at Cosmological Scales with KiDS-Legacy and CMB Lensing

 - **Abstract**
 General Relativity (GR) faces challenges from cosmic acceleration and observational tensions, necessitating stringent tests at cosmological scales. In this work, we probe GR deviations via a $\mu$-$\Sigma$ modified gravity parameterization, integrating KiDS-Legacy weak lensing (1347 deg$^2$, $z\leq 2.0$), joint CMB data (Planck/ACT/SPT), DESI DR2 BAO, and DES-Dovekie supernovae. KiDS-Legacy significantly improves constraint precision: $\mu_0$ (matter clustering) by $\sim 43\%$ and $\Sigma_0$ (gravitational light deflection) by $\sim 60\%$ relative to CMB alone. In the $\Lambda$CDM background, $\mu_0 = 0.21\pm 0.21$ is consistent with GR, while $\Sigma_0 = 0.149\pm 0.051$ deviates from GR at the 3.0$\sigma$ level -- attributed to large-scale CMB lensing from ACT/SPT. This precise separation of GR-consistent matter clustering and deviant light deflection provides key observational clues for new physics or data systematics. Our work underscores the critical role of synergizing high-precision CMB and WL data in advancing GR tests.
#### Digging into the chemical complexity in the outer Galaxy: A hot molecular core in Sharpless 2-283

 - **Abstract**
 The outer Galaxy (galactocentric distance $\gtrsim$13.5 kpc) serves as an excellent laboratory for investigating the chemical complexity in low-metallicity environments. Here, we present the chemical analyses for the outer Galactic hot core Sh 2-283-1a SMM1 ($D_\mathrm{GC}$ = 15.7 kpc and $Z$ $\sim$0.3 $Z_\odot$), recently detected by Ikeda et al. (2025) using ALMA. Toward this source, a variety of molecular species, including complex organic molecules (COMs: CH$_3$OH, $^{13}$CH$_3$OH, CH$_2$DOH, and CH$_3$OCH$_3$) are detected. The molecular abundances relative to CH$_3$OH are similar to those of another outer Galactic hot core, demonstrating that chemically rich hot cores exist in different regions of the outer Galaxy. We also compared molecular abundances among hot cores in the inner Galaxy, outer Galaxy, and Magellanic Clouds. This comparison revealed that the metallicity-corrected $N$(SO$_2$)/$N$(H$_2$) ratios of outer Galactic hot cores are significantly lower than those of the inner Galactic ones, while their $N$(CH$_3$OH)/$N$(H$_2$) ratios are similar. The Magellanic hot cores show different trends despite having metallicities similar to those of the outer Galaxy, indicating that the chemical complexity of hot cores is governed by environmental conditions (e.g., cosmic ray intensity and dust temperature) rather than simple metallicity scaling. These environmental differences would also affect the production efficiency of COMs derived from CH$_3$OH, as the $N$(CH$_3$OCH$_3$)/$N$(CH$_3$OH) and $N$(C$_2$H$_5$OH)/$N$(CH$_3$OH) ratios in the outer Galactic sources are moderately lower than those of inner Galactic sources. The $N$(CH$_2$DOH)/$N$(CH$_3$OH) ratio of Sh 2-283-1a SMM1 is 1.5$^{+3.9}_{-1.2}$$\%$, comparable to that of inner Galactic high-mass sources.

 - **Abstract**
 We report on the periodic flux variations in the 6.7 GHz $\mathrm{CH_3OH}$ maser associated with the high-mass protostar G353.273+0.641, based on 13 yr of monitoring mainly by the Hitachi 32 m telescope. We identified a periodicity of 309 days based on a nearly complete light curve, with 833 epochs every few days. A strong correlation is found between the maser and the mid-infrared fluxes at 3.4 and 4.6 $\mu$m observed by NEOWISE during these periods, suggesting that the maser emission responds to variations in the protostellar luminosity. The average profile of the maser light curve is asymmetric and shows a steep drop in intensity just before the brightening, resembling that of some pulsating variable stars. Assuming a protostellar pulsation as the origin of maser periodicity, the observed period implies a cool and highly bloated, red supergiant-like structure. Such a bloated structure is consistent with a theoretical model of protostellar evolution under high accretion rates. The inferred protostellar parameters are broadly consistent with the theoretical model of pulsational instability during the early phase of high-mass star formation. However, a periodic accretion scenario caused by an unresolved compact protobinary cannot be completely ruled out. Several irregular peaks that deviate from the periodicity may result from episodic accretion phenomena or jet-launching events independent of the protostellar pulsation. Extremely high-resolution imaging with next-generation interferometers such as the ngVLA will provide a conclusive test for both the protostellar pulsation and the binary accretion scenarios.

 - **Abstract**
 The distinct formation pathways of directly-imaged exoplanets and isolated brown dwarfs might leave imprints in the inherited elemental and isotopic abundances, but such measurements require careful characterisation of the atmospheres. In particular, L-T transition objects exhibit signs of dynamics that drive their atmospheres out of chemical equilibrium. In this work, we studied the nearest L-T brown dwarfs, Luhman 16A and B, to assess the chemical dis-equilibrium in their atmospheres and to investigate their elemental and isotopic composition. As part of the ESO SupJup Survey, we obtained high-resolution CRIRES$^+$ K-band spectra of the binary, which were analysed using an atmospheric retrieval framework. We detect and retrieve the abundances of $^{12}$CO, H$_2$O, CH$_4$, NH$_3$, H$_2$S, HF, and the $^{13}$CO isotopologue. Both atmospheres are in chemical dis-equilibrium with somewhat stronger vertical mixing in Luhman 16A compared to B ($K_\mathrm{zz,A}\sim10^{8.7}$, $K_\mathrm{zz,B}\sim10^{8.2}\ \mathrm{cm^2\ s^{-1}}$). The tested chemical models, free- and dis-equilibrium chemistry, yield consistent mixing ratios and agree with earlier work at shorter wavelengths. The gaseous C/O ratios show evidence of oxygen trapping in silicate-oxide clouds. While the C/O ratios are consistent with solar, the metallicities are modestly enhanced with $\mathrm{[C/H]}\sim0.15$. The carbon isotope ratios are measured at $\mathrm{^{12}C/^{13}C_A}=74^{+2}_{-2}$ and $\mathrm{^{12}C/^{13}C_B}=74^{+3}_{-3}$. The coincident constraints of metallicities and isotopes across the binary reinforce their likely shared formation. The $\mathrm{^{12}C/^{13}C}$ ratios are aligned with the present-day interstellar medium, but lower than the solar-system value. This suggests a recent inheritance and corroborates the relatively young age ($\sim500$ Myr) of Luhman 16AB as members of the Oceanus moving group.

 - **Abstract**
 Young transiting exoplanets provide unique opportunities to probe planetary atmospheres during the critical early phases of evolution. HIP~67522~b, a 17~Myr old hot Jupiter with an extraordinarily low bulk density, represents an ideal target for high-resolution transmission spectroscopy. We aim to characterize the atmospheric composition, thermal structure, and dynamics of HIP~67522~b using ground-based high-resolution near-infrared spectroscopy. We obtained high-resolution spectra with VLT/CRIRES+ in the K2166 band during a transit on 30 January 2025. We applied cross-correlation techniques and Bayesian nested sampling retrievals to constrain molecular abundances, temperature structure, and atmospheric dynamics. We detect H$_2$O at 20$\sigma$ and CO at 5$\sigma$, confirming the extremely extended atmosphere of this low-mass giant. A velocity offset of $-2.9 \pm 0.2$~km~s$^{-1}$ indicates day-to-night winds. The rotation velocity is constrained to $<1.8$~km~s$^{-1}$ at 3$\sigma$, consistent with tidal locking. Retrieval analysis suggests a planetary mass of 29.8 $\pm$ 3 Earth masses and a vertically isothermal atmosphere. This mass is two times larger than the mass estimated from JWST atmospheric observations and inconsistent at 3$\sigma$ hence leaving a doubt on the actual planetary density of the planet. Using the mass derived derived from the CRIRES+ data, we derive a C/O ratio of $0.83 \pm 0.09$, about 1.5 times solar, and a subsolar metallicity [C+O/H]~$= -0.8 \pm 0.4$ which can be increased if the atmosphere is cloudy, a degeneracy our data alone cannot resolve. We report a tentative 2$\sigma$ detection of HDO with an extreme enrichment factor of $\sim$1000 relative to the protosolar D/H ratio. If confirmed, this would be the first detection of deuterium in an exoplanet atmosphere and would require intense escape rate to be explained.

 - **Abstract**
 Quasi-periodic pulsations (QPPs) are oscillatory signatures commonly detected in the light curves of solar and stellar flares, offering valuable diagnostics of the underlying magnetic and plasma processes. This review compares the observational characteristics, detection methods, and physical interpretations of QPPs in both solar and stellar contexts. Solar flare QPPs, extensively studied in X-rays and EUV bands using instruments such as GOES, STIX, and Fermi, display typical periods of tens of seconds and show correlations with flare duration and magnetic loop length. Stellar QPPs, observed in X-rays and white light by missions such as Kepler, TESS, and XMM-Newton, exhibit much longer periods - ranging from minutes to hours - consistent with larger-scale magnetic structures in more active stars. Despite differences in scale and observing band, statistical and comparative studies reveal common scaling relations and damping behaviors, suggesting that both solar and stellar QPPs are manifestations of the same fundamental mechanisms, likely magnetohydrodynamic oscillations or oscillatory reconnection within flare loops. The comparison underscores a continuity between solar and stellar magnetic activity, linking the solar detailed physical processes to stellar-scale phenomena and providing constraints for future models and surveys.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the results of three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic (3D MHD) simulations of the plasma flow structure in the vicinity of a compact cluster of young massive stars. The cluster is considered at the evolutionary stage dominated by Wolf-Rayet stars. This stage occurs in clusters with ages of several million years, close to the onset of supernova explosions; the well-known objects Westerlund 1 and 2 are the prototypes. The collisions of powerful winds from massive stars in the cluster core, calculated as interactions of individual outflows, are accompanied by their partial thermalization and produce a collective cluster wind. The MHD dynamics of the cluster wind bubble expansion into the interstellar medium is considered, depending on the density of the surrounding medium with a uniform magnetic field. We show that when expanding into a cold neutral medium, the cluster wind is able to reshape its surrounding environment over the Wolf-Rayet star lifetime, sweeping up more than $10^4$ $M_{\odot}$ of gas in $\sim 2 \times 10^5$ yr and producing extended, thin and dense shells with an amplified magnetic field. In a cold neutral medium with a density of $\sim 20$ cm$^{-3}$ and a magnetic field of $\sim 3.5$ $\mu$G, a thin shell forms around the cluster wind bubble, characterized by a cellular structure in its density and magnetic field distributions. The cellular magnetic field structure appears in parts of the shell expanding transversely to the orientation of the external magnetic field. Magnetic fields in the shell are amplified to strengths $\gtrsim 50$ $\mu$G. The formation of the cellular structure is associated with the development of instabilities. The expansion of the bubble into a warm neutral interstellar medium also leads to the formation of a shell with an amplified magnetic field.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent theoretical and observational analysis of the interaction between the Milky Way (MW) and LMC suggest that it has a significant dynamical impact on the MW's stellar halo. We investigate this effect using simulations from the Latte project, a simulation suite from the Feedback In Realistic Environments 2 (FIRE-2) Project. By comparing simulations with and without an LMC-analog interaction, we show that fully cosmological LMC interactions create prominent velocity asymmetry in the stellar halo of the MW, resulting from both barycentric displacement (the "reflex motion") and the dynamical wake of the LMC. The strength and direction of this asymmetry depend on the mass ratio at pericenter and orbit of the LMC analog. We perform a spherical-harmonic decomposition of the velocities of halo star particles to confirm that the identified signatures are LMC-induced and persist even when LMC star particles are removed. We also show that this strategy separates and individually detects the dipole (l=1) of the global reflex motion and the quadrupole (l=2) of the local wake. These asymmetries are consistent with those identified in previous work using non-cosmological simulations; the dipole is easily distinguishable from other complex halo substructure using spherical harmonics while the quadrupole is sometimes confused. These findings support the detectability of MW--LMC interaction signatures in upcoming observational surveys of the MW stellar halo.

 - **Abstract**
 Deuterium fractionation is highly efficient during the early stages of star formation, particularly in starless and prestellar cores where temperatures are low (<10 K) and molecular freeze-out onto dust grains is significant. Methanol forms early in these environments following CO freeze-out via successive hydrogenation reactions on grain surfaces, while the production of deuterated methanol requires elevated gas-phase D/H ratios generated through dissociative recombination of deuterated H3+. Consequently, large abundances of deuterated methanol are observed toward young stellar objects where prestellar ices have recently sublimated. Here, we present laboratory infrared spectra of methanol and its deuterated isotopologues in astrophysical ice analogues, complemented by anharmonic vibrational calculations used to guide band assignments. Experiments were performed at the CASICE laboratory using a Bruker Vertex 70v spectrometer coupled to a closed-cycle helium cryostat, with isotopologue ices deposited at 10 K under high-vacuum conditions. Infrared transmission spectra were recorded over 6000-30 cm-1 (1.67-333 um) and compared with spectra of pure isotopologue ices. Distinctive mid-infrared band patterns are identified for each deuterated species. In particular, CH2DOH exhibits a characteristic doublet at 1293 and 1326 cm-1 (7.73 and 7.54 um), while CHD2OH shows a similar doublet at 1301 and 1329 cm-1 (7.69 and 7.52 um), both remaining largely invariant across all studied ice mixtures. These robust spectral signatures provide reliable tracers for identifying deuterated methanol in JWST observations and for constraining astrochemical gas-grain models of deuterium enrichment prior to star and planet formation.

 Tidal interactions play a crucial role in the orbital evolution of close-in star-planet systems. There are numerous manifestations of tides, including planetary orbital migration, breaking resonant chains, tidal heating, orbital circularization, spin-orbit alignment, and stellar and planetary spin synchronization. In the present study, we focus on the dissipation of internal gravity waves within stars. We examine two mechanisms: wave breaking in stars with radiative cores and magnetic wave conversion in stars with convective cores. Applying tidal prescriptions modelling these processes, we demonstrate that the enhanced stellar rotation of both TOI-2458 and GJ 504 can be explained by the previous engulfment of a hot Jupiter caused by gravity wave damping. Furthermore, we show that the observed population of hot Jupiters can be divided into two distinct subsamples: those that are too young for gravity wave dissipation and those where it is ongoing. These subsamples exhibit qualitatively different orbital period distributions: young systems have a uniform distribution, while older systems show a steep decline at short orbital periods. Using a population synthesis approach, we successfully reproduce the main features of the older hot Jupiter sample based on the distribution of the younger systems. According to our estimates, up to 20% of the main-sequence stars within the mass range [0.7,1.5] $M_{\odot}$ that once hosted a hot Jupiter may have since engulfed it. Our results highlight the key role of internal gravity wave dissipation in shaping the orbital architectures of hot Jupiter systems.

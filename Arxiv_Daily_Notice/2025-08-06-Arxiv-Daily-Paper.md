#### A Multi-Scale Attention-Enhanced Architecture for Gravity Wave Localization in Satellite Imagery

 - **Abstract**
 Satellite images present unique challenges due to their high object variability and lower spatial resolution, particularly for detecting atmospheric gravity waves which exhibit significant variability in scale, shape, and pattern extent, making accurate localization highly challenging. This variability is further compounded by dominant unwanted objects such as clouds and city lights, as well as instrumental noise, all within a single image channel, while conventional detection methods struggle to capture the diverse and often subtle features of gravity waves across varying conditions. To address these issues, we introduce YOLO-DCAT incorporating Multi Dilated Residual Convolution (MDRC) and Simplified Spatial and Channel Attention (SSCA), an enhanced version of YOLOv5 specifically designed to improve gravity wave localization by effectively handling their complex and variable characteristics. MDRC captures multi-scale features through parallel dilated convolutions with varying dilation rates, while SSCA focuses on the most relevant spatial regions and channel features to enhance detection accuracy and suppress interference from background noise. In our experiments, the improved model outperformed state-of-the-art alternatives, improving mean Average Precision (mAP) by over 14% and Intersection over Union (IoU) by approximately 17%, demonstrating significantly improved localization accuracy for gravity waves in challenging satellite imagery and contributing to more precise climate research and modeling.

 - **Abstract**
 The prevalence and properties of low-mass dark matter haloes serve as a crucial test for understanding the nature of dark matter, and may be constrained through the gravitational deflection of strongly lensed arcs. Previous studies found evidence for the presence of low-mass dark matter haloes in observations of the gravitationally lensed, dusty star-forming galaxy SDP.81, using the Atacama Large Millimetre/sub-millimetre Array (ALMA). In this work, we analyse these observations to assess the robustness of these reported results. While our analysis indicates that the data support additional angular structure in the lensing mass distribution beyond an elliptical power-law density profile, we do not find evidence for two previously reported sub-halo detections. However, we verify with realistic mock data that we could have found evidence in favour of a previously reported $\approx 10^{9}\,{\rm M_{\odot}}$ sub-halo with a log Bayes factor of 29, should it exist in the real data. After testing various systematics, we find that this previous sub-halo inference was most likely spurious and resulted from an inadequate smooth model, specifically, poorly fitting multipoles. While we do not find evidence in favour of any individual sub-halo, we find evidence for similarity in the lensing signatures of multipoles ($m=3,4$) and single massive sub-haloes, consistent with other recent work. We suggest that future searches for low-mass haloes in lensed arcs include lens angular structure in the form of multipoles up to 4th order and require a good-fitting smooth model as a prerequisite. Overall, our findings demonstrate the suitability of ALMA data of this quality to simultaneously constrain the abundance of low-mass haloes and lens angular structure.
#### Survey of (sub)mm water masers in low-mass star-forming regions

 - **Abstract**
 Water masers are common in star-forming regions (SFRs), with the 22.235 GHz transition widely detected in both high- and low-mass protostars. In contrast, (sub)millimeter water maser transitions remain poorly studied, especially in low-mass SFRs. We search for millimeter water masers in a sample of low-mass SFRs previously known to exhibit 22 GHz emission. We target the transitions at 183.3, 321.2, and 325.2 GHz, respectively. We also examine their potential as probes of evolutionary stage by comparing them with previously reported Class I methanol masers (MM). We used the APEX 12m telescope. To assess the evolutionary stage of each source, we modeled their spectral energy distributions (SEDs) using archival data and used the derived dust temperatures as proxies of ages. We then compared the occurrence of water and methanol masers across the sample. We detected 183.3 GHz water masers in 5 out of 18 sources. IRAS 16293-2422 shows all three transitions, while Serpens FIRS 1 also displays the 321.2 GHz line. Despite excellent observing conditions, detection rates drop with increasing frequency, reflecting both intrinsic line weakness and variability. Notably, the brightest (sub)millimeter masers can reach flux densities comparable to the 22 GHz line. Comparisons of velocity profiles show that different transitions often trace distinct gas components. Water masers generally appear at earlier or comparable evolutionary stages than MM, suggesting no universal maser-based age sequence. Our results demonstrate the detectability of submillimeter water in low-mass SFRs, although their occurrence is sparse. Velocity overlap between some centimeter and millimeter components suggests partial spatial coincidence, but many features appear uniquely in one frequency regime, indicating that different transitions often trace distinct gas regions with varying physical conditions.

 - **Abstract**
 Faraday rotation measure synthesis is a well-known approach originated in Burn (1966) and later developed by Sokoloff et al. (1998) and Brentjens \& de Bruyn (2005) for studying magnetic fields. This work presents a complementary approach--the polarization frequency analysis (PFA)--allowing the properties of the turbulent magnetic field, which are difficult for Burn's original approach. Based on synthetic polarization observation of MHD turbulence simulation data, we study the influence of the coupling effect between density and magnetic field on synchrotron polarization dispersion. By applying the PFA to different simulated interstellar turbulence environments, we find that the PFA technique can reveal the scaling slope of the turbulent magnetic field in the case of a weak coupling effect and can also reflect the scaling slope of the rotation measure in the case of a strong coupling effect. Since avoiding the influence of Faraday depolarization, the PFA technique is a promising way to uncover turbulence properties using observational data from the Low-Frequency Array for Radio Astronomy and the Square Kilometer Array.

 - **Abstract**
 To understand the underlying mechanisms for high lithium abundances among core He-burning or red clump (RC) giants, we analyzed a sample of 5227 RC giants of mass M $\leq$ 2~M$_{\odot}$ using spectra and asteroseismic data. We found 120 RC giants ($\sim$2~$\%$) with a lower limit of A(Li) = 0.7~dex, a factor of 40 more than their predecessors close to the RGB tip. Of the 120 RC giants, we could measure actual rotations for 16 RC giants using stellar spots from the Kepler light curve analysis. We found that most of the high rotation RC giants are also very high Li-rich RC giants, and the rotation seems to decline rapidly with Li abundance depletion, suggesting that both the high rotation and high Li abundance are transient phenomena and associated with a single source. Further, we found a significantly high occurrence of 15~$\%$ and 12~$\%$ of Li-rich RC giants among extremely low-mass RC giants and RC giants with anomalous [C/N] ratios, respectively. The extremely low mass, fast rotation and anomalous [C/N] values of RC giants are attributed to their past binary interaction/merger history. The results pose a question of whether the binary interaction/merger is a prerequisite along with the He-flash for Li-enhancement among RC giants.
#### Protostellar Outflows at the EarliesT Stages (POETS). VIII. The jets in the intermediate-mass star-forming region G105.42+9.88 (alias LkHα 234)

 - **Abstract**
 Our aim is to investigate the protostellar jets inside the young stellar object (YSO) cluster G105.42+9.88 (alias LkH$\alpha$ 234). This is one of the least luminous targets of the Protostellar Outflows at the EarliesT Stages (POETS) survey, which has been recently carried out to study young outflow emission on scales of 10-100 au. The combination of multi-epoch water maser very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) observations with sensitive Jansky Very Large Array (JVLA) continuum and Large Binocular Telescope (LBT) H$_2$ 2.12 $\mu$m observations, allows us to study the protostellar outflows from the intermediate-mass binary system VLA 3A and 3B, separated by ~0.22", and from VLA 2, an intermediate-mass YSO placed ~1" to northwest of VLA 3. Toward VLA 2, the 2001 and 2011 Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) observations consistently show that the water masers are tracing a jet. The analysis of the 3D flow velocities proves that the jet is magneto-centrifugally launched in a magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) disk wind (DW). We infer launch radii in the range 10-50 au for the streamlines traced by the water masers. The global VLBI 2023 water maser observations indicate that the jet propagation can be hindered by a very dense clump placed northeast of VLA 2 and that is consistent with the large-scale LBT H$_2$ emission, tracing only the southwest lobe of the VLA 2 jet. Instead, the parallel jets emitted by the nearby YSOs VLA 3A and 3B can be reliably tracked with the H$_2$ emission at scales of a few 10" to both the southwest and the northeast. In particular, northeast of VLA 3 the direction of these two jets crosses a linear chain of spaced H$_2$ knots, which is a clear signature of an episodic jet. The variable ejection from VLA 3B, witnessed by the water masers at scales of ~10 au, could be the origin of the episodic jet observed at larger scales.

 - **Abstract**
 The Querying Underlying mechanisms of massive star formation with ALMA-Resolved gas Kinematics and Structures (QUARKS) survey observed 139 infrared-bright (IR-bright) massive protoclusters at 1.3 mm wavelength with ALMA. This study investigates clump-to-core fragmentation and searches for candidate high-mass starless cores within IR-bright clumps using combined ALMA 12-m (C-2) and Atacama Compact Array (ACA) 7-m data, providing $\sim$ 1 arcsec ($\sim\rm0.02~pc$ at 3.7 kpc) resolution and $\sim\rm0.6\,mJy\,beam^{-1}$ continuum sensitivity ($\sim 0.3~M_{\odot}$ at 30 K). We identified 1562 compact cores from 1.3 mm continuum emission using getsf. Observed linear core separations ($\lambda_{\rm obs}$) are significantly less than the thermal Jeans length ($\lambda_{\rm J}$), with the $\lambda_{\rm obs}/\lambda_{\rm J}$ ratios peaking at $\sim0.2$. This indicates that thermal Jeans fragmentation has taken place within the IR-bright protocluster clumps studied here. The observed low ratio of $\lambda_{\rm obs}/\lambda_{\rm J}\ll 1$ could be the result of evolving core separation or hierarchical fragmentation. Based on associated signatures of star formation (e.g., outflows and ionized gas), we classified cores into three categories: 127 starless, 971 warm, and 464 evolved cores. Two starless cores have mass exceeding 16$\,M_{\odot}$, and represent high-mass candidates. The scarcity of such candidates suggests that competitive accretion-type models could be more applicable than turbulent core accretion-type models in high-mass star formation within these IR-bright protocluster clumps.
#### The possibility of a giant impact on Venus

 - **Abstract**
 Giant impacts were common in the early evolution of the Solar System, and it is possible that Venus also experienced an impact. A giant impact on Venus could have affected its rotation rate and possibly its thermal evolution. In this work, we explore a range of possible impacts using smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH). We consider the final major collision, assuming that differentiation already occurred and that Venus consists of an iron core (30% of Venus' mass) and a forsterite mantle (70% of Venus' mass). We use differentiated impactors with masses ranging from 0.01 to 0.1 Earth masses, impact velocities between 10 and 15 km/s, various impact geometries (head-on and oblique), different primordial thermal profiles, and a range of pre-impact rotation rates of Venus. We analyse the post-impact rotation periods and debris disc masses to identify scenarios that can reproduce Venus' present-day characteristics. Our findings show that a wide range of impact scenarios are consistent with Venus' current rotation. These include head-on collisions on a non-rotating Venus and oblique, hit-and-run impacts by Mars-sized bodies on a rotating Venus. Importantly, collisions that match Venus' present-day rotation rate typically produce minimal debris discs residing within Venus' synchronous orbit. This suggests that the material would likely reaccrete onto the planet, preventing the formation of long-lasting satellites - consistent with Venus' lack of a moon. We conclude that a giant impact can be consistent with both Venus' unusual rotation and lack of a moon, potentially setting the stage for its subsequent thermal evolution.
#### Spatial mixing of stellar populations in globular clusters via binary-single star scattering

 - **Abstract**
 The majority of Galactic globular star clusters (GCs) have been reported to contain at least two populations of stars (we use P1 for the primordial and P2 for the chemically-enriched population). Recent observational studies found that dynamically-old GCs have P1 and P2 spatially mixed due to relaxation processes. However, in dynamically-young GCs, where P2 is expected to be more centrally concentrated from birth, the spatial distributions of P1 and P2 are sometimes very different from system to system. This suggests that more complex dynamical processes specific to certain GCs might have shaped those distributions. We aim to investigate the discrepancies between the spatial concentration of P1 and P2 stars in dynamically-young GCs. Our focus is to evaluate whether massive binary stars (e.g. BHs) can cause the expansion of the P2 stars through binary-single interactions in the core, and whether they can mix or even radially invert the P1 and P2 distributions. We use a set of theoretical and empirical arguments to evaluate the effectiveness of binary-single star scattering. We then construct a set of direct N-body models with massive primordial binaries to verify our estimates further and gain more insights into the dynamical processes in GCs. We find that binary-single star scatterings can push the central P2 stars outwards within a few relaxation times. While we do not produce radial inversion of P1 and P2 for any initial conditions we tested, this mechanism systematically produces clusters where P1 and P2 look fully mixed even in projection. The mixing is enhanced 1) in denser GCs, 2) in GCs containing more binary stars, and 3) when the mass ratio between the binary components and the cluster members is higher. Binary-single star interactions seem able to explain the observable properties of some dynamically-young GCs (e.g. NGC4590 or NGC5904) where P1 and P2 are fully radially mixed.

 - **Abstract**
 Aperture photometry is a fundamental technique widely used to obtain high-precision light curves in optical survey projects like Tianyu. However, its effectiveness is limited in crowded fields, and the choice of aperture size critically impacts photometric precision. To address these challenges, we propose DeepAP, an efficient and accurate two-stage deep learning framework for aperture photometry. Specifically, for a given source, we first train a Vision Transformer (ViT) model to assess its feasibility of aperture photometry. We then train the Residual Neural Network (ResNet) to predict its optimal aperture size. For aperture photometry feasibility assessment, the ViT model yields an ROC AUC value of 0.96, and achieves a precision of 0.974, a recall of 0.930, and an F1 score of 0.952 on the test set. For aperture size prediction, the ResNet model effectively mitigates biases inherent in classical growth curve methods by adaptively selecting apertures appropriate for sources of varying brightness, thereby enhancing the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) across a wide range of targets. Meanwhile, some samples in the test set have a higher SNR than those obtained by exhaustive aperture size enumeration because of the finer granularity of aperture size estimation. By integrating ResNet with the ViT network, the DeepAP framework achieves a median total processing time of 18 milliseconds for a batch of 10 images, representing a speed-up of approximately 59000 times compared to exhaustive aperture size enumeration. This work paves the way for the automatic application of aperture photometry in future high-precision surveys such as Tianyu and LSST. The source code and model are available at this https URL.

 - **Abstract**
 Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and carbonaceous dust have been observed in clumpy circumstellar environments, yet their formation and evolutionary pathways in such environments remain elusive. We aim to characterize the PAH emission in a clumpy planetary nebula to decipher their formation and evolution pathways. We obtained JWST Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) and Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) integral field unit spectroscopic observations of two individual knots in the Ring Nebula (NGC 6720), a clumpy planetary nebula, and determine the PAH spectral characteristics. We detect the 3.3 and 11.2 um PAH emission bands in both knots but do not detect PAH emission in the 6-9 um range. We supplement our data with Spitzer Infrared Spectrograph (IRS) Short-Low 1 (SL1) and SL2 data, containing 11.2, weak 6.2, and weak 7.7 um PAH emission bands. The JWST data confirm the unusual profile of the 11.2 um band, which is very broad and redshifted with respect to typical 11.2 um PAH profiles. We estimate the PAH population to be largely neutral. The relative integrated surface brightness of the 3.3 and 11.2 um bands indicates the presence of small-sized PAHs, consisting of 35 +/- 6 carbon atoms. We find that the PAH emission is concentrated outside of the clumps, in the inter-clump medium, and confirm the existence of enhanced PAH emission in a narrow 'PAH ring' centred on the central star. This morphology suggests that PAHs formed during the Ring Nebula's asymptotic giant branch phase, in the central star's dust-driven wind.

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.03463

 - **Abstract**
 We perform a suite of numerical simulations of tidal disruption events, using smoothed particle hydrodynamics, for a close binary system consisting of two low-mass white dwarfs, and an intermediate mass non-spinning black hole. The binary components are considered to be detached and on the same plane with the black hole. Our results quantify how the outcomes of these events depend crucially on the positional configuration of the binary components at the orbital pericenter, and we also show how distinctive behaviour for non-identical mass binaries arise, as compared to identical ones. We highlight these differences on observables such as mass fallback rates, kick velocities and gravitational waves, and also compute clump formation time within the stellar debris. In our setup, prograde binary motion, where the angular momentum of the binary is in the same direction as that of the center of mass motion around the black hole, is qualitatively similar to multiple events of single star tidal disruptions. However, we argue that interactions between stellar debris in the corresponding retrograde scenarios result in different and distinct outcomes. Our results should serve as indicative benchmarks in the observational aspects of tidal interactions between close white dwarf binaries and intermediate mass black holes.
#### Radiative Nonideal MHD Simulations of Inner Protoplanetary Disks: Temperature Structures, Asymmetric Winds, and Episodic Surface Accretion

 - **Abstract**
 We perform two-dimensional global magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations including the full nonideal MHD effects (Ohmic diffusion, Hall effect, and ambipolar diffusion) and approximate radiation transport to understand the dynamics and thermal structure of the inner protoplanetary disks (PPDs). We have developed a simple radiative transfer model for PPDs that reasonably treats stellar non-thermal (XUV), stellar thermal (optical/infrared), and re-emitted radiations, reproducing the temperature structures from Monte Carlo radiative transfer. Our simulations show fast one-sided surface accretion ($\sim 10\%$ of Keplerian velocity) and asymmetric disk winds when the vertical magnetic field is aligned with the disk angular momentum. The asymmetry is due to the failure of the wind on the side with the accretion layer. On the accreting surface, clumps are repeatedly generated and accrete, driven by radiative feedback. For the anti-aligned fields, surface accretion becomes more moderate and time-variable, while the winds remain largely symmetric. For the thermal structure, accretion heating does not affect the disk temperature in any of our runs. This is because (1) the accretion energy dissipates via Joule heating at 2--3 gas scale heights, where low optical depth enables efficient radiative cooling, and (2) the winds remove $\gtrsim 10\%$ of the accretion energy. In contrast, the winds enhance radiative heating by elevating the irradiation front. These results highlight the importance of coupling between gas dynamics and radiation transport in PPDs, and provide observable magnetic activities such as fast episodic accretion, wind asymmetry, and molecular survival in XUV-irradiated winds.
#### Prospects of a New $L_5$ Trojan Flyby Target for the Lucy Mission

 - **Abstract**
 NASA's Lucy spacecraft is en route to conduct the first close encounter with Jupiter's Trojans. While most scheduled flybys lie in the $L_4$ cloud, the only $L_5$ target is the Patroclus-Menoetius binary. Since each flyby offers unique insights into target and population properties unattainable from Earth, we examine the feasibility of including an additional, yet unknown, $L_5$ target while minimizing the impact on Lucy's primary mission. We use the background $L_5$ Trojans brighter than the completeness limit to model their absolute magnitude, spatial, and orbital distributions. A semi-analytical approach estimates the number of Trojans accessible to Lucy for a given $\Delta v$ budget in both pre- and post-Patroclus scenarios. Our results indicate that, while it is unlikely that any suitable Trojan lies on Lucy's nominal path, a moderate $\Delta v$ investment ($35-50\,\mathrm{m/s}$) could enable a sub-kilometer ($500-700\,\mathrm{m}$) flyby prior to the Patroclus encounter. Post-Patroclus, the likelihood of a similar flyby is $\sim60\%$ for $\Delta v\sim$ 50 m/s. Simulations with synthetic Trojans reveal that potential targets cluster near the node opposite to the encounter window, producing an optimal search period in late 2026 for both scenarios. Surveying the densest $10\%$ of this region would require under 5 nights with Subaru/HSC or under 2 nights with Rubin, using shift-and-stack techniques. A successful sub-kilometric flyby would expand Lucy's Trojan target size range and provide new constraints on collisional evolution and the long-standing asymmetry in the $L_4/L_5$ clouds. This nodal-clustering strategy could guide target searches in future Lucy extensions or other planetary flyby missions.
#### On the Efficiency of Producing Gamma-Ray Bursts from Isolated Population III Stars

 - **Abstract**
 The rate of long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) from isolated Pop III stars is not well known, as it depends on our poor understanding of their initial mass function (IMF), rotation rates, stellar evolution, and mass loss. A sub-population of massive ($M_{\rm ZAMS}\gtrsim20M_\odot$) Pop III stars is expected to suffer core-collapse and launch a relativistic jet that would power a GRB. In the collapsar scenario, a key requirement is that the pre-supernova star imparts sufficient angular momentum to the remnant black hole to form an accretion disc and launch a relativistic jet, which demands rapid initial rotation of the progenitor star and suppression of line-driven mass loss during its chemically homogeneous evolution. Here we explore a grid of stellar evolution models of Pop III stars with masses $20\leq M_{\rm ZAMS}/M_\odot \leq 100$, which are initially rotating with surface angular velocities $0.6\leq \Omega_0/\Omega_{\rm crit}\leq 0.9$, where centrifugally-driven mass loss ensues for $\Omega>\Omega_{\rm crit}$. Realistic accretion and jet propagation models are used to derive the initial black hole masses and spins, and jet breakout times for these stars. The GRB production efficiency is obtained over a phase space comprising progenitor initial mass, rotation, and wind efficiency. For modest wind efficiency of $\eta_{\rm wind}=0.45-0.35$, the Pop III GRB production efficiency is $\eta_{\rm GRB}\sim10^{-5}-3\times10^{-4}\,M_\odot^{-1}$, respectively, for a top-heavy IMF. This yields an observable all-sky equivalent rate of $\sim2-40\,{\rm yr}^{-1}$ by \textit{Swift}, with 75\% of the GRBs located at $z\lesssim8$. If the actual observed rate is much lower, then this would imply $\eta_{\rm wind}>0.45$, which leads to significant loss of mass and angular momentum that renders isolated Pop III stars incapable of producing GRBs and favours a binary scenario instead.

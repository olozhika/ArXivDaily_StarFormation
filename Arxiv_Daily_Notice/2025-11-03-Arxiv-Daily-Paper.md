#### Evolved stars with inconsistent age estimates: Abundance outliers or mass transfer products?

 - **Abstract**
 In the Milky Way disk there is a strong trend linking stellar age to surface element abundances. Here we explore this relationship with a dataset of 8,803 red-giant and red-clump stars with both asteroseismic data from NASA Kepler Mission and surface abundances from the SDSS-V MWM. We find, with a k-nearest-neighbors approach, that the [Mg/H] and [Fe/Mg] abundance ratios predict asteroseismic ages to an accuracy of about 2 Gyr for the majority of stars. That said, there are substantial outlier stars whose surface abundances do not match their asteroseismic ages. Because asteroseismic ages for these stars are fundamentally based on density or mass, these outliers are mass-transfer candidates. Stars whose surface abundances predict a younger age (higher mass) than what's seen in the asteroseismology are mass accretor candidates (MAC); stars whose abundances predict an older age (lower mass) than the asteroseismology age are mass donor candidates (MDC). We create precise control samples, matched according to (1) surface abundances and (2) asteroseismic ages, for both the MAC and MDC stars; we use these to find slight differences in rotational velocity, [C/N], and [Na/Mg] between the mass-transfer candidates and their abundance neighbors. We find no drastic differences in kinematics, orbital invariants, UV excess, or other stellar abundances between outliers and their abundance neighbors. We deliver 377 mass-transfer candidates for follow-up observations. This project implicitly suggests a fundamental limit on the reliability of asteroseismic ages, and supports existing evidence that age-abundance outliers are products of binary mass transfer.
#### A Critical Examination of the PAH Hypothesis

 - **Abstract**
 The polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) hypothesis proposes that the aromatic infrared bands (AIBs) observed at 3.3, 6.2, 7.7, 8.6, 11.3, and 12.7 mic originate from gas-phase PAH molecules. These bands exhibit consistent peak wavelengths and profiles in diverse sources, and ISO SWS and JWST spectra show a nearly identical red wing of the 3.3 mic AIB and blue wing of the 11.2 mic AIB in the dominant Class A sources. This spectral uniformity suggests that the AIBs arise from a small, well-defined set of gas phase PAH species, regardless of the excitation conditions or the nature of the source such as HII regions, reflection nebulae, planetary nebula, young stellar objects, or the diffuse interstellar medium. However, a small number of gas phase PAH species is inconsistent with current modeling of the AIBs that require a wide range of PAH types and sizes. It is also inconsistent with the lack of observed UV and optical absorption bands from gas phase PAH molecules. Furthermore, there is no plausible formation pathway to produce only a small number of specific PAH molecules in the interstellar medium. These issues require quantitative investigation in order to definitively establish gas-phase PAH molecules as the carrier of the AIBs.

 - **Abstract**
 Nanophase metallic iron ( $\mathrm{npFe}^0$ ) is a key indicator of space weathering on the lunar surface, primarily attributed to solar wind irradiation and micrometeoroid impacts. Recent discoveries of hematite ( $\mathrm{Fe}_2 \mathrm{O}_3$ ), a highly oxidized form of iron, in the lunar polar regions challenge the prevailing understanding of the Moon's reducing environment. This study, using ReaxFF molecular dynamics simulations of micrometeoroid impacts on fayalite ( $\mathrm{Fe}_2 \mathrm{SiO}_4$ ), investigates the atomistic mechanisms leading to both reduced and oxidized iron species. Our simulations reveals that the high-temperature and pressure conditions at the impact crater surface produces a reduced iron environment while providing a transient oxygen-rich environment in the expanding plume. Our findings bridge previously disparate observations-linking impact-driven $\mathrm{npFe}^0$ formation to the puzzling presence of oxidized iron phases on the Moon, completing the observed strong dichotomous distribution of hematite between the nearside and farside of the Moon. These findings highlight that micrometeoroid impacts, by simultaneously generating spatially distinct redox environments, provide a formation mechanism that reconciles the ubiquitous identification of nanophase metallic iron ( $\mathrm{npFe}^0$ ) in returned lunar samples with $\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}$ signatures detected by remote sensing. This underscores the dynamic nature of space weathering processes. For a more nuanced understanding of regolith evolution, we should also consider the presence of different generations or types of $\mathrm{npFe}{ }^0$, such as those formed from solar wind reduction versus impact disproportionation.

 - **Abstract**
 Objective: ServiMon is designed to offer a scalable and intelligent pipeline for data collection and auditing to monitor distributed astronomical systems such as the ASTRI Mini-Array. The system enhances quality control, predictive maintenance, and real-time anomaly detection for telescope operations. Methods: ServiMon integrates cloud-native technologies-including Prometheus, Grafana, Cassandra, Kafka, and InfluxDB-for telemetry collection and processing. It employs machine learning algorithms, notably Isolation Forest, to detect anomalies in Cassandra performance metrics. Key indicators such as read/write latency, throughput, and memory usage are continuously monitored, stored as time-series data, and preprocessed for feature engineering. Anomalies detected by the model are logged in InfluxDB v2 and accessed via Flux for real-time monitoring and visualization. Results: AI-based anomaly detection increases system resilience by identifying performance degradation at an early stage, minimizing downtime, and optimizing telescope operations. Additionally, ServiMon supports astrostatistical analysis by correlating telemetry with observational data, thus enhancing scientific data quality. AI-generated alerts also improve real-time monitoring, enabling proactive system management. Conclusion: ServiMon's scalable framework proves effective for predictive maintenance and real-time monitoring of astronomical infrastructures. By leveraging cloud and edge computing, it is adaptable to future large-scale experiments, optimizing both performance and cost. The combination of machine learning and big data analytics makes ServiMon a robust and flexible solution for modern and next-generation observational astronomy.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the evolution of red supergiant (RSG) progenitors of core-collapse (CC) supernovae (SNe) with initial masses between $12-20~M_\odot$ focusing on the effects of enhanced mass loss due to pulsation-driven instabilities in their envelopes and subsequent dynamical ejections during advanced stages of nuclear burning. Using time-dependent mass loss from detailed MESA stellar evolution models, including a parameterized prescription for pulsation-driven superwinds and time-averaged mass loss rates attributed to resulting shock-induced ejections, we construct the circumstellar medium (CSM) before the SN explosion. We calculate resulting CSM density profiles and column densities considering the acceleration of the stellar wind. Our models produce episodes of enhanced mass loss $10^{-4}-10^{-2}~M_\odot~\rm{yr}^{-1}$ in the last centuries-decades before explosion forming dense CSM ($>10^{-15}~\rm{gcm}^{-3}$ at distances $<10^{15}$ cm) -- consistent with those inferred from multi-wavelength observations of Type II SNe such as SN~2023ixf and SN~2020ywx.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the polarization patterns from the moonlit sky as observed from the European Southern Observatory at Cerro Paranal. The moonlit sky background can be significant in astronomical observations and thus be a source of contamination in polarimetric studies. Based on sky observations during full Moon with FORS2 in imaging polarimetric mode, we measure the polarization degree and intensity at different wavelengths and scattering angles from the Moon, and compare them to theoretical and phenomenological single and multiple scattering models. Single scattering Rayleigh models are able to reproduce the wavelength dependence of the polarization as long as strong depolarization factors that increase with wavelength are introduced. Intensity data, however, require the inclusion of single Mie scattering from larger aerosol particles. The best models that simultaneously fit polarization and intensity data, are a combination of both single scattering processes, Rayleigh and Mie, plus an unpolarized multiple scattering component. Both Mie and multiple scattering become more dominant at longer wavelengths. Other factors like cloud depolarization and the sunlight contribution during the twilight were also investigated. The present study underscores the importance of accounting for moonlight scattering to enhance the accuracy of polarimetric observations of astronomical targets.

 - **Abstract**
 In many areas of astronomy, spectra of different objects are co-added or stacked to improve signal-to-noise and reveal population-level characteristics. As the number of exoplanets with measured transmission spectra grows, it becomes important to understand when stacking spectra from different exoplanets is appropriate and what stacked spectra represent physically. Stacking will be particularly valuable for long-period planets, where repeated observations of the same planet are time-consuming. Here, we show that stacked exoplanet transmission spectra are approximately mathematically equivalent to spectra generated from the geometric mean of each planet's abundance ratios. We test this by comparing stacked and geometric mean spectra across grids of forward models over JWST's NIRSpec/G395H wavelength range (2.8-5.2$\mu$m). For two dominant species (e.g., H$_2$O and CO$_2$), the geometric mean accurately reflects the stacked spectrum if abundance ratios are self-similar across planets. Introducing a third species (e.g., CH$_4$) makes temperature a critical factor, with stacking becoming inappropriate across the CO/CH$_4$ boundary. Surface gravity exerts only a minor influence when stacking within comparable planetary regimes. We further assess the number of stacked, distinct sub-Neptunes with high-metallicity atmospheres and low-pressure cloud decks required to rule out a flat spectrum at $>5\sigma$, as a function of both cloud deck pressure and per-planet spectral precision. These results provide guidance on when stacking is useful and on how to interpret stacked exoplanet spectra in the era of population studies of exoplanets.

 - **Abstract**
 Cyclopentadiene (c-C5H6) is considered a key molecule in the formation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the interstellar medium (ISM). The synthesis of PAHs from simpler precursors is known as the "bottom-up" theory, which, so far, has been dominated by reactions between organic radicals. However, this mechanism struggles to account for the origin of the smallest cycles themselves. Ion-molecule reactions emerge as promising alternative pathways to explain the formation of these molecules. In the present work, we investigate the reaction network of the main ionic precursor of cyclopentadiene c-C5H7+ . To this end, we establish an integrated protocol that combines astrochemical modelling to identify viable formation routes under cold interstellar medium conditions, automated reaction path search and kinetic simulations to obtain accurate descriptions of the reaction pathways and reliable rate constants. In particular, we examine the reaction between ethylene (C2H4) and the linear propargyl cation (CH2CCH+). Our results reveal that the formation of c-C5H7+ by radiative association turns out to be inefficient, contrary to our initial expectations. Instead, the system predominantly evolves through bimolecular channels yielding c-C5H5+ and CH3CCH2+ with the formation of c-C5H5+ offering new insights into reactivity that supports molecular growth in the ISM.
#### Multi-band infrared imaging reveals dusty spiral arcs around the binary B[e] star 3 Puppis

 - **Abstract**
 3 Puppis is the brightest known B[e] star. Recent work classifies this A-type object as a supergiant, yet the impact of its binarity on the circumstellar environment (CE) remains hard to characterize. To resolve its dusty region at 5-10 mas, we obtained mid-IR interferometric observations with VLTI/MATISSE over 3-12 {\mu}m. Because the (u,v) coverage supports imaging, we introduce a statistical interferometric-imaging workflow based on MiRA to generate averaged images: this systematic approach enables the selection of an optimal set of reconstructions, improving the robustness and fidelity of the recovered features. We also use SPARCO, an independent tool well suited to bright central objects embedded in fainter extended emission. Images from both tools in the L, M, and N bands agree and reveal an asymmetric, elongated feature ~17 mas (~10 au at 631 pc) southeast of the star with ~20% density contrast. A second northwest asymmetry and a skewed inner rim are detected. Simple geometric modelling, guided by the MATISSE images, constrains the morphology, location, and flux of the CE and its asymmetries. The images are consistent with earlier VLTI measurements but expose a more complex CE with large-scale clumps in the southeast and northwest parts of the disc. Hydrodynamic modelling indicates that tidal spiral-wake perturbations from the central binary, dynamically excited at Lindblad resonances in the circumbinary disc, best explain the radial extent and curvature of the elongated structures seen in all bands.
#### SN 2024cld: unveiling the complex mass-loss histories of evolved supergiant progenitors to core collapse supernovae

 - **Abstract**
 Pre-explosion mass loss in supernova (SN) progenitors is a crucial unknown factor in stellar evolution, yet has been illuminated recently by the diverse zoo of interacting transients. We present SN2024cld, a transitional core-collapse SN at a distance of 39 Mpc, straddling the boundary between SN II and SN IIn, showing persistent interaction with circumstellar material (CSM) similar to H-rich SN1998S and PTF11iqb. The SN was discovered and classified just 12h post-explosion via the GOTO-FAST high-cadence program. Optical spectroscopy, photometry, and polarimetry over 220d chart the complex, long-lived interaction in this transient. Early evolution is dominated by CSM interaction, showing a 14d rise to a peak absolute magnitude of g=-17.6 mag, with clear flash-ionisation signatures. SN2024cld also shows a marked double-plateau light curve powered by CSM interaction, with high-velocity (6000 km/s) shoulders on a strong multi-component H-alpha profile. Dense polarimetric coverage reveals marked evolution in the photospheric geometry -- peaking at p=2% 10 days post-explosion, and rotating approx. 60 deg as the ejecta sweep more distant CSM. We observe a narrow 60 km/s H-alpha P Cygni feature throughout, associated with pre-shock CSM. SN2024cld represents among the best-observed 98S-like SNe to date, revealing a multi-component CSM structure: a dense, inner aspherical envelope, CSM disk/torus, and tenuous, extended wind. We propose this SN arose from an evolved supergiant progenitor experiencing multiple mass loss episodes in its terminal years, with binary interaction plausibly generating the CSM disk. SN2024cld constrains the progenitors and mass-loss paradigms of 98S-like SNe, unveiling the chaotic ends of evolved supergiant stars from afar.

 - **Abstract**
 We recently released 10 years of HARPS-N solar telescope and the goal of this manuscript is to present the different optimisations made to the data reduction, to describe data curation, and to perform some analyses that demonstrate the extreme RV precision of those data. By analysing all the HARPS-N wavelength solutions over 13 years, we bring to light instrumental systematics at the 1 m/s level. After correction, we demonstrate a peak-to-peak precision on the HARPS-N wavelength solution better than 0.75 m/s over 13 years. We then carefully curate the decade of HARPS-N re-reduced solar observations by rejecting 30% of the data affected either by clouds, bad atmospheric conditions or well-understood instrumental systematics. Finally, we correct the curated data for spurious sub-m/s RV effects caused by erroneous instrumental drift measurements and by changes in the spectral blaze function over time. After curation and correction, a total of 109,466 HARPS-N solar spectra and respective RVs over a decade are available. The median photon-noise precision of the RV data is 0.28 m/s and, on daily timescales, the median RV rms is 0.49 m/s, similar to the level imposed by stellar granulation signals. On 10-year timescales, the large RV rms of 2.95 m/s results from the RV signature of the Sun's magnetic cycle. When modelling this long-term effect using the Magnesium II activity index, we demonstrate a long-term RV precision of 0.41 m/s. We also analysed contemporaneous HARPS-N and NEID solar RVs and found the data from both instruments to be of similar quality and precision, with an overall RV differece rms of 0.79 m/s. This decade of high-cadence HARPS-N solar observations with short- and long-term precision below 1 m/s represents a crucial dataset to further understand stellar activity signals in solar-type stars , and to advance other science cases requiring such an extreme precision.

 - **Abstract**
 The cosmological principle, asserting large-scale homogeneity and isotropy, underpins the standard model of cosmology. Testing its validity using independent astronomical probes remains crucial for understanding the global structure of the Universe. We investigate the angular distribution of Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) using two of the most comprehensive all-sky datasets available, the BATSE (CGRO) and Fermi GBM catalog to test the isotropy of the GRB sky at large angular scales. We perform spherical harmonic decomposition of the GRB sky maps and estimate the dipole and quadrupole amplitudes. Statistical significance is evaluated by comparing the observed multipole amplitudes against distributions derived from 500 Monte Carlo realizations of isotropic skies. Our results show that the observed dipole amplitudes for both BATSE and Fermi GBM datasets lie within $1\sigma$ region of their respective null distributions. However, the quadrupole amplitude in the raw BATSE and Fermi skies appears elevated at $3.7\sigma$ and $3\sigma$ respectively. After incorporating the BATSE sky exposure function, this apparent quadrupole anisotropy vanishes, indicating that instrumental non-uniformities fully account for the signal. Our method's reliability is validated through controlled simulations, which show it can detect the injected dipoles in BATSE-sized isotropic skies. These findings reinforce the statistical isotropy of the GRB sky and underscore the importance of accurate exposure corrections in cosmological anisotropy analyses.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding the diurnal behavior of lee wave clouds on Mars provides critical insight into the planet's mesoscale atmospheric dynamics and their interaction with surface topography. Lee wave clouds exhibit distinct spatial and temporal patterns that vary over the Martian day. In this study, we investigate the diurnal distribution and frequency of lee wave cloud activity during Martian Year (MY) 36 using observations from the EXI instrument aboard the Emirates Mars Mission (EMM) "Hope" spacecraft. A total of 50 lee wave events were identified, with a pronounced peak in activity during afternoon hours between solar longitudes (Ls) 270 deg and 360 deg. Our analysis reveals a seasonal and local-time dependence for these clouds, providing a comparative framework with previous mission datasets. These findings not only enhance the current understanding of Martian weather processes but also support future efforts to model and predict terrain-induced cloud dynamics across key locations on Mars.

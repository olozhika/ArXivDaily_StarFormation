 - **Abstract**
 The magnetic field is known to play a crucial role in star formation. Dust polarization is an effective tool for probing the morphology of the field, yet it does not directly trace its strength. Several methods have been developed, combining polarization and spectroscopic data, to estimate the strength of the magnetic field, including the DCF method, which relates these quantities to the magnetic-field strength under the assumption of Alfvénic turbulence. Skalidis & Tassis (2021) (ST), relaxed this assumption to account for the compressible modes, deriving more accurate estimates of the field strength. We evaluate the accuracy of these methods in star-forming regions and propose a systematic approach for calculating the key observational parameters involved: the velocity dispersion (dv), the dispersion of polarization angles (d\theta), and the cloud density (rho). We use a 3D MHD chemodynamical simulation of a turbulent molecular cloud and generate synthetic observations, for seven different inclination angles. We employ various approaches for estimating the parameters dv, d\theta, and rho and find that the approach used to calculate these parameters plays a crucial role in estimating the magnetic field strength. We show that the value probed by both the DCF and ST methods corresponds to the median of the molecular-species-weighted POS component of the magnetic field. The ST outperforms DCF, accurately following the expected cosine trend with respect to the inclination angle, and remains within 1\sigma from the true strength of the field. Based on our analysis, we proposed that, in self-gravitating clouds, the intrinsic parameters (rho, dv, d\theta) should be calculated as follows: rho using radiative transfer analysis, dv using the second moment maps, and d\theta by fitting Gaussians to the polarization angle distributions to remove the contribution of the hourglass morphology.
#### Bouncing Grains Keep Protoplanetary Disks Bright

 - **Abstract**
 Proto-planetary disks display the so-called size-luminosity relation, where their mm-wavelength fluxes scale linearly with their emitting areas. This suggests that these disks are optically thick in mm-band, an interpretation further supported by their near-black-body spectral indexes. Such characteristics are seen not only among disks in very young star-forming regions like Lupus (1-3 Myrs), but, as we demonstrate here, also among disks in the much older Upper Scorpius region (5-11 Myrs). How can disks shine brightly for so long, when grain growth and subsequent radial drift should have quickly depleted their solid reservoir? Here, we suggest that the "bouncing barrier" provides the answer. Even colliding at very low speeds (below 1cm/s), grains already fail to stick to each other but instead bounce off in-elastically. This barrier stalls grain growth at a near-universal size of $\sim 100 \mu m$. These small grains experience much reduced radial drift, and so are able to keep the disks bright for millions of years. They are also tightly coupled to gas, offering poor prospects for processes like streaming instability or pebble accretion. We speculate briefly on how planetesimals can arise in such a bath of 100-micron grains.
#### Growing the Intermediate-mass Black Hole in Omega Centauri

 - **Abstract**
 The recent detection of fast-moving stars in the core of Omega Centauri ($\omega$ Cen), the most massive globular cluster (GC) in the Milky Way, has provided strong evidence for the presence of an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH). As $\omega$ Cen, is likely the accreted nucleus of a dwarf galaxy, this IMBH also represents a unique opportunity to study BH seeding mechanisms and their potential role in the formation of supermassive BHs. We present Monte Carlo $N$-body models of $\omega$ Cen with detailed treatments for the loss cone dynamics involving stars, binaries, and compact objects. Starting with BH seeds of $500-5000 \, M_{\odot}$ (consistent with runaway collisions of massive stars), our cluster models grow IMBHs with masses of $\sim50{,}000 \, M_{\odot}$ after 12 Gyr, while successfully reproducing the present-day surface brightness and velocity dispersion profiles of $\omega$ Cen. We find a population of fast stars similar to those observed in the core of $\omega$ Cen, with the fastest stars originating from binaries that were tidally disrupted by the IMBH. The IMBH growth is primarily driven by mergers with $30-40 \, M_{\odot}$ BHs, suggesting a present-day IMBH-BH merger rate of $\sim(4-8)\times10^{-8}~\rm{yr}^{-1}$ in $\omega$ Cen-like GCs. Our models also predict a similar rate of tidal disruption events ($\sim5\times10^{-8}~\rm{yr}^{-1}$) which, depending on the frequency of $\omega$ Cen-like GCs per galaxy, may represent anywhere from $0.1\%$ to $10\%$ of the observed TDE rate.
#### Parsec-scale SiO emission in the Galactic Center

 - **Abstract**
 The central 5 parsecs of our Galactic Center is rich in various molecular tracers. The region is observed to be hot, highly ionized, and volatile, resulting in complex chemistry and kinematics. Countless molecular observations of the central region orbiting the central super-massive black hole Sgr A* have revealed a stable grouping of clouds with a disk-like structure known as the circumnuclear disk (CND) orbiting Sgr A* between 1.5 and 3 pc. The CND houses the densest population of gas outside the ionized streams in the minispiral falling onto Sgr A*. However, the small-scale kinematics of the clouds and gas are poorly understood in this region. In this paper, we report single dish SiO (1-0) observations of the central 5 pc surrounding Sgr A* taken with the Green Bank Telescope. Most of the SiO (1-0) traces the southern streamer and Sgr A East-neither of which are associated with the CND. However, one region in the CND, known as the NE Arm, shows high-intensity SiO emission unlike in the rest of the CND, indicating the NE Arm as a candidate region of either cloud-cloud collision or early star formation. Further high resolution observations of the region are needed to distinguish between the two scenarios.
#### Supernovae from stellar mergers and accretors of binary mass transfer: Implications for Type IIP, 1987A-like and interacting supernovae

 - **Abstract**
 As most massive stars are born in binary and other multiple-star systems, many are expected to exchange mass with a companion star or merge with it during their lives. This means that most supernovae (SNe) are from such binary products. Here, we focus on hydrogen-rich Type II SNe from accretors of binary mass transfer and stellar mergers. We compute various SN properties such as the explosion energies, nickel yields, and neutron star (NS) kick velocities, but also consider NS masses. We find tight correlations between these parameters and, e.g., the central specific entropy and core compactness. However, there is no obvious relation between these explosion properties and the evolutionary history of the pre-SN stars. We find linear relations between the nickel mass and the SN explosion energy and the NS remnant mass. We further group our models into progenitors of SNe IIP, SN 1987A-like and interacting SNe, predict their SN and SN-progenitor properties and compare to observations. Accretors of binary mass transfer and stellar mergers naturally produce SNe IIP with long plateau durations from progenitors with relatively small CO-cores but large envelope masses (c.f. SN 2015ba). Our models give rise to tight relations between the plateau luminosity and the nickel mass as well as the SN ejecta velocity as inferred observationally for SNe IIP. We speculate that cool/red supergiants at $\log\,L/L_\odot\,{\geq}\,5.5$ encounter enhanced mass loss due to envelope instabilities and could then explode in interacting SNe IIn. The rate of such SNe from our models seems compatible with observations. Some of our binary models explode as $10^6\,L_\odot$ blue supergiants that may have encountered enhanced and/or eruptive mass loss shortly before their SNe and could thus help understand interacting SNe such as SN 1961V and SN 2005gl but also superluminous Type II SNe such as SN 2010jl.

 - **Abstract**
 The detection of transient phenomena such as Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs), Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs), stellar flares, novae, and supernovae, alongside novel cosmic messengers like high-energy neutrinos and gravitational waves, has transformed astrophysics in recent years. Maximizing the discovery potential of multi-messenger and multi-wavelength follow-up observations, as well as serendipitous detections, requires a tool that rapidly compiles and contextualizes relevant information for each new event. We present Astro-COLIBRI, an advanced platform designed to meet this challenge. Astro-COLIBRI integrates a public RESTful API, real-time databases, a cloud-based alert system, and user-friendly clients (a website and mobile apps for iOS and Android). It processes astronomical alerts from multiple streams in real time, filtering them based on user-defined criteria and placing them in their multi-wavelength and multi-messenger context. The platform offers intuitive data visualization, a quick summary of relevant event properties, and an assessment of observing conditions at numerous observatories worldwide. We here describe its architecture, data resources, and main functionalities. We highlight the automatic collection of photometric data from a variety of large scale optical surveys, a recently added feature that significantly improves the capabilities of the Astro-COLIBRI platform.

 - **Abstract**
 The radio emission of cosmic-ray air-showers changes significantly depending on parameters like signal frequency, magnetic field configuration and observing altitude. We use CoREAS simulations to adapt an existing signal model for the radio emission of inclined showers in the 30-80 MHz frequency band to the wide 50-200 MHz band. Our model uses a parametrisation of the charge excess fraction to isolate the geomagnetic emission component. We reconstruct the geomagnetic radiation energy by fitting a lateral distribution function, provided by the model, to the geomagnetic energy fluence distribution of the shower. After we correct for the shower geometry and air density, we correlate the radiation energy with the electromagnetic energy of the shower. We show that the method intrinsic energy resolutions < 5% for the sites of the Pierre Auger Observatory and GRANDProto300. For GRANDProto300, we test the reconstruction with simulations of a realistic, sparse antenna grid and with added noise, and find an energy resolution of < 10% with negligible bias. We do a similar study for a much larger array of 10, 000 km2 with 1 km antenna spacing. We find an intrinsic energy resolution of < 10%.
#### Influence of interstellar environment near the solar system on cosmic-ray spectra and dipole anisotropy

 - **Abstract**
 Properties of interstellar environment near the solar system have been probed by missions like IBEX, Voyager over the last two decades. Although it has been well recognized that properties of cosmic rays up to the PeV energy can be affected by the local interstellar environment, detailed modeling has not been done. We show that a three component model for the cosmic ray proton and helium spectra from GV to several PV can naturally explain the energy dependence of the dipole anisotropy of cosmic ray fluxes by considering effects of the local interstellar environment on cosmic ray transport, addressing the so-called cosmic ray anisotropy problem. In particular, it is shown that the dipole amplitude and position angle below $\sim 100$ TeV are very sensitive to the velocity of the heliosphere in the local interstellar cloud and the motion of the local interstellar cloud in the local standard of rest. Better measurement of cosmic ray flux anisotropy by experiments like LHAASO and properties of the local interstellar environment by future missions like IMAP will be able to test this model.

 - **Abstract**
 Core-collapse supernovae are of particular interest in multi-messenger astronomy due to their potential to accelerate cosmic rays and produce high-energy neutrinos. One such supernova is the recent SN2023ixf located in M101 (the Pinwheel Galaxy). It is the closest (6.4 Mpc) and brightest (B band magnitude 10.8) core-collapse supernova in nearly a decade. This supernova likely had a progenitor surrounded by dense circumstellar material which, during the supernova, may have produced neutrinos when ejecta collided with the material. I will present results of a follow-up of this supernova using data collected from the IceCube Neutrino Observatory located at the South Pole. We obtain results consistent with background expectations with time-integrated energy flux ($E^2 dN/dE$) upper limits of 0.35 GeV/cm$^2$ for a 32-day time window and 0.44 GeV/cm$^2$ for a 4-day time window, both at 90% confidence level for an $E^{-2}$ power law. These correspond to values of $2.7 \times 10^{48}$ erg for the 32-day time window and $3.5 \times 10^{48}$ erg for the 4-day time window at the supernova.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a comprehensive theoretical investigation of Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) and their manifestations in astrophysical and cosmological contexts. Building upon the foundations of quantum statistics in curved spacetime, we derive the conditions for BEC formation under extreme gravitational fields and explore their implications for compact objects and early universe physics. Through rigorous mathematical treatment incorporating general relativistic corrections to the Bose-Einstein distribution, we demonstrate that BEC phenomena may play crucial roles in neutron star interiors, primordial black hole formation, and dark matter halos. Our analysis reveals that the critical temperature for condensation exhibits non-trivial dependence on spacetime curvature, with corrections of order O(GM/rc2) becoming significant near compact objects. We further show that axion dark matter, if it exists, naturally forms a cosmic BEC with coherence length {\lambda}dB ~ 10^-3 pc for ma ~ 10^-22 eV, potentially explaining the observed core-cusp problem in galactic dark matter profiles. These findings suggest that quantum coherence effects at macroscopic scales may be more prevalent in the universe than previously recognized, with profound implications for our understanding of cosmic structure formation and the behaviour of matter under extreme conditions.
#### On the hypothesis of a bi-isotropic plasma permeating the interstellar space

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we study the propagation of electromagnetic waves in a magnetized chiral plasma that pervades the interstellar space. The Maxwell equations, supplemented by bi-isotropic constitutive relations, are rewritten to describe a cold, uniform, and collisionless plasma model that yields new collective electromagnetic modes for distinct pairs of refractive indices associated with right- and left-handed circularly polarized waves. We have investigated the optical behavior through the rotatory power (RP) and dichroism coefficient, reporting that the finite chiral parameter induces double RP sign reversal, an exotic optical signature that takes place in chiral dielectrics and rotating plasmas. In the low-frequency regime, a modified propagating helicon with right-handed circular polarization is obtained. Next, supposing that the interstellar medium behaves as a bi-isotropic cold plasma, we employ Astrophysical data of radio pulsars to achieve upper limits on the magnetoelectric parameters magnitude. In particular, by using dispersion measure and rotation measure data from five pulsars, we constrain the magnitude of the chiral parameter to the order of $10^{-16}$ and $10^{-22}$, respectively.
#### Spinning into the Gap: Direct-Horizon Collapse as the Origin of GW231123 from End-to-End GRMHD Simulations

 - **Abstract**
 GW231123, the most massive binary black hole (BH) merger observed to date, involves component BHs with masses inside the pair-instability mass gap and unusually high spins. This challenges standard formation channels such as classical stellar evolution and hierarchical mergers. However, stellar rotation and magnetic fields, which have not been systematically incorporated in prior models, can strongly influence the BH properties. We present the first self-consistent simulations tracking a massive, low-metallicity helium star from helium core burning through collapse, BH formation, and post-BH formation accretion using 3D general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations. Starting from a $250\,M_\odot$ helium core, we show that collapse above the pair-instability mass gap, aided by rotation and magnetic fields, drives mass loss through disk winds and jet launching. This enables the formation of highly spinning BHs within the mass gap and reveals a BH spin-mass correlation. Strong magnetic fields extract angular momentum from the BH through magnetically driven outflows, which in turn suppress accretion, resulting in slowly spinning BHs within the mass gap. In contrast, stars with weak fields permit nearly complete collapse and spin-up of the BH to $ a\approx1$. We show that massive low-metallicity stars with moderate magnetic fields naturally produce BHs whose masses and spins match those inferred for GW231123, and are also consistent with those of GW190521. The outflows may impart a BH kick, which can induce spin-orbit misalignment and widen the post-collapse orbit, delaying the merger. The outflows launched during collapse may power short-lived, high-luminosity jets comparable to the most energetic $\gamma$-ray bursts, offering a potential observational signature of such events in the early universe.
#### Massive extended streamers feed high-mass young stars

 - **Abstract**
 Stars are born in a variety of environments that determine how they gather gas to achieve their final masses. It is generally believed that disks are ubiquitous around protostars as a result of angular momentum conservation and are natural places to grow planets. As such, they are proposed to be the last link in the inflow chain from the molecular cloud to the star. However, disks are not the only form that inflows can take. Here we report on high-resolution observations performed with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array that reveal inflows in the form of streamers. These streamers persist well within the expected disk radius, indicating that they play a substitute role channeling material from the envelope directly to an unresolved small disk or even directly to the forming high-mass protostar. These flows are massive enough to feed the central unresolved region at a rate sufficient to quench the feedback effects of the young massive star.
#### CIGaRS I: Combined simulation-based inference from SNae Ia and host photometry

 - **Abstract**
 Using type Ia supernovae (SNae Ia) as cosmological probes requires empirical corrections, which correlate with their host environment. We present a unified Bayesian hierarchical model designed to infer, from purely photometric observations, the intrinsic dependence of SN Ia brightness on progenitor properties (metallicity & age), the delay-time distribution (DTD) that governs their rate as a function of age, and cosmology, as well as the redshifts of all hosts. The model incorporates physics-based prescriptions for star formation and chemical evolution from Prospector-beta, dust extinction of both galaxy and SN light, and observational selection effects. We show with simulations that intrinsic dependences on metallicity and age have distinct observational signatures, with metallicity mimicking the well-known step of SN Ia magnitudes across a host stellar mass of $\approx 10^{10} M_{\odot}$. We then demonstrate neural simulation-based inference of all model parameters from mock observations of ~16 000 SNae Ia and their hosts up to redshift 0.9. Our joint physics-based approach delivers robust and precise photometric redshifts (<0.01 median scatter) and improved cosmological constraints, unlocking the full power of photometric data and paving the way for an end-to-end simulation-based analysis pipeline in the LSST era.
#### Rotational Spectroscopy and Tentative Interstellar Detection of 3-Hydroxypropanal (HOCH$_2$CH$_2$CHO) in the G+0.693-0.027 Molecular Cloud

 - **Abstract**
 We synthesized the astrochemically relevant molecule 3-hydroxypropanal (HOCH$_2$CH$_2$CHO) and subsequently measured and analyzed its rotational spectrum in several frequency regions ranging from 130 to 485 GHz. We analyzed the ground vibrational state as well as the two perturbed lowest-lying vibrationally excited states. With the resulting rotational parameters, we searched for this molecule in the Sagittarius B2(N) and NGC 6334I hot cores, the IRAS 16293-2422B hot corino, and the G+0.693-0.027 and TMC-1 molecular clouds. Rotational emission of 3-hydroxypropanal was tentatively detected toward G+0.693-0.027 and a column density of (8.6$\pm$1.4)$\times$10$^{12}$ cm$^{-2}$ was determined. However, this molecule was not detected in the other sources that were investigated. The chemical implications of this tentative discovery are analyzed and several potential chemical formation pathways of this species are discussed.
#### Neural-Network Chemical Emulator for First-Star Formation: Robust Iterative Predictions over a Wide Density Range

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.16114

 - **Abstract**
 We present a neural-network emulator for the thermal and chemical evolution in Population~III star formation. The emulator accurately reproduces the thermochemical evolution over a wide density range spanning 21 orders of magnitude (10$^{-3}$-10$^{18}$ cm$^{-3}$), tracking six primordial species: H, H$_2$, e$^{-}$, H$^{+}$, H$^{-}$, and H$_2^{+}$. To handle the broad dynamic range, we partition the density range into five subregions and train separate deep operator networks (DeepONets) in each region. When applied to randomly sampled thermochemical states, the emulator achieves relative errors below 10% in over 90% of cases for both temperature and chemical abundances (except for the rare species H$_2^{+}$). The emulator is roughly ten times faster on a CPU and more than 1000 times faster for batched predictions on a GPU, compared with conventional numerical integration. Furthermore, to ensure robust predictions under many iterations, we introduce a novel timescale-based update method, where a short-timestep update of each variable is computed by rescaling the predicted change over a longer timestep equal to its characteristic variation timescale. In one-zone collapse calculations, the results from the timescale-based method agree well with traditional numerical integration even with many iterations at a timestep as short as 10$^{-4}$ of the free-fall time. This proof-of-concept study suggests the potential for neural network-based chemical emulators to accelerate hydrodynamic simulations of star formation.
#### Reheating study of Mexican-Hat-type Potentials

 - **Abstract**
 We study reheating in Mexican Hat type potentials, emphasizing the role of the post-inflationary equation-of-state parameter($\overline{\omega }_{\text{re}}$) in shaping observable predictions. By exploring the allowed range of $\overline{\omega }_{\text{re}}$, we derive reheating temperature, e-fold counts, and inflationary observables, showing that the conventional Mexican Hat model satisfies Planck18+BK18+BAO constraints on $n_s$ and r. The analysis underscores reheating as a critical link between theoretical potentials and CMB data. In addition, the holographic Mexican Hat realization is examined as a benchmark, with our results mapping its phenomenological boundaries. This work illustrates how reheating studies sharpen constraints and guide refinements of unified inflationary scenarios.
#### Exploring HI Galaxy Redshift Survey Strategies for the FAST Core Array Interferometry

 - **Abstract**
 We explore the feasibility of HI galaxy redshift surveys with the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope (FAST) and its proposed Core Array interferometry. Using semi-analytical simulations, we compare the performance of the FAST single-dish and Core Array modes in drift scan (DS) and on-the-fly (OTF) observations across different redshifts. Our results show that the FAST single-dish mode enables significant HI detections at low redshifts ($z \lesssim 0.35$) but is limited at higher redshifts due to shot noise. The Core Array interferometry, with higher sensitivity and angular resolution, provides robust HI galaxy detections up to $z \sim 1$, maintaining a sufficient number density for power spectrum measurements and BAO constraints. At low redshifts ($z \sim 0.01$ -- $0.08$), both configurations perform well, though cosmic variance dominates uncertainties. At higher redshifts ($z > 0.35$), the Core Array outperforms the single-dish mode, while increasing the survey area has little impact on single-dish observations due to shot noise limitations. The DS mode efficiently covers large sky areas but is constrained by Earth's rotation, whereas the OTF mode allows more flexible deep-field surveys at the cost of operational overhead. Our findings highlight the importance of optimizing survey strategies to maximize FAST's potential for HI cosmology. The Core Array is particularly well-suited for high-redshift HI galaxy surveys, enabling precise constraints on large-scale structure and dark energy.

 - **Abstract**
 At ultra-high energies, the flux of cosmic rays is too low for direct measurements to be meaningful. When a cosmic ray enters the atmosphere, it initiates an extensive air shower, producing a cascade of secondary particles that propagate toward the ground. Large arrays of surface detectors are used to measure these secondary particles upon arrival. The signal detected at a specific reference distance from the shower core serves as a proxy for the shower size and, consequently, as a reliable estimator of the energy of primary cosmic ray. However, shower development is influenced by attenuation effects: measured signals at the ground depend on the amount of traversed atmospheric density (column density) through which the shower evolves. Since the column density varies with the inclination of the shower, it is important to account for these attenuation effects to ensure accurate energy estimation. In this study, we derive physics-and-geometry-based functional forms to describe attenuation and propose appropriate expansion terms using simple one-dimensional shower-development models, incorporating one or two main particle-cascade components. We then evaluate the applicability and effectiveness of these functional forms using a Monte-Carlo dataset that includes various primary cosmic-ray particles. By directly calibrating the the shower size derived from ground signals to the Monte-Carlo energy, we characterize attenuation behavior across different primary particles, assess the energy dependence of attenuation, and quantify systematic uncertainties introduced by different functional forms.
#### Terrestrial Exoplanet Internal Structure Constraints Enabled by Comprehensive Host Star Characterization Reveal that Terrestrial Planets in Mean-motion Resonances are Water Rich

 - **Abstract**
 Exoplanet mass and radius inferences fundamentally rely on host star mass and radius inferences. Despite the importance of host star mass, radius, and elemental abundance inferences for the derivation of exoplanet internal structure constraints, published constraints have often been based on inferences that are not self-consistent. For 24 dwarf stars hosting terrestrial exoplanets, we use astrometric and photometric data plus high-resolution spectroscopy to infer accurate, precise, homogeneous, and physically self-consistent photospheric and fundamental stellar parameters as well as elemental abundances. We infer updated planetary masses and radii using these data plus Doppler and transit observables, then use the complete data set to derive constraints on the core-mass fractions of these terrestrial exoplanets. We find that the population of resonant or likely formerly resonant terrestrial exoplanets represented by Kepler-36 b and Kepler-105 c has a significantly lower mean core-mass fraction than the rest of the terrestrial exoplanets in our sample. Their resonant configurations suggest that they migrated inwards from more distant formation locations, and we attribute their low densities to the incorporation and retention of significant amounts of water during their formation. We confirm that the ultra-short-period exoplanets 55 Cnc e and WASP-47 e have densities inconsistent with pure-rock compositions. We propose that they are both the stripped cores of mini-Neptunes and associate their low densities with the presence of significant amounts of hydrogen, helium, water, and/or other volatiles in their interiors. We verify that our results are independent of stellar parameter and elemental abundance inference approach and therefore robust.

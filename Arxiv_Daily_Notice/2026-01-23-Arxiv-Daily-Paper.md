 - **Abstract**
 We study the kinematics of condensations in 30 fields forming high-mass stars with ALMA at a high-resolution of ~0.08'' on average (~230 au). The presence of disks is important for feeding high-mass stars without feedback halting growth as their masses increase. In the search for velocity gradients resembling rotation that can reveal the presence of disks, we analyze the emission of gas tracers in 49 objects using CH$_3$OH, CH$_3$CN, and tentative detections of HNCO and cis-HCOOH. Most of the velocity distributions show velocity gradients indicative of rotation. We reveal a total of 32 disk candidates, the largest sample to date that has been uniformly analyzed at a few hundred au scales in the high-mass regime. Their position-velocity maps are generally asymmetric with one side brighter than the opposite. We successfully fit a power law to the position-velocity maps of the disk candidates and find indices between -0.5 (Keplerian rotation) and -1 (rotation under specific angular momentum conservation) with a median of -0.7. Under Keplerian rotation assumption, we estimate central masses, uncorrected for inclination, ranging between 7 to 45 M$_\odot$. Excluding outliers, the disk candidates are relatively more compact (<200 au) and less massive (<5 M$_\odot$) than previous results at coarser angular resolution. We calculate an average Toomre-$Q$ parameter and find that most are gravitationally unstable (median of 0.5). We conclude that these observations offer the first opportunity to separate the disk and envelope components of hot cores on a statistically significant sample, and confirm that anisotropic collapse plays an role in feeding high-mass (proto)stars.

 - **Abstract**
 Establishing ages for young clusters is key for properly tracking the star formation history of a region. In this paper we investigate a new approach to estimating ages for young populations, based on the well-founded assumption that the initial mass function is the same throughout a star forming cloud. We trial this method for six young clusters in the Perseus star forming region. For all six clusters, we construct new member samples in a homogeneous way using Gaia DR3. We estimate masses by comparing 2MASS photometry to theoretical isochrones, including Monte Carlo simulations to propagate the errors. We compare the mass distributions of the clusters for a range of plausible ages, looking for a combination of ages that results in indistinguishable mass distributions across the region. We find the best fit for ages of 1 Myr for NGC1333+Autochthe, 2 Myr for IC348, 2-3 Myr for Heleus, 3-4 Myr for Mestor, 4-5 Myr for Electryon+Cynurus, and 5-8 Myr for Alcaeus. All other combinations of ages are ruled out by this criterion. The established age sequence is consistent with the relative ages inferred from disc fractions, and broadly aligns with the age sequence determined in previous studies using isochrone fitting. We suggest that this approach can be a useful complement and cross-check to established methods to estimate ages in young populations.

 - **Abstract**
 Massive stars ($M>8\mathrm{M_\odot}$) emit neutrinos known as pre-supernova (pre-SN) neutrinos through thermal and nuclear interactions for cooling the stellar core during the final stage of stellar evolution. Real-time monitoring of their pre-SN neutrino interaction rate offers a crucial opportunity to issue an early warning to a core-collapse supernova. Some neutrino detectors, including KamLAND and Super-Kamiokande already operate pre-SN alarm systems based on a statistically significant excess of the observed event rate over the expected background. To improve alarm sensitivity, we propose an alarm method which incorporates the time evolution of the observed pre-SN neutrino event rate. The method uses a log likelihood ratio test that references multiple theoretical stellar-evolution models and treats the core collapse time as a nuisance parameter to be profiled over. The performance of the proposed method was evaluated using simulated data for the KamLAND, Super-Kamiokande with dissolved Gadolinium (SK-Gd) and their combined analysis. The results demonstrate a significant improvement in the warning time compared to the conventional rate-only method, while maintaining the same false alarm rate.
#### Fuzzy dark matter soliton core hosting a supermassive black hole as a dense low-mass perturber in strong gravitational lensing

 - **Abstract**
 Recent high-resolution imaging observations of strong lens systems reveal dense low-mass perturbers. We propose a soliton core, whose central density is boosted by a supermassive black hole (SMBH), in the fuzzy dark matter (FDM) model as an efficient perturber in strong gravitational lensing. The higher central density makes it less efficient in the tidal mass loss, and leads to the higher impact in gravitational lensing. We show that the mass profile of a $\sim 10^6M_\odot$ perturber in JVAS B1938+666, which does not resemble any known astronomical object, can be wel explained by a soliton core in the FDM model with the mass of $4\times 10^{-21}$eV hosting an SMBH with the mass of $4\times 10^5M_\odot$. The high mass of the SMBH may be explained by several scenarios that predcit heavy SMBH seeds such as the direct collapse black hole formation and primordial black holes.

 - **Abstract**
 Deuterated molecules are a useful diagnostic tool to probe the evolution and the kinematics in the earliest stages of star formation. Due to the low temperatures and high densities in the centre of pre-stellar cores, the deuterium fraction is enhanced by several orders of magnitude. We study the distribution of the emission and the deuteration of the two carbon chains HC3N and CH3CCH throughout the pre-stellar core L1544. We analyse emission maps of CH3CCH, CH2DCCH, CH3CCD, HC3N, HCC13CN, and DC3N, observed with the IRAM 30m single-dish radio telescope. We use non-LTE radiative transfer calculations, combined with chemical modelling of the molecular abundances, to constrain physical parameters of the observed species. Following this, we derive the column density and deuteration maps. We find D-fractions of N(DC3N)/N(HC3N)=0.04-0.07, N(CH2DCCH)/N(CH3CCH)=0.09-0.15, and N(CH3CCD)/N(CH3CCH)=0.07-0.09. The deuteration of HC3N appears homogeneous across the core, with widespread D-fraction values above 0.06, tracing intermediate-density gas in the outer layers of the core. CH3CCD is most efficiently formed in the higher-density regions towards the core centre, while the D-fraction of CH2DCCH traces a local density enhancement in the north-east of the core, coinciding with the CH3OH emission peak. The results suggest that gas-phase reactions dominate the formation and deuteration of both HC3N and CH3CCH in L1544, with spatial variations driven by physical structure, density and external radiation. The significantly higher D-fraction of CH2DCCH compared to CH3CCD and a tentative gradient with higher values in the north suggest different deuteration mechanisms for the two functional groups. Similarities between the CH2DCCH emission and CH2DOH might indicate an additional deuteration pathway of CH3CCH on the surfaces of dust grains, as observed for H2CO.
#### Failed ejection and oscillations of a current-carrying filament balanced by gravity

 - **Abstract**
 In this study, we investigate the post-destabilization evolution of a filament in a gravity-balanced model. We adopt the filament model proposed by Solov'ev (2010), in which a dense filament is supported against gravity by the repulsive force between the filament current and its sub-photospheric image. We first performed an analytical investigation of this model. For the numerical study, we use a two-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) model that solves the MHD equations with the Lare2d numerical code. Results: In this filament model, analytical expressions are derived for the electric current density, plasma density, and their spatial distributions as functions of the model parameters. The total electric current and the filament weight are also calculated. For the numerical simulations, we constructed an equilibrium filament characterized by a magnetic field of $B_0$ = $10^{-3}$ T, mass density $\rho_0$ ~ 1.3 x $10^{-9}$ kg m$^{-3}$, and temperature T ~ 13000 K. The system was destabilized either by increasing the currents or by reducing the filament density, and its evolution was computed. In both destabilization regimes, the filament was ejected, then halted at a certain altitude, and subsequently fell back, repeating this cycle with a period of about 600 s. The maximum filament ejection velocity was approximately 80 and 40 km $s^{-1}$, respectively. Beneath the ejected filament a current sheet forms, where magnetic reconnection occurs. The maximum ejection altitudes were determined as functions of both the destabilizing currents and the degree of filament plasma dilution. Finally, we compared results of this MHD model with those of an ideal vacuum model and discussed all results.

 - **Abstract**
 JWST observations provide for the first time evidence for an atmosphere on a rocky exoplanet - 55 Cnc e. The atmosphere of 55 Cnc e is hot with $\text{T}_{\text{eq}}>2000$K and shows strong variability, for which cloud formation above a molten crust could be one possible explanation. The composition of the atmosphere of 55 Cnc e is still unknown but suggests the presence of volatiles. We have run cloud formation models on a grid of N-dominated, O-dominated, C-dominated and H-dominated atmospheres to investigate which type of cloud we could expect on hot super-Earths and hot sub-Neptunes ($1000$K $<$ T $<$ $3000$K). Our models combine radiative transfer with equilibrium chemistry of the gaseous and condensed phases, vertical mixing of condensable species, sedimentation, nucleation and coagulation. We find that the condensability of species is highly dependent on the oxygen abundance of an atmosphere. Oxygen poor atmospheres can be heated by UV and optical absorbers PS, TiO and CN which create temperature inversions. These inhibit condensation. Oxygen rich atmospheres are colder without temperature inversions, and are therefore more favourable environments for cloud formation. The major expected cloud component in O-dominated atmospheres with solar refractory abundance is TiO$_2$(s). Spectral features of clouds in these worlds are stronger in transmission than in emission, in particular at short wavelengths. We find a lack of optical data of solid species in comparison to the variety of stable cloud components which can form on hot, rocky planets.

 - **Abstract**
 Tunnelling reactions of molecules embedded on cryogenic noble-gas matrices are being used in fundamental studies of how reactivity varies with the nature of the supposedly inert matrix as well as pointers to the chemistry occurring in the interstellar medium on ice-grains. To these ends we present chemical kinetic rate constants for the \textit{cis} to \textit{trans} isomerisation of seleno-, thio- and monomeric formic acids and that of their three dimeric species, based on multidimensional calculations in the gas-phase, from 10~K to 300~K as a guide to the matrix reactions.

 - **Abstract**
 Magnetars are extreme neutron stars powered by ultra-strong magnetic fields ($\sim10^{14}$ Gauss) and are compelling engines for some of the most powerful extragalactic transients such as Super Luminous Supernovae, Gamma-Ray Bursts, and Fast Radio Bursts. Yet their formation rate relative to ordinary neutron stars remains uncertain, often precluding direct comparisons with the rates of these extragalactic transients. Furthermore, magnetars have been recently shown to be evolutionarily related to other neutron star classes, complicating the estimate of the exact magnetar fraction within the neutron star population. We study the magnetar birth fraction in core-collapse supernovae using pulsar population synthesis of all isolated neutron star classes in our Galaxy, incorporating self-consistently the Galactic dynamical evolution, spin-down and magneto-thermal evolution. This approach allows us to derive strong constraints from small close-to-complete observational samples. In particular, looking at the age-limited young ($<$2 kyr) neutron star population in the Milky Way we find 24 detected young neutron stars, with only 10 of them (41%) being classical rotational powered pulsars, while the others (59%) are either magnetars or central compact objects, the latter believed to be equally magnetically powered. We further compare the results with the nearby volume-limited class ($<$500 pc) of X-ray Dim Isolated Neutron stars, old nearby magnetars. We conclude that the observed population of isolated neutron stars in the Galaxy can be reproduced only by assuming a core-collapse supernova rate larger than two, and a larger magnetar fraction than previously inferred. By assuming a bimodal initial magnetic field ($B_0$) distribution at birth, we find that the magnetar class peaks between $B_0\sim 1-2.5\times10^{14}$ Gauss and represents on average $\sim50$% of the entire neutron star population.

 - **Abstract**
 FarView is a proposed low frequency radio interferometer for deployment on the lunar far side, enabled by the Moon's radio quiet environment. Operating over 1-50 MHz inaccessible from Earth, FarView will open a new observational window and promote discovery class science in cosmology, heliophysics, Galactic and exoplanet astrophysics. The primary science is measurement of the redshifted 21 cm signal from the Cosmic Dark Ages (z=30-100), identified by the Astro2020 Decadal Survey as a priority cosmology discovery area. FarView will deliver 3D tomographic measurements and precision power spectra of neutral hydrogen in a largely linear regime, enabling tests of inflationary initial conditions, primordial non Gaussianity, dark matter properties, neutrino masses, and early dark energy. The reference design consists of 100000 crossed dipole antennas in a dense core-halo configuration spanning 200 sq km. A compact 4 km core with 83000 dipoles maximizes sensitivity to large scale cosmological modes, while 20000 halo elements extending to 14 km provide angular resolution and calibration for foreground characterization. Sensitivity forecasts indicate a 10-sigma detection of the Dark Ages 21 cm power spectrum at z=30 over five years of half duty cycle lunar night observations. An FFT-based EPIC beamformer is identified as an efficient signal processing architecture. Beyond cosmology, FarView will enable interferometric imaging of low frequency solar radio bursts, advancing space weather studies. Additional capabilities include stellar space weather observations, Galactic cosmic ray tomography via free-free absorption, and searches for auroral radio emission from exoplanet magnetospheres, a probe of exoplanet habitability. FarView represents a flagship class opportunity to establish the Moon as a platform for foundational astrophysics while delivering unique observational capabilities.

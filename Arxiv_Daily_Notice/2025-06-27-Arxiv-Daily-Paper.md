 - **Abstract**
 Stellar-mass black holes (BHs) represent the natural end states of massive stars. It is estimated that $10^8$ stellar-mass BHs are present in the Milky Way galaxy, a significant fraction of which are expected to be isolated. Despite their expected abundance, only about 20 have been detected so far - mostly in binary systems - with just one confirmed isolated black hole (IsoBH) identified via astrometric microlensing. In this study, we investigate the potential for detecting electromagnetic emissions from IsoBHs by generating synthetic model spectra of their emissions in different types of interstellar medium environments. These model spectra are then compared with current observational capabilities. We show that photons emitted by IsoBHs - especially those accreting material in dense environments or within the Solar neighborhood - should be readily detectable. However, confidently identifying these sources remains highly challenging. We conclude that a number of IsoBHs must already exist in current astronomical catalogs but have not been identified as such. We outline possible strategies for detection and identification of IsoBHs using the current and upcoming telescopes.

 - **Abstract**
 Fast neutrino flavor conversion may impact the explosion mechanism and nucleosynthesis in core-collapse supernovae. A necessary condition for fast flavor conversion is the presence of crossings in the angular distribution of the electron-neutrino lepton number (ELN crossing). Because of the computational costs, flavor-dependent angular distributions are not computed by the vast majority of state-of-the-art hydrodynamical simulations; instead, angular distributions are reconstructed employing approximate methods in post-processing. In this work, we evaluate the performance of four methods adopted to diagnose the existence of ELN crossings. For selected post-bounce times, we extract the fluid and thermodynamic properties from spherically symmetric supernova simulations for an $18.6 M_\odot$ progenitor, testing cases with and without muons as well as with and without mixing-length treatment of proto-neutron star convection. We compare the occurrence of crossings in the angular distributions obtained by solving the Boltzmann equations with those in distributions reconstructed from angular moments of our Boltzmann solutions by using the maximum entropy and Minerbo schemes, and also with crossings identified via a polynomial weighting function applied to the angular moments. Our results show that the polynomial method and the Minerbo closure scheme have severe limitations. The maximum entropy approach captures most of the forward crossings, although it fails to reproduce or misidentifies crossings in a subset of our models. These findings highlight the need for robust modeling of the neutrino angular properties in order to assess the impact of flavor conversion on the supernova mechanism.

 - **Abstract**
 We studied the properties of dark matter admixed-neutron stars (DMANS), considering fermionic dark matter (DM) that interacts gravitationally with hadronic matter (HM). Using relativistic mean-field equations of state (EoSs) for both components, we solved the two-fluid Tolman Oppenheimer Volkoff (TOV) equations to determine neutron star (NS) properties assuming that DM is confined within the stellar core. For hadronic matter, we employed realistic EoSs derived from low energy nuclear physics experiments, heavy-ion collision data, and NS observations. To constrain key dark matter parameters such as particle mass, mass fraction, and the coupling to mass ratio, we applied Bayesian inference, incorporating various astrophysical data including mass, radii, and NICER mass-radius distributions for PSR J0740+6620 and PSR J0030+0451. Additionally, we explored the influence of high-density HM EoSs and examined the impact of stiffer hadronic EoSs, excluding the vector meson self-interaction term. Our findings indicate that current astrophysical observations primarily constrain the dark matter fraction, while providing limited constraints on the particle mass or coupling. However, the dark matter fraction is largely insensitive to how astrophysical observations or uncertainties in the high-density EoS are incorporated. Instead, it is predominantly determined by the stiffness of the hadronic EoS at high densities, with stiffer hadronic EoSs yielding a higher dark matter mass fraction. Therefore, we conclude that the dark matter fraction plays a crucial role in shaping the properties of DMANS. Future investigations incorporating more realistic EoSs and astrophysical observations of other compact objects may provide deeper insights into dark matter.

 - **Abstract**
 Modern observatories are designed to deliver increasingly detailed views of astrophysical signals. To fully realize the potential of these observations, principled data-analysis methods are required to effectively separate and reconstruct the underlying astrophysical components from data corrupted by noise and instrumental effects. In this work, we introduce a novel multi-frequency Bayesian model of the sky emission field that leverages latent-space tension as an indicator of model misspecification, enabling automated separation of diffuse, point-like, and extended astrophysical emission components across wavelength bands. Deviations from latent-space prior expectations are used as diagnostics for model misspecification, thus systematically guiding the introduction of new sky components, such as point-like and extended sources. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method on synthetic multi-frequency imaging data and apply it to observational X-ray data from the eROSITA Early Data Release (EDR) of the SN1987A region in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). Our results highlight the method's capability to reconstruct astrophysical components with high accuracy, achieving sub-pixel localization of point sources, robust separation of extended emission, and detailed uncertainty quantification. The developed methodology offers a general and well-founded framework applicable to a wide variety of astronomical datasets, and is therefore well suited to support the analysis needs of next-generation multi-wavelength and multi-messenger surveys.
#### A Black Hole is Born: 3D GRMHD Simulation of Black Hole Formation from Core-Collapse

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first three-dimensional, fully general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (3D GRMHD) simulation of a black hole (BH) formed from the collapsed core of a massive star. The ability to self-consistently capture the birth of a compact remnant in 3D is crucial for modeling natal BH properties (including masses, spins, and kicks), which are of particular interest in the era of gravitational wave astronomy. However, such simulations have remained elusive due to extreme computational challenges and demands. We employ the GPU-accelerated dynamical-spacetime GRMHD code GRaM-X to follow the collapse, core-bounce, shock propagation, and eventual BH formation of a massive stellar progenitor in full 3D. We initialize our simulation by mapping a one-dimensional (1D) model of a star with a zero-age-main-sequence mass of $45 M_\odot$ to 3D. We use moderate rotation (consistent with expectations from stellar evolution modeling) and a relatively weak dipolar magnetic field. The collapsing core drives a shock that reaches a maximum radius of roughly 170 km before stalling and does not lead to a successful explosion. The proto-neutron star accretes matter before collapsing to form a BH $t_{BH} \approx 325$ ms after core-bounce. The time of BH formation and initial BH mass are remarkably similar to those obtained with GR1D, a 1D general-relativistic neutrino-hydrodynamics code, to which we compare our results. We track the horizon of the newborn BH after formation and calculate a steady kick velocity of $v_{kick} \approx 72$ km/s and a mass of $M_{BH} \approx 2.62 M_\odot$, which is still rising at the end of the simulation.
#### Stellar Dynamics in Open Clusters Increases the Binary Fraction and Mass Ratios: Evidence from Photometric Binaries in 35 Open Clusters

 - **Abstract**
 Using the Bayesian Analysis of Stellar Evolution-9 (BASE-9) code and Gaia DR3, Pan-STARRS, and 2MASS data, we identify photometric binaries in 35 open clusters (OCs) and constrain their masses. We find a strong correlation between the binary fraction and cluster dynamical age and an even stronger correlation between core binary fraction and cluster dynamical age. We find the binary mass-ratio (q) distribution of dynamically young OCs is statistically distinct from that of the old OCs. On average, dynamically young OCs display multi-modal q distributions rising toward unity and toward our detection limit of q=0.5 while more dynamically evolved clusters display more uniform q distributions often with a peak near q=1. Interestingly, the uniform q distribution with a peak near q=1 is consistent with binaries in the field. We also observe a similar transition from multi-modal to unimodal q distributions when comparing low mass to high mass OCs in our sample. Lastly, we find a correlation between the median q of the binary population in a cluster and the cluster dynamical age. We interpret these results as an indication that dynamical encounters tend to increase the fraction of high-mass-ratio binaries within a given cluster -- particularly within the cluster's core where stellar dynamics are likely more important. This may be the result of stellar exchanges that tend to produce binaries with larger q and/or the preferential disruption or evaporation of lower q binaries.

 - **Abstract**
 Hot cores are small ($\lesssim$0.1 pc), dense ($\geq$10$^6$ cm$^{-3}$), and hot ($>$100 K) regions around massive protostars and are one of the main production sites of complex organic molecules (COMs, $\geq6$ atoms, including carbon). The Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) is an ideal place to study hot core and COM formation in an environment that is different from our Galaxy, though prior to this study there have only been nine detections of extragalactic hot cores (seven in the LMC and two in the Small Magellanic Cloud, SMC). Here, we report 1.2 mm continuum and molecular line observations with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) in the star-forming region N160 that we named N160A-mm. We identify six 1.2 mm continuum sources, four of which are associated with methanol (CH$_3$OH) emission. Another COM, methyl cyanide (CH$_3$CN) is associated with the brightest source, N160A-mmA, the most chemically rich source in the field. Using the XCLASS software, we perform spectral modeling to estimate rotational temperatures and total column densities of detected molecular species for four sources. Based on the temperature exceeding 100 K, small size, and high H$_2$ number density, we identify N160A-mmA as a hot core. We compare the molecular abundances of this newly detected hot core with those previously detected in the LMC and SMC, as well as with a sample of Galactic hot cores, and discuss the complex nature of N160A-mmA.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent cosmological observations have achieved high-precision measurements of the Universe's expansion history, prompting the use of nonparametric methods such as Gaussian processes (GP) regression. We apply GP regression for reconstructing the Hubble parameter using CC data, with improved covariance modeling and latest study in CC data. By comparing reconstructions in redshift space $z$ and transformed space $\log(z+1)$ , we evaluate six kernel functions using nested sampling (NS) and approximate Bayesian computation rejection (ABC rejection) methods and analyze the construction of Hubble constant $H_0$ in different models. Our analysis demonstrates that reconstructions in $\log(z+1)$ space remain physically reasonable, offering a viable alternative to conventional $z$ space approaches, while the introduction of nondiagonal covariance matrices leads to degraded reconstruction quality, suggesting that simplified diagonal forms may be preferable for reconstruction. These findings underscore the importance of task-specific kernel selection in GP-based cosmological inference. In particular, our findings suggest that careful preliminary screening of kernel functions, based on the physical quantities of interest, is essential for reliable inference in cosmological research using GP.
#### An H$α$ Cloud in the HI Tail: Recent Star Formation in the Outskirts of NGC 4258 Revealed by Nanshan 1-m Telescope

 - **Abstract**
 We present first-light deep H$\alpha$ imaging taken with the Nanshan 1-meter wide-field telescope on the local galaxy NGC 4258, alongside archival data from Hubble Space telescope (HST), Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope, and The Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey. The H$\alpha$ image shows ongoing star formation not only inside the galaxy but also in an HI cloud in the eastern HI tail, which is roughly 16 kpc away from the main galaxy. The HST images reveal several ultra-blue compact objects ($\rm F555W - F814W <-0.5 mag,\, FWHM\sim 0.2''$) in the H$\alpha$ bright region, aligned with the HI tail, suggesting the presence of young open cluster candidate in the HI tail. Our results suggest that wide field H$\alpha$ imaging is a valuable tool for investigating recent star formation in the extended regions of NGC 4258. Furthermore, the star formation in diffuse HI tails could highlight an potential aspect of galaxy stellar halo formation, warranting further investigation of the impact of star formation in halos on galaxy evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a comprehensive timing analysis of X-ray data from the {\it XMM-Newton} satellite, examining 50 light curves covering 17 years of observations of the blazar Mrk~421. This work uses classical deterministic and stochastic methods in a novel way, enabling the distinction of temporal scales and offering essential insights through correlations among parameters. Deterministic behaviors are primarily explored through recurrence quantification analysis (RQA), used innovatively by varying the threshold input parameter to examine variability at multiple temporal scales. To investigate behavior across various scales from a stochastic perspective, we apply both autoregressive moving average (ARMA) and autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models, with results from ARIMA more tightly related to short scales. Our findings reveal that Mrk~421's X-ray emission is a multifaceted process, driven by both deterministic and stochastic patterns, indicating a complex interplay of physical phenomena. Our study demonstrates that deterministic patterns are more pronounced at small temporal scales, which are disconnected from large scales. On the other hand, stochastic processes with memory propagate from large to small time scales, while noise affects both scales, as indicated by the correlation analysis. These results underscore the importance of advanced methodologies for interpreting astrophysical data, contributing to ongoing discussions in blazar physics by exploring connections between our calculated parameters and established models. The same approach can potentially be applied to other sources, enhancing our general understanding of variability and emission mechanisms in blazars.

 - **Abstract**
 The Statistical-likelihood Exoplanetary Habitability Index (SEPHI) serves as a valuable tool for prioritizing targets for further study and identifying potentially habitable environments. In this paper, we present SEPHI 2.0, which incorporates several key improvements: (1) updated methods for estimating exoplanet internal structures and magnetic fields; (2) the inclusion of orbital eccentricity in assessing the potential for liquid water on an exoplanet's surface; and (3) a new exoplanet mass-radius relationship. SEPHI 2.0 retains its probabilistic framework and combines the different subindexes by selecting the most restrictive one. In SEPHI 2.0, atmospheric retention is consolidated into a single index that incorporates both thermal (Jeans escape) and nonthermal (stellar wind and magnetic effect) processes. Recent advancements in estimating exoplanet internal structures and magnetic fields have been integrated. Additionally, a new empirical exoplanet mass-radius relationship is introduced. All this is incorporated into the SADE code, which uses key data on exoplanets and their host stars to assess habitability and prioritize targets for further study, providing a comprehensive output of an exoplanetary system's physical characteristics. SADE is available as a free online tool. Notably, this is the first approach to including estimated exoplanet magnetic 8elds in a habitability index. The SADE software facilitates the identification of potentially habitable exoplanets. Among the 5500+ confirmed exoplanets, only a few-such as Kepler-62f and GJ 514b achieve SEPHI 2.0 scores close to 1. It is also noticeable that, according to our studies, TRAPPIST-1 f and g are ranked higher than TRAPPIST-1 e in terms of habitability potential.
#### Element nucleosynthetic origins from abundance spatial distributions beyond the Milky Way

 - **Abstract**
 An element's astrophysical origin should be reflected in the spatial distribution of its abundance, yielding measurably different spatial distributions for elements with different nucleosynthetic sites. However, most extragalactic multi-element analyses of gas-phase abundances to date have been limited to small numbers of sightlines, making statistical characterization of differences in spatial distributions of elements impossible. Here we use integrated field spectroscopic data covering the full face of the nearby dwarf galaxy NGC 5253 sampled at 3.5-pc resolution to produce maps of the abundances of oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur using independent direct methods. We find strong evidence for differences in the elements' spatial statistics that mirror their predicted nucleosynthetic origins: the spatial distributions of oxygen and sulfur, both predominantly produced in core-collapse supernovae, indicate that initial injection occurs on larger scales than for nitrogen, which is predominantly produced by asymptotic giant branch stars. All elements are well-correlated but oxygen and sulfur are much better correlated with each other than with nitrogen, consistent with recent results for stellar abundances in the Milky Way. These findings both open a new avenue to test nucleosynthetic models, and make predictions for the structure of stellar chemical abundance distributions.
#### Sifting for a Stream: The Morphology of the $300S$ Stellar Stream

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar streams are sensitive laboratories for understanding the small-scale structure in our Galaxy's gravitational field. Here, we analyze the morphology of the $300S$ stellar stream, which has an eccentric, retrograde orbit and thus could be an especially powerful probe of both baryonic and dark substructures within the Milky Way. Due to extensive background contamination from the Sagittarius stream (Sgr), we perform an analysis combining Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey photometry, $\textit{Gaia}$ DR3 proper motions, and spectroscopy from the Southern Stellar Stream Spectroscopic Survey ($\textit{S}^5$). We redetermine the stream coordinate system and distance gradient, then apply two approaches to describe $300S$'s morphology. In the first, we analyze stars from $\textit{Gaia}$ using proper motions to remove Sgr. In the second, we generate a simultaneous model of $300S$ and Sgr based purely on photometric information. Both approaches agree within their respective domains and describe the stream over a region spanning $33^\circ$. Overall, $300S$ has three well-defined density peaks and smooth variations in stream width. Furthermore, $300S$ has a possible gap of $\sim 4.7^\circ$ and a kink. Dynamical modeling of the kink implies that $300S$ was dramatically influenced by the Large Magellanic Cloud. This is the first model of $300S$'s morphology across its entire known footprint, opening the door for deeper analysis to constrain the structures of the Milky Way.

 - **Abstract**
 Chemically-homogeneously evolving stars have been proposed to account for several exotic phenomena, including gravitational-wave emissions and gamma-ray bursts. Here we study whether these stars can explain the metal-poor dwarf galaxy, I Zwicky 18. We apply our synthetic spectral models from Paper II to (i) establish a classification sequence for these hot stars, (ii) predict the photonionizing flux and the strength of emission lines from a IZw18-like stellar population, and (iii) compare our predictions to available observations of this galaxy. Adding two new models computed with PoWR, we report (i) these stars to follow a unique sequence of classes: O->WN->WO (i.e. without ever being WC). From our population synthesis with standard assumptions, we predict that (ii) the source of the UV C-IV and other emission bumps is a couple dozen WO-type Wolf-Rayet stars (not WC as previously assumed) which are the result of chem.-hom. evolution, while these, combined with the rest of the O-star population, account for the He-II ionizing flux and spectral hardness. Contrasting our results against published optical and UV data and accounting for different aperture sizes and spatial regions probed by the observations, we find that (iii) our models are highly consistent with them. Since our "massive Pop II stars" might just as well exist in early star-forming regions, our findings have implications for upcoming JWST surveys; and given that our results apply for binary populations too as long as the same fraction (10%) of the systems evolves chem. homogeneously, we conclude that the stellar progenitors of gravitational waves may very well exist today in IZw18.
#### Hunting for UVdim stars in Galactic Open clusters. Clues from ultraviolet photometry

 - **Abstract**
 Split main-sequences (MSs) and extended main-sequence turn-offs (eMSTOs) have been observed in nearly all Magellanic Clouds clusters younger than 2 Gyr. More recently, Hubble Space Telescope (HST) ultraviolet photometry uncovered a puzzling new population of UV-absorbed stars, dubbed UVdim, in five Magellanic Clouds clusters aged between 40 and 200 Myr, as well as in one 1.5 Gyr-old cluster. These UVdim stars predominantly lie on the blue MS, which is composed of slow rotators, and their distinct UV properties are believed to stem from dusty circumstellar disks. Although eMSTOs are common in both Magellanic Clouds and Galactic open clusters (OCs) of comparable ages, UVdim stars have not yet been investigated in Galactic OCs. In this work, we fill that gap by combining Swift/UVOT, SkyMapper, and Gaia photometry to extend the search for UVdim stars to 35 Galactic OCs younger than 2 Gyr. By constructing colour-colour diagrams analogous to those employed with HST WFC3/UVIS, we find no evidence of UVdim-like stars in most Galactic open clusters and identify possible UVdim candidates in only five systems. The rarity of UVdim stars in young OCs suggests a potential difference between Magellanic Cloud clusters and their Milky Way counterparts, although the underlying reason remains unclear.
#### Natal kick by early-asymmetrical pairs of jets to the neutron star of supernova remnant S147

 - **Abstract**
 We analyze the bipolar morphology of the jet-shaped core-collapse supernova (CCSN) remnant (CCSNR) S147 and its neutron star (NS) kick velocity, and suggest that two pairs of unequal, opposite jets contributed to the NS kick velocity. This kick by early asymmetrical pairs (kick-BEAP) of jets mechanism operates within the framework of the jittering jets explosion mechanism (JJEM). We examine the prominent pair of large ears and, based on their flat structure rather than the more common conical structure of ears, conclude that two pairs of jets close in angle inflated the two opposite ears. We connect two opposite X-ray bright zones by an additional axis to create the full point-symmetric morphology of CCSNR S147. We propose that the two unequal jets that formed the X-ray bright zones imparted the first kick-BEAP, while the two pairs of jets that formed the ears imparted the second kick-BEAP. The two kick velocities are of about equal magnitude of ~450 km/s, which implies very energetic jets. Such jets can excite gravitational waves that present detectors can detect from the Galaxy and the Magellanic Clouds. We use the morphology we identify to estimate the CCSNR age at 23,000 yr. Our results strengthen the JJEM.

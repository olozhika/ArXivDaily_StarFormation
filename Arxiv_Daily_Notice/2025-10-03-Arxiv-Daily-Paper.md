 - **Abstract**
 We characterize the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) pulsar SXP 46.6 using NuSTAR observations conducted in 2017. The spin period (P) of this neutron star decreased from its discovered value of 46.6 s to a value of 45.984(1) s, indicating a spin-up at the rate of \dot{P} = -1.13 x 10^{-9} s s^{-1}. This spin-up rate is used to calculate a high pulsar magnetic field value of 2.25 x 10^{13} G. This process also gives a low magnetic field value, which we rule out here by constraining the inner accretion disk radius to be less than the radius of the innermost stable circular orbit. The pulse profile, analyzed in soft, hard, and broad X-ray bands, shows a double-peaked structure, consistent with pencil beam emission from two antipodal hot spots on the neutron star surface. We also perform spin phase-resolved spectroscopy for the first time, revealing spectral variations across different phases of the pulsar's rotation. These results offer new insights into the long-term spin evolution and emission properties of SXP 46.6.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the detection of high-energy $\gamma$-ray emission in the vicinity of G172.8+1.5, which is debated as a Supernova remnant (SNR) or an ionized hydrogen (H$_{\rm{II}}$) region. Using 16-yr Pass 8 data from Fermi Large Area Telescope (Fermi-LAT), we found the GeV emission can be described by two extended sources with different photon spectra. Among them, the much more extended $\gamma$-ray source SrcA with a Power-law spectrum is spatially coincident with a giant neutral Hydrogen shell structure and several OB stars inside a huge H$_{\rm{II}}$ region. The softer Log-Parabola spectra $\gamma$-ray source SrcB is spatially coincident with a star-forming region with several OB stars, maser sources and IR sources. Gas observation results display a dense molecular cloud surrounding SrcB in the velocity range of [-25,-5] km s$^{-1}$. The possible origins of $\gamma$-ray emission are discussed, including CRs escaped from SNR shock surface and illuminated nearby MC, the young massive star clusters associated with the star-forming region and a pulsar halo generated by an invisible energetic pulsar inside the SNR. Furthermore, under the hadronic scenario, the measured diffusion coefficient in the compact SrcB region is significantly lower than that of the more extended SrcA. This suppression is likely attributed to cosmic-ray-driven instabilities, which reduce the diffusion efficiency in the vicinity of the source relative to the standard conditions in the interstellar medium (ISM). Future advanced analysis from LHAASO observation results would help distinguish the origins of $\gamma$-ray emission in this region and clarify the nature of this source.
#### Pinpointing the location of the gamma-ray emitting region in the FSRQ 4C+01.28

 - **Abstract**
 The FSRQ 4C+01.28 is a bright and highly variable radio and $\gamma$-ray emitter. We aim to pinpoint the location of the $\gamma$-ray emitting region within its jet in order to derive strong constraints on $\gamma$-ray emission models for blazar jets. We use radio and $\gamma$-ray data obtained with ALMA, OVRO, SMA and Fermi/LAT to study the cross-correlation between $\gamma$-ray and multi-frequency radio light curves. Moreover, we employ VLBA observations at 43 GHz over a period of around nine years to study the parsec-scale jet kinematics. To pinpoint the location of the $\gamma$-ray emitting region, we use a model in which outbursts shown in the $\gamma$-ray and radio light curves are produced when moving jet components pass through the $\gamma$-ray emitting and the radio core regions. We find two bright and compact newly ejected jet components that are likely associated with a high activity period visible in the $\gamma$-ray and radio light curves. The kinematic analysis of the VLBA observations leads to a maximum apparent jet speed of $\beta_{app}=19\pm10$ and an upper limit on the viewing angle of $\phi$ < 4 deg. We determine the power law indices that are characterizing the jet geometry, brightness temperature distribution, and core shift to be $l=0.974\pm0.098$, $s=-3.31\pm0.31$, and $k_r=1.09\pm0.17$, which are in agreement with a conical jet in equipartition. A cross-correlation analysis shows that the radio light curves follow the $\gamma$-ray light curve. We pinpoint the location of the $\gamma$-ray emitting region with respect to the jet base to the range of $2.6\,\mathrm{pc}\leq d_\gamma\leq20\,\mathrm{pc}$. Our derived observational limits places the location of $\gamma$-ray production in 4C+01.28 beyond the expected extent of the broad-line region (BLR) and therefore challenges blazar-emission models that rely on inverse Compton up-scattering of seed photons from the BLR.

 - **Abstract**
 Motivated by recent detections of low-mass perturbers in strong gravitational lensing systems, we investigate analogs of these objects in the Concerto suite, a set of cosmological N-body zoom-in simulations of self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) with high-amplitude, velocity-dependent cross sections. We investigate characteristic halo properties relevant to gravitational imaging measurements, focusing on the projected enclosed mass and the central density slope. In SIDM, these quantities evolve continuously through gravothermal processes, spanning core-expansion and core-collapse phases, in sharp contrast to cold dark matter, where they remain nearly static after halo formation. This SIDM evolution further depends on tidal environment and merger history, which can be probed through strong lensing. We also identify simulated SIDM halos whose properties are consistent with the properties of low-mass perturbers inferred from recent observations, and we demonstrate that the core-collapse mechanism offers a compelling explanation for their observed high densities. Our results highlight the potential of strong gravitational lensing as a powerful probe of dark matter self-interactions.

 - **Abstract**
 Gravitational-wave (GW) emissions from core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) provide insights into the internal processes leading up to their explosions. Theory predicts that CCSN explosions are driven by hydrodynamical instabilities like the standing accretion shock instability (SASI) or neutrino-driven convection, and simulations show that these mechanisms emit GWs at low frequencies ($\lesssim 0.25 \,{\rm kHz}$). Thus the detection of low-frequency GWs, or lack thereof, is useful for constraining explosion mechanisms in CCSNe. This paper introduces the dedicated-frequency framework, which is designed to follow-up GW burst detections using bandpass analyses. The primary aim is to study whether low-frequency (LF) follow-up analyses, limited to $\leq 256 \,{\rm Hz}$, constrain CCSN explosion models in practical observing scenarios. The analysis dataset comprises waveforms from five CCSN models with different strengths of low-frequency GW emissions induced by SASI and/or neutrino-driven convection, injected into the Advanced LIGO data from the Third Observing Run (O3). Eligible candidates for the LF follow-up must satisfy a benchmark detection significance and are identified using the coherent WaveBurst (cWB) algorithm. The LF follow-up analyses are performed using the BayesWave algorithm. Both cWB and BayesWave make minimal assumptions about the signal's morphology. The results suggest that the successful detection of a CCSN in the LF follow-up analysis constrains its explosion mechanism. The dedicated-frequency framework also has other applications. As a demonstration, the loudest trigger from the SN 2019fcn supernova search is followed-up using a high-frequency (HF) analysis, limited to $\geq 256 \,{\rm Hz}$. The trigger has negligible power below $256 \, {\rm Hz}$, and the HF analysis successfully enhances its detection significance.

 - **Abstract**
 HEALPix (Hierarchical Equal Area isoLatitude Pixelization) is a widely adopted spherical grid system in astrophysics, cosmology, and Earth sciences. Its equal-area, iso-latitude structure makes it particularly well-suited for large-scale data analysis on the sphere. However, implementing high-performance spherical harmonic transforms (SHTs) on HEALPix grids remains challenging due to irregular pixel geometry, latitude-dependent alignments, and the demands for high-resolution transforms at scale. In this work, we present cuHPX, an optimized CUDA library that provides functionality for spherical harmonic analysis and related utilities on HEALPix grids. Beyond delivering substantial performance improvements, cuHPX ensures high numerical accuracy, analytic gradients for integration with deep learning frameworks, out-of-core memory-efficient optimization, and flexible regridding between HEALPix, equiangular, and other common spherical grid formats. Through evaluation, we show that cuHPX achieves rapid spectral convergence and delivers over 20 times speedup compared to existing libraries, while maintaining numerical consistency. By combining accuracy, scalability, and differentiability, cuHPX enables a broad range of applications in climate science, astrophysics, and machine learning, effectively bridging optimized GPU kernels with scientific workflows.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent observations from NICER in X-rays and LIGO/Virgo in gravitational waves have provided critical constraints on the mass, radius, and tidal deformability of neutron stars, imposing stringent limits on the equation of state (EOS) and the behavior of ultra-dense matter. However, several key parameters influencing the EOS, such as the maximum mass of neutron stars, spin-down rates, and the potential role of exotic matter in their cores, remain subject of ongoing debate. Here we present a new approach to constraining the EOS by analyzing the X-ray afterglows of some short gamma-ray bursts, focusing on "the internal plateau" phase and its abrupt decay, which reflect the spin-down and possible collapse of a supra-massive neutron star into a black hole. By linking critical neutron star masses with black hole formation criteria and the observational data from Swift's BAT and XRT instruments with compact object models, we explore three representative EOSs that range from "soft" to "stiff". Our result supports a maximum mass for neutron stars of approximately 2.39 solar masses at the threshold of black hole formation. This conclusion holds under assumptions of magnetar-powered X-ray plateaus, constant radiative efficiency, isotropic emission, and full Kerr black hole energy extraction; deviations could influence the inferred results. Our results demonstrate the critical role of neutron star/black hole physics in probing dense nuclear matter and provide a novel framework for exploring extreme astrophysical environments.

 - **Abstract**
 Spacecraft measurements of Mercury indicate it has a core dynamo with a surface field of 200-800 nT. These data also indicate that the crust contains remanent magnetization likely produced by an ancient magnetic field. The inferred magnetization intensity is consistent with a wide range of paleofield strengths (0.2-50 uT), possibly indicating that Mercury once had a dynamo field much stronger than today. Recent modeling of ancient lunar impacts has demonstrated that plasma generated during basin-formation can transiently amplify a planetary dynamo field near the surface. Simultaneous impact-induced pressure waves can then record these fields in the form of crustal shock remanent magnetization (SRM). Here, we present impact hydrocode and magnetohydrodynamic simulations of a Caloris-size basin (~1,550 km diameter) formation event. Our results demonstrate that the ancient magnetospheric field (~0.5-0.9 uT) created by the interaction of the ancient interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) and Mercury's dynamo field can be amplified by the plasma up to ~13 uT and, via impact pressure waves, be recorded as SRM in the basin antipode. Such magnetization could produce ~5 nT crustal fields at 20-km altitude antipodal to Caloris detectable by future spacecraft like BepiColombo. Furthermore, impacts in the southern hemisphere that formed ~1,000 km diameter basins (e.g., Andal-Coleridge, Matisse-Repin, Eitkou-Milton, and Sadi-Scopus) could impart crustal magnetization in the northern hemisphere, contributing to the overall remanent field measured by MESSENGER. Overall, the impact plasma amplification process can contribute to crustal magnetization on airless bodies and should be considered when reconstructing dynamo history from crustal anomaly measurements.

 - **Abstract**
 The star K2-19 hosts a pair of Neptunian planets deep inside the 3:2 resonance. They induce strong transit-timing variations with two incommensurate frequencies. Previous photodynamical modeling of 3.3 years of transit and radial velocity data produced mass estimates of 32.4 +/- 1.7 M_E and 10.8 +/- 0.6 M_E for planets b and c, respectively, and corresponding eccentricity estimates of 0.20 +/- 0.03 and 0.21 +/- 0.03. These high eccentricities raise questions about the formation origin of the system, and this motivated us to extend the observing baseline in an attempt to better constrain their values. We present a photodynamical analysis of 10 years of transit data that confirms the previous mass estimates (30.8 +/- 1.3 M_E and 11.1 +/- 0.4 M_E), but reduces the median eccentricities to 0.04 +/- 0.02 and 0.07 +/- 0.02 for b and c, respectively. These values are more consistent with standard formation models, but still involve nonzero free eccentricity. The previously reported high eccentricities appear to be due to a single transit for which measurements taken at twilight mimicked ingress. This resulted in a 12-minute error in the midtransit time. The data that covered 1.3 and 5 so-called super and resonant periods were used to match a Fourier analysis of the transit-timing variation signal with simple analytic expressions for the frequencies and amplitudes to obtain planet mass estimates within 2% of the median photodynamical values, regardless of the eccentricities. Theoretical details of the analysis are presented in a companion paper. Additionally, we identified a possible planet candidate situated exterior to the b-c pair. Finally, in contrast to a previous study, our internal structure modeling of K2-19 b yields a metal mass fraction that is consistent with core accretion.

 - **Abstract**
 We present three rare and striking extragalactic radio sources discovered through visual inspection of low-frequency continuum maps from LoTSS DR2 and TGSS by the RAD@home citizen-science collaboratory. The first, RAD J131346.9+500320, is the first clear Odd Radio Circle (ORC) identified in LoTSS. At photometric $z \sim$ 0.94, it hosts a pair of intersecting rings of ~300 kpc diameter, embedded in diffuse emission extending over ~800 kpc, making it both the most distant and most powerful ORC reported to date. Its steep spectrum $\alpha_{54}^{144}=1.22\pm0.15$) points to a relic synchrotron origin. The second object, RAD J122622.6+640622, is a ~865 kpc giant radio galaxy whose southern jet is abruptly deflected, inflating a ~100 kpc limb-brightened ring, while the northern jet terminates in a compact hotspot-like feature. The third, RAD J142004.0+621715 (~440 kpc), shows a comparable ring at the end of its northern filamentary jet, along with a secondary filament parallel to its southern jet. All three systems lie in $\sim10^{14}M_\odot$ clusters or group-scale haloes, suggesting that environmental density gradients and possible jet-galaxy interactions play a central role in shaping these ring morphologies. These discoveries expand the zoo of extragalactic radio morphologies, highlight the diversity of pathways that can generate ring-like synchrotron structures, and demonstrate the continuing importance of human pattern recognition in identifying rare sources that escape current automated pipelines.

 - **Abstract**
 Mercury is the only other terrestrial planet in the solar system with an active dynamo magnetic field (~200 nT at the equatorial surface). Furthermore, Mercury's ~3.9-3.7 billion-year old (Ga) crust is strongly magnetized (~10 nT at ~30-km altitude), indicating the presence of a past dynamo. However, the source and strength of the field that magnetized this crust are unknown. To address this, we performed three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations of the ancient solar wind interaction with the planetary field and coupled them with thermal cooling and magnetization models. We show that the crustal magnetization was likely produced by a surface field of at least ~2,000 nT, likely >10,000 nT (i.e., ~10x or ~50-100x stronger than at present). Such strong fields likely exclude both the solar wind feedback and thermoelectric mechanisms for driving the dynamo at 3.7 Ga ago. Instead, our results are compatible with the past dynamo being powered by an enhanced energy flux that drove strong core convection.

 - **Abstract**
 Brown dwarfs are essential probes of stellar and planetary formation, yet their low luminosities pose challenges for detection at large Galactic distances. The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), with its unprecedented near-infrared sensitivity, enables the discovery and characterization of distant substellar objects, including those in the Milky Way's thick disk and halo. We conducted a systematic search using over 40,000 publicly available JWST/NIRSpec PRISM/CLEAR spectra and identified 68 brown dwarfs through spectral template matching and visual inspection. Among them, 12 are newly identified candidates, including 8 T dwarfs and 4 M/L dwarfs, most at distances exceeding 1 kpc. Remarkably, two sources -- JWST J001418.22-302223.2 and JWST J033240.07-274907.8 -- are found at distances greater than 5 kpc, making them the most distant brown dwarfs within the Milky Way. Spectral fits were performed using a nested sampling Monte Carlo algorithm with three model grids: Sonora Elf Owl, LOWZ, and SAND. The analysis reveals that cloud-free models are unable to reproduce L/T transition spectra, whereas the SAND model provides a more accurate representation of cloud effects in metal-poor environments. With the newly identified distant brown dwarfs, we also investigated the vertical metallicity gradient of brown dwarfs. Overall, the metallicities do not show an evident trend with Galactic height $|Z|$, due to the limited sample size and the uncertainties in metallicity measurements.

 - **Abstract**
 The supernova remnant (SNR) S147 contains the pulsar PSR J0538+2817 and a likely unbound binary companion, HD 37424. It is the only good Galactic candidate for a binary unbound by a core-collapse supernova (SN). Using Gaia DR3 parallaxes and photometry, we select the stars local to SNR S147 in a cylinder with a projected radius of $100$ pc and a parallax range of $0.614 < \varpi < 0.787$ mas (a length of $\simeq 360$ pc). We individually model the most luminous of these stars. The two most luminous single stars are the unbound binary companion, HD 37424, and HD 37367, with estimated masses of $(13.51\pm0.05) M_{\odot}$ and $(14.30\pm0.09) M_{\odot}$, respectively. The two most luminous binary systems are the spectroscopic binary HD 37366 and the eclipsing binary ET Tau that have primary masses of $(20.9\pm0.12) M_{\odot}$ and $(16.7\pm0.09) M_{\odot}$, respectively. We model the Gaia color-magnitude diagram (CMD) of this local stellar population using both single stars and a model consisting of noninteracting binaries using Solar metallicity PARSEC isochrones. For both models, the estimated age distributions of the $439$ $M_{G} < 0$ mag stars favor a high mass progenitor of $21.5M_{\odot}-41.1M_{\odot}$ for the SN.

 - **Abstract**
 Sulfur is a critical element to life on Earth, and with detections of sulfur-bearing molecules in exoplanets and comets, questions arise as to how sulfur is incorporated into planets in the first place. In order to understand sulfur's journey from molecular clouds to planets, we need to understand the molecular forms that sulfur takes in protoplanetary disks, where the rotational emission from sulfur-bearing molecules in the gas phase indicates a very low abundance. To address this question, we have updated the 2D time-dependent disk chemical modeling framework of Fogel et al. (2011) to incorporate several new sulfur species and hundreds of new sulfur reactions from the literature. Specifically, we investigate the main molecular forms that sulfur takes in a disk orbiting a solar mass young T Tauri star. We explore the effects of different volatile (reactive) sulfur abundances, C/O ratios, initial sulfur molecular forms, and cosmic-ray ionization rates. We find that a high C/O ratio can explain both the prevalence of CS observed in disks and the lack of SO detections, consistent with previous results. Additionally, initial sulfur form greatly affects the ice abundances in the lower layers of the disk, which has implications for comet formation and future observations with JWST.
#### Understanding the Origins of Super-Puff Planets: A New Mass-Loss Regime Coupled to Planetary Evolution

 - **Abstract**
 Super-puffs are a class of low-mass, large-radius planets that have challenged planet formation and evolution models. Their high inferred H/He mass fractions, required to explain their physical sizes, would lead to rapid atmospheric escape, raising questions about their long-term retention. Recent modeling work indicates that low-mass planets typically require 50\% less H/He mass to match their observed radius, due to significant roles of the radiative atmosphere and interior heating from the rock/iron core. Here, through a new quantitative analysis of XUV-driven escape in sub-Neptunes, we find that previous studies overestimated mass loss, as scaling laws in low-gravity regimes deviate greatly from the widely used energy-limited regime. We define a new regime, thermal-energy-mediated photoevaporation (TEMP), in which thermal energy conversion critically sets the mass-loss rate. These effects make super-puffs more resilient to mass loss than previously thought. We develop a coupled evolution model integrating this updated thermal evolution framework with a 1D hydrodynamic photoevaporation model. Applying this novel, joint model to observed super-puffs and young low-density planets, we find that their masses, radii and transit pressures align with predictions assuming either a clear or hazy atmosphere. This indicates that super-puffs have undergone a combination of boil-off and photoevaporative mass loss, with boil-off dominating the process. Our results indicate that low-density planets typically possess both a thick convective envelope and substantial radiative atmosphere, which contribute to their large radii. For this to occur, these planets must have intermediate masses of 5-10$M_\oplus$ and receive stellar insolation $\lesssim 30F_\oplus$, favoring FG-type stars over M-dwarfs.

 - **Abstract**
 Using the one-dimensional stellar evolution code MESA, we find that all our models in the initial mass range of 12-40 Mo, regardless of whether they have hydrogen-rich, hydrogen-stripped, or helium+hydrogen-stripped envelopes, have at least one significant strong convective zone in the inner core, which can facilitate the jittering-jets explosion mechanism (JJEM). We focus on stripped-envelope CCSN progenitors that earlier studies of the JJEM did not study, and examine the angular momentum parameter j=rVconv, where r is the radius of the layer and Vconv is the convective velocity according to the mixing length theory. In all models, there is at least one prominent convective zone with j>2e15 cm^2/s inside the mass coordinate that is the maximum baryonic mass of a neutron star (NS), m=2.65 Mo. According to the JJEM, convection in these zones seeds instabilities above the newly born NS, leading to the formation of intermittent accretion disks that launch pairs of jittering jets, which in turn explode the star. Our finding is encouraging for the JJEM, although it does not show that the intermittent accretion disks indeed form. We strengthen the claim that, according to the JJEM, there are no failed CCSNe and that all massive stars explode. In demonstrating the robust convection in the inner core of stripped-envelope CCSN progenitors, we add to the establishment of the JJEM as the primary explosion mechanism of CCSNe.

 - **Abstract**
 The Milky Way's inner region is dominated by a stellar bar and a boxy-peanut shaped bulge. However, which stellar populations inhabit the inner Galaxy or how star formation proceeded there is still unknown. The difficulty in studying these stars stems from their location in dense regions that are strongly impacted by extinction and crowding effects. In this work, we use star formation histories computed in the solar neighbourhood using Gaia Colour-Magnitude Diagram fitting to shed light onto the evolution of the central regions of our Galaxy. For that, we have obtained precise age distributions for the non-negligible amount of super metal-rich stars ([M/H] $\sim$ 0.5) in the solar neighbourhood (more than 5$\%$ of the total stars within 400 pc of the plane). Assuming that these stars were born in the inner Galaxy and migrated outwards, those distributions should be indicative of the true stellar age distribution in the inner Galaxy. Surprisingly, we find that these age distributions are not continuous but show clear signs of episodic star formation ($\sim$~13.5, 10.0, 7.0, 4.0, 2.0 and less than 1~Gyr ago). Interestingly, with the exception of the 4~Gyr event, the timings of the detected events coincide with the formation of the primitive Milky Way and with known merging events or satellite encounters (Gaia-Enceladus-Sausage, Sagittarius dwarf galaxy, and the Magellanic Clouds), suggesting that these could have induced enhanced and global star-forming episodes. These results are compatible with a scenario in which Gaia-Enceladus-Sausage is responsible for the formation of the bar 10 Gyr ago. However, we cannot associate any accretion counterpart with the 4-Gyr-ago event, leaving room for a late formation of the bar, as previously proposed. A qualitative comparison with the Auriga Superstars simulations suggesting a possible link to bar dynamics and satellite accretion. [Abridged]

 - **Abstract**
 Young planetary-mass objects and brown dwarfs near the L/T spectral transition exhibit enhanced spectrophotometric variability over field brown dwarfs. Patchy clouds, auroral processes, stratospheric hot spots, and complex carbon chemistry have all been proposed as potential sources of this variability. Using time-resolved, low-to-mid-resolution spectroscopy collected with the JWST/NIRISS and NIRSpec instruments, we apply harmonic analysis to SIMP J0136, a highly variable, young, isolated planetary-mass object. Odd harmonics (k=3) at pressure levels (> 1 bar) corresponding to iron and forsterite cloud formation suggest North/South hemispheric asymmetry in the cloudy, and likely equatorial, regions. We use the inferred harmonics, along with 1-D substellar atmospheric models, to map the flux variability by atmospheric pressure level. These vertical maps demonstrate robust interaction between deep convective weather layers and the overlying stratified and radiative atmosphere. We identify distinct time-varying structures in the near-infrared that we interpret as planetary-scale wave (e.g., Rossby or Kelvin)-associated cloud modulation. We detect variability in water (S/N = 14.0), carbon monoxide (S/N = 13.0), and methane (S/N = 14.9) molecular signatures. Forsterite cloud modulation is anti-correlated with overlying carbon monoxide and water abundances and correlated with deep methane absorption, suggesting complex interaction between cloud formation, atmospheric chemistry, and temperature structure. Furthermore, we identify distinct harmonic behavior between methane and carbon monoxide absorption bands, providing evidence for time-resolved disequilibrium carbon chemistry. At the lowest pressures (< 100 mbar), we find that the mapped methane lines transition from absorption to emission, supporting evidence of high-altitude auroral heating via electron precipitation.

 - **Abstract**
 The ADF22 line survey reported detections of two high-$z$ line-emitting source candidates above 6-$\sigma$, both of which were shown to be spurious after follow-up observations. We investigate the detectability of far-infrared emitters in ALMA deep fields using mock observations by injecting artificial line-emitting sources into the visibility planes. We also discuss our investigation, conducted together with the ALMA operations team, of a possible technical problem in the original observations. Finally, we devise a method to estimate the [CII] luminosity function (LF) at $z \sim 6$, including a full analysis of signal contamination and sample completeness. The comparison of pixel distributions between the real and mock datacubes does not show significant differences, confirming that the effect of non-Gaussian noise is negligible for the ADF22 datacube. Using 100 blank mock-mosaic datasets, we show 0.43 $\pm$ 0.67 false detections per datacube with the previous source-finding method. We argue that the underestimation of the contamination rate in the previous work is caused by the smaller number of datacubes, using only 4 real ADF22 datacubes. We compare the results of clump-finding between the time division mode and frequency division mode correlator datacubes and confirm that the velocity widths of the clumps in the TDM case are up to 3 times wider than in the FDM case. The LF estimation using our model shows that a correction for the number count is required, up to one order of magnitude, in the luminosity range of $\geq 5 \times 10^8 L_\odot$. Our reconstruction method for the line LF can be applied to future blind line surveys.

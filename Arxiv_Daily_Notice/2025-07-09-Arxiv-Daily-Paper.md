 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the use of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Decomposition-LSTM (DLSTM) networks, combined with an ensemble algorithm, to predict solar flare occurrences using time-series data from the GOES catalog. The dataset spans from 2003 to 2023 and includes 151,071 flare events. Among approximately possible patterns, 7,552 yearly pattern windows are identified, highlighting the challenge of long-term forecasting due to the Sun's complex, self-organized criticality-driven behavior. A sliding window technique is employed to detect temporal quasi-patterns in both irregular and regularized flare time series. Regularization reduces complexity, enhances large flare activity, and captures active days more effectively. To address class imbalance, resampling methods are applied. LSTM and DLSTM models are trained on sequences of peak fluxes and waiting times from irregular time series, while LSTM and DLSTM, integrated with an ensemble approach, are applied to sliding windows of regularized time series with a 3-hour interval. Performance metrics, particularly TSS (0.74), recall (0.95) and the area under the curve (AUC=0.87) in the receiver operating characteristic (ROC), indicate that DLSTM with an ensemble approach on regularized time series outperforms other models, offering more accurate large-flare forecasts with fewer false errors compared to models trained on irregular time series. The superior performance of DLSTM is attributed to its ability to decompose time series into trend and seasonal components, effectively isolating random noise. This study underscores the potential of advanced machine learning techniques for solar flare prediction and highlights the importance of incorporating various solar cycle phases and resampling strategies to enhance forecasting reliability.

 - **Abstract**
 Ultramassive white dwarfs (UMWDs; defined by masses $\gtrsim 1.1\,{\rm M}_\odot$) are prime targets for seismology, because they pass through the ZZ Ceti instability strip at the same time that their cores crystallize. Recent studies suggest that crystallization may magnetize white dwarf interiors with a strong magnetic field $B_0$ up to a radius $r_{\rm out}^0$, either through a magnetic dynamo or by transporting a pre-existing fossil field. We demonstrate that seismology can probe these buried fields before they break out at the surface, because even the weak exponential tail of the outwardly diffusing field can disrupt the propagation of gravity waves near the surface. Based on the observed oscillation modes of WD J0135+5722 - the richest pulsating UMWD to date - we constrain its surface field $B_{\rm surf}\lesssim 2\,\textrm{kG}$. We solve the induction equation and translate this to an upper limit on the internal field $B_0$. For a carbon-oxygen (CO) core we find $B_{\rm surf}\ll B_0\lesssim 0.6\,\textrm{MG}$, consistent with the crystallization dynamo theory. For an oxygen-neon (ONe) core, on the the other hand, $r_{\rm out}^0$ is larger, such that the magnetic field breaks out and $B_{\rm surf}\lesssim B_0\lesssim 7\,\textrm{kG}$. This low magnetic field rules out an ONe composition or, alternatively, an intense dynamo during crystallization or merger. Either way, the imprint of magnetic fields on UMWD seismology may reveal the uncertain composition and formation paths of these stars.

 - **Abstract**
 Integral field spectroscopy (IFS) offers a distinct advantage for studying extended sources by enabling spatially resolved emission maps for several emission lines without the need for specific filters. This study conducts a detailed analysis of iron and nickel emission lines in 12 planetary nebulae (PNe) using integral field unit (IFU) data from MUSE to provide insights into their formation and evolution mechanisms. New diagnostic line ratios, combined with machine-learning algorithms, were used to distinguish excitation mechanisms such as shock and photoionization. Electron densities and elemental abundances were estimated using different atomic data through the PyNeb package. The contribution of fluorescent excitation of nickel lines was also examined. A total of 16 iron- and nickel-rich clumps are detected in seven out of 12 PNe. New clumps are discovered in NGC 3132 and IC 4406. The most prominent lines are [Fe II] 8617 Angstrom and [Ni II] 7378 Angstrom. Both emission lines are observed emanating directly from the low-ionization structures (LIS) of NGC 3242, NGC 7009, and NGC 6153, as well as from clumps in NGC 6369 and Tc 1. Their abundances are found to be below solar values, indicating that a fraction of Fe and Ni remains depleted in dust grains. The depletion factors exhibit a strong correlation over a wide range. A machine-learning approach allows us to classify ten out of 16 clumps as shock-excited and to establish a new shock/photoionization selection criterion: log([Ni II] 7378 Angstrom / H-alpha) and log([Fe II] 8617 Angstrom / H-alpha) greater than -2.20.

 - **Abstract**
 WD-1856b+534b (WD-1856b) is to date the only detected cold Jupiter outside of our Solar System. This cold Jupiter can provide useful information about the cold giants in our Solar System. Recent JWST observations have targeted WD-1856b, with more scheduled in the near future. To support the interpretation of these observations, we simulated WD-1856b using a three-dimensional (3D) General Circulation Model (GCM) and produced synthetic emission spectra of the planet. We used the Exo-FMS GCM with correlated-k radiative transfer (RT) and mixing-length theory (MLT). In addition, we included abundances of 13 chemical species using the thermochemical kinetic model mini-chem. Because there are substantial uncertainties in the metallicity and internal temperature of WD-1856b, we ran simulations with 1x, 10x, and 100x solar compositions and at low and high internal temperatures (100 K and 500 K). We generated emission spectra and brightness temperature curves with the GCM output using the 3D Monte Carlo radiative-transfer code gCMCRT. Our results suggest larger volume mixing ratios (VMR) of CO and \CO2 with a warmer core at higher metallicity. With a colder core, H2O and CH4 become more relevant and increase to 0.01 VMR at 100x Solar. We suggest possible \H2O cloud formation in the upper atmosphere in the warm 100x solar case and in all cold cases, which may reduce gas phase H2O in the upper atmosphere moderately.

 - **Abstract**
 The dynamical stability of differentially rotating neutron stars, including hypermassive neutron stars, is of paramount importance in understanding the fate of the post-merger remnant of binary neutron stars mergers and the formation of a black hole during core collapse supernovae. We study systematically the dynamical stability of differentially rotating neutron stars within a broad range of masses, rotation rates and degrees of differential rotation, modeled as polytropes with $\Gamma=2$. We pay particular attention to quasi-toroidal configurations that are outside the parameter space region explored in previous works. We estimate the limits of the region of stability against quasi-radial perturbations by performing an extensive set of numerical simulations. We find that some of the stability criteria proposed in the past are not sufficient nor necessary to determine stability if differential rotation is present and propose a new more general criterion. We show that there is a large parameter space that allows for quasi-toroidal configurations that will not collapse immediately to a black hole and that can sustain masses up to $\sim 2.5$ times the maximum mass of a non-rotating neutron star.
#### Is Earendel a Star Cluster?: Metal Poor Globular Cluster Progenitors at $z\sim6$

 - **Abstract**
 The strongly-lensed $z\sim 6$ Sunrise galaxy offers an incredible opportunity to investigate star formation in the early universe on parsec or smaller scales. The highly magnified object Earendel within the Sunrise was previously identified as a candidate star or binary due to size constraints placed by the lensing magnification, however recent works have suggested this constraint may be relaxed to even the size of star clusters. Here, we explore the hypothesis that Earendel may actually be a star cluster, and simultaneously evaluate other star clusters within the host galaxy. Leveraging deep, archival James Webb Space Telescope NIRSpec PRISM spectroscopy, we determine a spectroscopic redshift for the Sunrise galaxy $z=5.926 \pm 0.013$, and we fit simple stellar population (SSP) models from three premier libraries to evaluate the physical parameters of Earendel and another distinct star cluster in the Sunrise dubbed `$1b$'. We find the rest-UV through optical continuum of Earendel to be well-described by an SSP, nearly equivalently to $1b$ which is confidently a star cluster. We infer they have intermediate ages $t_{\rm age}\sim 30$--$150\,$Myr, are metal poor ($Z_\star\lesssim10\%\,Z_\odot$), and are consistent with the formation age-metallicity trend seen in local globular clusters. Such intermediate age clusters are seldom probed spectroscopically in the high redshift universe, and we explore the extent to which these clusters can be characterized via the spectroscopic continuum.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding the optical properties of exoplanet cloud particles is a top priority. Many cloud condensates form as nonspherical particles and their optical properties can be very different from those of spheres. In this study, we focus on KCl particles, which likely form as cuboids in warm (T=500-1000K) exoplanet atmospheres. We compare the phase functions (at 532 nm wavelength) of KCl particles computed with Mie theory, the two-term Henyey-Greenstein (TTHG) approximation, laboratory data, and the discrete dipole approximation (DDA). Mie theory assumes scattering from spheres, while TTHG functions are used to approximate cloud scattering in two-stream radiative transfer models like PICASO. Laboratory measurements and DDA allow for a robust understanding of scattering from cuboid and deformed cuboid particle shapes. We input these phase functions into PICASO using cloud distributions from the cloud model Virga, to determine how different phase functions can impact the reflected-light intensities of the benchmark sub-Neptune, GJ 1214b. Simulated reflected light phase curves of GJ1214b produced using the TTHG, laboratory, and DDA phase curves differ by less than 3ppm. Our findings suggest that TTHG phase functions may be useful for approximating the scattering intensity of certain cuboid and irregular particle shapes. Future work should expand upon the wavelengths and particles considered to better determine when scattering approximations, like TTHG, may be useful in lieu of more accurate, but time-consuming laboratory measurements and/or nonspherical scattering theory.

 - **Abstract**
 Ultra-stripped supernovae are core-collapse supernovae from progenitors that lose a significant fraction of mass because of the binary interactions with their compact companion stars. Ultra-stripped supernovae have been connected to fast-evolving faint Type Ib or Ic supernovae. Here, we show that in some cases ultra-stripped supernovae can result in Type Ibn supernovae. Progenitors of ultra-stripped supernovae may trigger violent silicon burning shortly before the core collapse, leading to mass ejection that results in a dense circumstellar matter. By taking an ultra-stripped supernova progenitor that loses 0.2 Msun at 78 days before the core collapse, we compute the light-curve evolution of the ultra-stripped supernova within the dense circumstellar matter. The core collapse results in a supernova explosion with an ejecta mass of 0.06 Msun and an explosion energy of 9e49 erg. Because the dense circumstellar matter is more massive than the supernova ejecta, the ejecta are immediately decelerated and the light curve is powered mainly by the circumstellar interaction. Therefore, this ultra-stripped supernova is likely observed as a Type Ibn supernova. We suggest that some Type Ibn supernovae may originate from ultra-stripped supernova progenitors losing significant mass shortly before their explosion due to violent silicon burning.
#### A Comprehensive Look at PUDG-R21: Stellar Population and Kinematics of a Globular Cluster-Rich Ultra-Diffuse Galaxy in the Perseus Cluster

 - **Abstract**
 We present the analysis of the stellar populations and kinematics of the globular cluster (GC) rich ultra-diffuse galaxy, PUDG-R21, using spectroscopic observations obtained with the Keck Cosmic Web Imager (KCWI). The recessional velocity is measured to be 5536$\pm$10 km s$^{\mathrm{-1}}$, confirming its association with the Perseus cluster. The galaxy exhibits mild rotation of 15.6$\pm$10 km s$^{\mathrm{-1}}$ and a stellar velocity dispersion of 19.4$\pm$3.5 km s$^{\mathrm{-1}}$ within the galaxy effective radius. From this, we infer a dynamical mass of M$_{\mathrm{dyn}}=9.3\pm3.3\times10^{8}$ M$_{\odot}$. Based on a halo mass derived from PUDG-R21 GC counts, we find our dynamical mass is consistent with a cored dark matter profile. The integrated stellar population analysis reveals a predominantly old stellar population of 10.4$\pm$1.2 Gyr, with intermediate-low metallicity ([M/H]=-0.64$\pm$0.12 dex) and elevated alpha abundances ([Mg/Fe]=0.38$\pm$0.25 dex). The inferred star formation history suggests rapid stellar assembly, likely truncating prior to or during the galaxy's infall into the cluster at an early epoch ($\sim$10 Gyr ago). The analysis of stellar population gradients (age and metallicity) indicates a flat profile out to one effective radius. Here, we consider the involvement of two star formation events, initially forming a large population of metal-poor globular clusters, and then the latter contributing to the more metal-enriched diffuse stellar body. The evidence of subsequent star formation suggests this galaxy is more like an extension of the classical dwarf population than the much discussed failed galaxy UDGs.

 - **Abstract**
 We present 0.3-21mic observations at ~275d and ~400d for Type II supernova (SN) 2024ggi, combining ground-based optical and near-infrared data from the Keck I/II telescopes and space-based infrared data from the James Webb Space Telescope. Although the optical regions dominate the observed flux, SN2024ggi is bright at infrared wavelengths (65%/35% falls each side of 1mic). SN2024ggi exhibits a plethora of emission lines from H, He, intermediate-mass elements (O, Na, Mg, S, Ar, Ca), and iron-group elements (IGEs; Fe, Co, and Ni) -- all lines have essentially the same width, suggesting efficient macroscopic chemical mixing of the inner ejecta at <~2000km/s and little mixing of 56Ni at larger velocities. Molecular emission in the infrared range is dominated by the CO fundamental, which radiates about 5% of the total SN luminosity. A molecule-free radiative-transfer model based on a standard red-supergiant star explosion (i.e., ~1e51erg, 0.06Msun of 56Ni from a 15.2Msun progenitor) yields a satisfactory match throughout the optical and infrared at both epochs. The SN2024ggi CO luminosity is comparable to the fractional decay-power absorbed in the model C/O-rich shell -- accounting for CO cooling would likely resolve the model overestimate of the [OI]0.632mic flux. The relative weakness of the molecular emission in SN2024ggi and the good overall match obtained with our molecule-free model suggests negligible microscopic mixing -- about 95% of the SN luminosity is radiated by atoms and ions. Lines from IGEs, which form from explosion ashes at such late times, are ideal diagnostics of the magnitude of 56Ni mixing in core-collapse SN ejecta. Stable Ni, clearly identified in SN2024ggi (e.g., [NiII]6.634mic), is probably a common product of massive-star explosions.

 - **Abstract**
 Determining the amount of sulfur in volatiles and refractories in the ISM remains one of the main problems in astrochemistry. The detection of H$_2$S ices, which are thought to be one of the main sulfur reservoirs, has not been achieved yet, and the only S-bearing species detected in the ices to date is OCS. PRODIGE large survey observations with NOEMA of several Class 0/I protostars in the Perseus Molecular Cloud provide a perfect opportunity to study the H$_2$S and OCS composition of the ices through the volatiles sublimated in the warm inner core (T$>$100K, n $\sim10^6$cm$^{-3}$) of these protostars. Our aim is to determine the H$_2$S/OCS ratio in the warm inner core of 24 protostars in order to study how it is affected by different factors during its evolution. We used the NOEMA millimeter observations from the PRODIGE program of H$_2$S, H$_2^{33}$S, OCS, OC$^{33}$S and OC$^{34}$S to estimate the H$_2$S and OCS column densities in the warm inner cores. We used SO and SO$_2$ data from the ALMA archive to give a rough estimate of the total sulfur abundance. We explore the chemistry of H$_2$S and OCS in the warm cores using chemical and dynamical simulations of the collapse of a dense core to form a protostar. The estimated H$_2$S/OCS ratio reveals a segregation of the sources into ``OCS-poor'' and ``OCS-rich'' protostars, where the OCS-poor protostars present higher H$_2$S/OCS ratios than the OCS-rich ones. Total sulfur abundance is always dominated by either H$_2$S or OCS, grows with evolution during the Class 0 phase up to $D_S<8$, and decreases again in the Class I. Simulations show that temperature changes in the pre-stellar phase and during the collapse can produce substantial differences in the H$_2$S and OCS abundances and in the H$_2$S/OCS ratio. Our analysis shows that the H$_2$S/OCS ratio is strongly influenced by the environment and the initial conditions of the cloud.
#### PDRs4All XV. Tracing AIB characteristics in PDR spectra with PAHFIT in the JWST era

 - **Abstract**
 Photodissociation regions (PDRs) exhibit emission between 3-20 um known as the Aromatic Infrared Bands (AIBs), originating from small carbonaceous species such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). The AIB spectra observed in Galactic PDRs, such as the Orion Bar observations by the PDRs4All JWST program, are considered a local analog for those seen in extragalactic star-forming regions. We present the Python version of PAHFIT, a spectral decomposition tool that separates the contributions by AIB subcomponents, thermal dust emission, gas lines, stellar light, and dust extinction. By fitting segments of the Orion Bar spectra, we provide a configuration to decompose JWST spectra of PDRs in detail. The resulting central wavelengths and FWHM of the AIB subcomponents are compiled into a "PDR pack" for PAHFIT. We applied PAHFIT with this PDR pack and the default continuum model to spectra of the central star forming ring of the galaxy NGC7469. We introduce an alternate dust continuum model to fit the Orion Bar spectra, as the default PAHFIT continuum model mismatches the intensity at 15-26 um. PAHFIT fits with the PDR pack and the alternate continuum model reproduce the Orion Bar spectra with residuals of a few percent, and similar performance is achieved for the NGC7469 spectra. We provide PAHFIT-based diagnostics that trace the profile variations of the 3.3, 3.4, 5.7, 6.2, and 7.7 um AIBs, and thus the photochemical evolution of the AIB carriers. The 5.7 um AIB emission originates from at least two subpopulations, one more prominent in highly irradiated environments and one preferring more shielded environments. Smaller PAHs as well as very small grains or PAH clusters both thrive in the more shielded environments of the molecular zone in the Orion Bar. Based on these new diagnostics, we quantify the similarities between the AIB profiles observed in the Orion Bar and NGC7469.
#### Comment on "Discovery and Preliminary Characterization of a Third Interstellar Object: 3I/ATLAS" [arXiv:2507.02757]

 - **Abstract**
 The interstellar object 3I/ATLAS shows a weak cometary activity. Its brightness suggests a maximum radius of ~10km (A/0.05)^{-1/2} for an asteroid with an albedo A. I show that interstellar objects with that radius would amount to an interstellar mass density that is well above the expected mass budget of interstellar comets or asteroids. Given this budget, the detection rate of objects like 3I/ATLAS implies that it is a comet with a small core radius <0.6km, or a member of a rare population with a number density <5x10^{-8}au^{-3}} for R<10km. The second possibility would suggest that the rare population of 3I/ATLAS objects favors plunging orbits towards the inner solar system to accommodate their inferred detection rate.

 - **Abstract**
 The diffuse Galactic neutrino flux is produced by cosmic rays interacting with the interstellar medium. The measurement of this flux can help to understand the distribution of cosmic rays in the Galaxy. The first observation of this neutrino flux was published in 2023 by the IceCube Collaboration. Here, plans for a new analysis combining different event topologies are presented. IceCube measures events in two main topologies. Tracks, originating in charged current $\nu_\mu$ interactions, provide a better angular resolution. In contrast, cascades, from most other possible interactions, provide a better energy resolution and are able to observe the Southern sky (and therefore the Galactic Center) despite the huge background of atmospheric muons. Combining both event topologies in one analysis exploits all these advantages. Sensitivities and model discrimination power of a combined measurement using a forward folding binned likelihood fit are discussed here.

 - **Abstract**
 We conduct a model atmosphere analysis on all magnetic white dwarfs in the SDSS 100 pc sample. We have 163 magnetic targets in this sample, 87 of which are new discoveries, making this the largest volume-limited survey of magnetic white dwarfs to date. We discuss the distribution of multiple parameters, including mass, cooling age, and field strength. We find strong evidence of two populations of magnetic white dwarfs that form through separate mechanisms based on a cluster analysis of these parameters. The young, high mass objects typically have high field strengths which indicate a merger origin, while old, average mass objects have weaker fields that likely originated through a crystallization-induced dynamo or previous evolution stages. When comparing young and old objects, two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests yield statistically significant differences between the field strengths and masses of the magnetic targets. We use a Gaussian mixture model to identify where these populations lie in parameter space, and we find two groups centered at distinct cooling ages, masses, and field strengths: 2.9 Gyr, 0.71 $M_{\odot}$, 3.7 MG and 1.8 Gyr, 0.96 $M_{\odot}$, 84 MG respectively. Our results further support the dual formation channel previously reported in the literature. The occurrence of magnetism strongly correlates with the onset of crystallization. However, given the breakout times required for a crystallization dynamo, we find that many of our older, average mass objects can be better explained with a core-convective dynamo that forms on the main-sequence.

 - **Abstract**
 In recent decades, significant attention has been dedicated to analytical and observational studies of the atomic hydrogen (HI) to molecular hydrogen (H2) transition in the interstellar medium. We focussed on the Draco diffuse cloud to gain deeper insights into the physical properties of the transition from HI to H2. We employed the total hydrogen column density probability distribution function (N-PDF) derived from Herschel dust observations and the N(HI)-PDF obtained from HI data collected by the Effelsberg HI survey. The N-PDF of the Draco cloud exhibits a double-log-normal distribution, whereas the N(HI)-PDF follows a single log-normal distribution. The HI-to-H2 transition is identified as the point where the two log-normal components of the dust N-PDF contribute equally; it occurs at Av = 0.33 (N=6.2e20 cm^-2). The low-column-density segment of the dust N-PDF corresponds to the cold neutral medium, which is characterized by a temperature of around 100 K. The higher-column-density part is predominantly associated with H2. The shape of the Draco N-PDF is qualitatively reproduced by numerical simulations. In the absence of substantial stellar feedback, such as radiation or stellar winds, turbulence exerts a significant influence on the thermal stability of the gas and can regulate the condensation of gas into denser regions and its subsequent evaporation. Recent observations of the ionized carbon line at 158 micron in Draco support this scenario. Using the KOSMA-tau photodissociation model, we estimate a gas density of n=50 cm^-3 and a temperature of 100 K at the location of the HI-to-H2 transition. Both the molecular and atomic gas components are characterized by supersonic turbulence and strong mixing, suggesting that simplified steady-state chemical models are not applicable under these conditions.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first experimental evidence for in-ice radiofrequency emission from high-energy particle cascades developing in the Antarctic ice sheet. In 208 days of data recorded with the phased-array trigger of the Askaryan Radio Array, we detect 13 events with impulsive radiofrequency pulses originating from below the ice surface. Considering only the arrival angles and timing properties, this rate is inconsistent with an a-posteriori background expectation for thermal noise events and on-surface events at the level of 3.5$\,\sigma$, which rises to 5.1$\,\sigma$ when additionally considering impulsivity. The observed event geometry, event rate, signal shape, spectral content, and electric field polarization are consistent with Askaryan radiation from cosmic ray air shower cores impacting the ice sheet. For the brightest events, the angular radiation pattern independently favors an extended cascade-like emitter over a pointlike source.

 - **Abstract**
 Hydrogen, helium, silicates, and iron are key building blocks of rocky and gas-rich planets, yet their chemical interactions remain poorly constrained. Using first-principles molecular dynamics and thermodynamic integration, we quantify hydrogen and helium partitioning between molten silicate mantles and metallic cores for Earth-to-Neptune-mass planets. Hydrogen becomes strongly siderophilic above $\sim$25 GPa but weakens beyond $\sim$200 GPa, whereas helium remains lithophilic yet increasingly soluble in metal with pressure. Incorporating these trends into coupled structure-chemistry models suggests that majority of hydrogen and helium reside in planetary interiors, not atmospheres, with abundances strongly depending on planet mass. Such volatile exchange may influence the redox states of secondary atmospheres, longevity of primordial envelopes, predicted CHNOPS abundances, and emergence of helium-enriched atmospheres, while He 1083 nm and H Lyman-$\alpha$ lines provide potential probes of atmosphere-interior exchange. These findings link atomic-scale interactions to planetary-scale observables, providing new constraints on the origins of Earth-to-Neptune-sized worlds.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first high-resolution X-ray spectrum of NGC 7213 obtained with XRISM/Resolve, supported by simultaneous XMM-Newton, NuSTAR, and SOAR optical data. The XRISM spectrum resolves the neutral Fe\,K$\alpha$ into two components: a narrow core ($\rm FWHM = 650_{-220}^{+240}\,\rm km\,s^{-1}$) consistent with emission at the dust sublimation radius, and a broader, asymmetric line best described by disk-like emission from $\sim 100\,\rm R_{g}$. This disk component mirrors the profile of the double-peaked H$\alpha$ line observed in the optical. In addition, we detect broadened Fe XXV and Fe XXVI emission lines whose inferred locations bridge the gap between the inner disk and the optical broad-line region. The weak narrow Fe K$\alpha$ equivalent width ($\rm EW = 32 \pm 6\,eV$) and absence of a Compton hump imply a low-covering-fraction, Compton-thin torus. Together, these results reveal a radially stratified structure in NGC 7213, spanning nearly four orders of magnitude in radius, and place the source in an intermediate accretion state ($\rm \lambda_{Edd} = 0.001-0.01$) where the inner disk and BLR remain, while the torus shows signs of dissipation.
#### Physical properties of long-rising type II Supernovae -- Bayesian Analytic Modelling and Spectrophotometric Correlations

 - **Abstract**
 Supernova (SN) 1987A, with its long-rising ($\gtrsim$40~days) light curve, defines a rare subclass of type II SNe known as 1987A-like events. Representing only $\sim$1-3\% of all core-collapse SNe and often found in low-metallicity environments, their large diversity suggests a wide range of progenitor and explosion properties. This study aims to improve the understanding of 1987A-like SNe by characterizing their explosion parameters, including kinetic energy, ejected mass, progenitor radius at explosion, and synthesized $^{56}$Ni mass. Additionally, it seeks to identify systematic trends in both the physical properties and the observed features of these peculiar events. A new Bayesian parameter estimation method, based on our $^{56}$Ni-dependent analytical model for hydrogen-rich SNe, is applied to derive explosion parameters from the light curves and expansion velocities of one of the largest and most comprehensive 1987A-like SN samples to date. These data are measured through a consistent analysis of observations available in the literature. The analysis reveals a heterogeneous population that nevertheless clusters into two main groups: (i) lower-energy explosions with modest $^{56}$Ni yields ($\sim$0.07~M$_\odot$), similar to SN~1987A, and (ii) more energetic events (up to $\sim$5~foe) with larger nickel production and, in some cases, unusually extended progenitors. We confirm a robust correlation between $^{56}$Ni mass, peak luminosity, and explosion energy, as well as between ejecta mass and recombination timescale. An anti-correlation between Ba~II line strength and photospheric velocity indicates that stronger Ba~II absorptions in 1987A-like SNe arise from more compact, slowly expanding ejecta. Our study underscores the need to extend analytical frameworks to include additional power sources, enabling scalable and accurate modelling of the growing number of peculiar transients.
#### Numerical Studies on the Radio Afterglows in TDE: Bow Shock

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.25033

 - **Abstract**
 The origin of radio afterglows or delayed radio flares in tidal disruption events (TDEs) is not fully understood. They could be generated either by a forward shock (FS) propagating into diffuse circumnuclear medium (CNM), or a bow shock (BS) around a dense cloud, each of which is fundamentally different. To elucidate the distinctions between these two scenarios, we conducted two-fluid simulations incorporating relativistic electrons to investigate the spatial evolution of these electrons after being accelerated by shock. Based on their spatial distribution, we performed radiative transfer calculations to obtain the synchrotron spectra. In Paper I (Mou 2025), we reported the results for the FS scenario; in this article, we focus on the BS scenario. Compared to that from the FS, the radio emission from the BS exhibits a higher peak frequency, and its flux shows a much steeper rise and a more rapid decline. The radio flux from the BS also responds to fluctuations in the outflow. The combined effects of the BS and FS substantially alter radio spectra, causing significant deviations from the single-zone emission model, and in some cases producing double-peaked or flat-top features in spectra. This study highlights the importance of the BS, and inspires a novel approach for probing dense gas on sub-parsec scales in galactic nuclei by decomposing the BS radio spectrum to reveal the conditions of circumnuclear dense gas.
#### Magnetic Fields in Massive Star-forming Regions (MagMaR). VI. Magnetic Field Dragging in the Filamentary High-mass Star-forming Region G35.20--0.74N due to Gravity

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the magnetic field orientation and strength in the massive star-forming region G35.20-0.74N (G35), using polarized dust emission data obtained with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) as part of the Magnetic fields in Massive star-forming Regions (MagMaR) survey. The G35 region shows a filamentary structure (a length of $\sim$0.1 pc) with six bright cores located along the filament's long axis. Magnetic field strengths across the G35 region range from 0.2 to 4.4 mG with a mean value of 0.8 $\pm$ 0.4 mG. The mass-to-flux ratio ($\lambda$) varies from 0.1 to 6.0 the critical value. The highest values are found locally around cores, whereas the remains of the filament are subcritical. A H$^{13}$CO$^+$ (3--2) velocity gradient of 29 km s$^{-1}$ pc$^{-1}$ is evident along the filament's long axis, aligned with the magnetic field direction. At larger scales ($\sim$0.1 pc), the magnetic field lines appear roughly perpendicular to the filament's long axis, in contrast to the smaller-scale structure ($\sim$0.003 pc) traced by ALMA. The magnetic field lines could be dragged along the filament as a result of the gas motion induced by the gravitational potential of the filament. Six cores in the filament have similar spacings between 0.02--0.04 pc. The initial filament fragmentation could have produced a core spacing of 0.06 pc, following filament fragmentation theory, and the current core spacing is the result of cores comoving with the gas along the filament. This core migration could occur in a few 10$^4$ years, consistent with high-mass star formation time scales.

 - **Abstract**
 Observational studies of HII region-molecular cloud interactions constrain models of feedback and quantify its impact on the surrounding environment. A recent hypothesis proposes that a characteristic spectral signature in ground state hyperfine lines of hydroxyl (OH) -- the OH flip -- may trace gas that is dynamically interacting with an expanding HII region, offering a new means of probing such interactions. We explore this hypothesis using dedicated Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) observations of three Galactic HII regions, G049.205$-$0.343, G034.256+0.145 and G024.471+0.492, in 1--2 GHz continuum emission, all four 18-cm ground-state OH lines, and multiple hydrogen radio recombination lines. A Gaussian decomposition of the molecular gas data reveals complex OH emission and absorption across our targets. We detect the OH flip towards two of our sources, G049.205$-$0.343 and G034.256+0.145, finding agreement between key predictions of flip hypothesis and the observed multi-wavelength spectra, kinematics and morphology. Specifically, we demonstrate a strong spatial and kinematic association between the OH flip and the ionized gas of the HII regions -- the first time this has been demonstrated for resolved sources -- and evidence from $^{13}$CO(1--0) data that the expected OH component originates from the non-disturbed gas of the parent cloud. While we detect no flip in G024.471+0.492, we do find evidence of interacting molecular gas traced by OH, providing further support for OH's ability to trace HII region-molecular cloud interactions.
#### Probing the Physical and Chemical Characteristics of an Extremely Early Class 0 Protostar in G204.4-11.3A2-NE

 - **Abstract**
 We have observed the low-mass molecular cloud core G204.4-11.3A2-NE (G204NE) in the direction of Orion B giant molecular cloud with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array in Band 6. The $\rm 1.3\ mm$ continuum images and visibilities unveil a compact central structure with a radius of $\sim$12 au, while showing no signature of binarity down to 18 au. The bolometric temperature and luminosity of this source are derived to be ${\sim}$33 K and $\sim$1.15 $~L_{\odot}$, respectively. Chemical stratification is observed in dense gas tracers, with C$^{18}$O emission peaking at the continuum position surrounded by the spatially extended emission of N$_2$D$^+$ and DCO$^+$. This implies that the core is in a very early evolutionary stage in which $\rm CO$ depletion occurs in most regions except for a small area heated by the central source. The envelope kinematics indicates a rotating and infalling structure with a central protostar mass of 0.08-0.1 $M_{\odot}$. The protostar drives a collimated outflow traced by CO, SiO, SO, and H$_2$CO, with misaligned blueshifted and redshifted lobes exhibiting a pair of bow-like patterns. High-velocity jets, extending up to 720 au, are detected in CO, SiO, and SO lines. The jet launching region is likely within twice of the dust sublimation zone. The absence of a binary signature suggests the outflows and jets are driven by a single protostar, although a close binary cannot be ruled out. The observed deflection of the outflows and jet is likely due to turbulent accretion in a moderately magnetized core.
#### A Dual-Resolution Prescription in the $S_N$ Method for Boltzmann Neutrino Transport I: Proof of Principle and the Resolution of Collision Term

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.25274

 - **Abstract**
 We propose a dual-resolution prescription meant for the Boltzmann neutrino transport, in which the advection and collision terms are calculated with different angular resolutions in momentum space. The purpose is to address the issue of the low resolution that afflicts the $S_N$ method in the multi-dimensional neutrino transport simulations for core-collapse supernovae. We handle with a high resolution the advection term alone, assuming that the collision term does not require such high resolutions. To confirm this surmise as well as our new conversion scheme, from low- to high-angular resolutions and vice versa, we run a couple of experimental one-zone (in space) simulations. Neutrino scatterings on nucleons are considered with small recoils fully taken into account whereas the advection term is replaced by the angle- and energy-dependent source terms that are designed to mimic the results of a Boltzmann simulation, inducing the anisotropy in momentum space. For the conversion from a low-resolution distribution function to a high-resolution one, we employ a polynomial interpolations in the zenith and azimuth directions separately with the number conservation and continuity (and periodicity only in the azimuth direction). We find that this dual-resolution scheme works well and that the current angular resolution employed in the canonical supernova simulations with our Boltzmann solver or a bit better in the $\phi_\nu$ direction will be sufficient for the collision terms if they are coupled with the advection terms calculated with a high-angular resolution via this prescription.
#### Modeling multiphase plasma in the corona: prominences and rain

 - **Abstract**
 We review major achievements in our understanding of multiphase coronal plasma, where cool-dense and hot-tenuous matter coexists, brought about by advances in modeling and theory, inspired by observations. We give an overview of models that self-consistently form solar (or stellar) prominences and filaments, or (postflare) coronal rain, and clarify how these different phenomena share a common physical origin, relating radiative losses and coronal heating. While we do not fully understand the coronal heating, multi-dimensional models of solar prominence and rain formation demonstrate how thermal instability triggers condensations, and how their morphology may reveal aspects of the applied heating at play. We emphasize how the many pathways to linear instability due to combined ingredients of heat-loss, gravity, flows, and magnetic topologies are all involved in the resulting nonlinear magnetohydrodynamics. We provide some challenges to future model efforts, especially concerning prominence fine structure, internal dynamics, and their overall lifecycle.
#### Accelerating star formation of dense clumps

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.25436

 - **Abstract**
 We present a statistical framework that establishes an accelerating star formation scenario for dense clumps using ATLASGAL and ALMAGAL samples. By employing the cumulative distribution function of dust temperature as a monotonic evolutionary indicator, we linearize clump evolution into a normalized timescale, enabling direct comparison across different samples. The virial mass of clumps increases exponentially with this normalized time, revealing an accelerating buildup of star-forming gas within protoclusters. The evolution of the maximum core mass further shows that the growth timescales of protoclusters and their embedded most massive protostars are comparable, implying a self-similar acceleration of star formation from the stellar to the protocluster scale. This unified framework naturally reproduces the observed evolution of luminosity, the core mass function, the mass growth of the most massive protostars, and the dense gas star formation law on clump scales, establishing a coherent picture of accelerating star formation across scales.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the analysis of 900 ks high-resolution RGS XMM-Newton observations of the nearby Seyfert galaxy Mrk 509 with the use of a self-consistent warm absorber (WA) model. We perform a physically motivated approach to the modeling of WA as a stratified medium in constant total pressure (CTP) regime. Powerful outflows are fundamental ingredients of any active galactic nuclei (AGN) structure. They may significantly affect the cosmological environment of their host galaxy. High-resolution X-ray data are best suited for outflow's studies, and the observed absorption lines on heavy elements are evidence of the physical properties of an absorbing gas. Our models allow us to fit continuum shapes bounded together with the line profiles, which gives additional constraints on the gas structure of WA in this source. In this work, we benchmark and test the CTP model on the soft X-ray spectrum of Mrk 509. A grid of synthetic absorbed spectra was computed with the photoionization code Titan assuming that the system was under CTP. As an illuminating spectral energy distribution (SED), we used the most actual multiwavelength observations available for Mrk 509. We apply these models to the high-resolution spectrum of the WA in the Mrk 509, taking into account cold/warm/hot Galactic absorption on the way to the observer. CTP gas with $\log \xi_{0} \sim 1.9$, defined on the cloud surface, fits the data well. A higher ionization component is needed for Ne X absorption. The best-fit model is optically thin with $\log N_{\rm H }= 20.456 \pm 0.016$. The lines are non-saturated, and the CTP spectral fit aligns with previous analyses of Mrk 509 with a constant density WA. The model constrains the gas density, placing the WA cloud at 0.02 pc, consistent with the inner broad line region and the thickening region of the accretion disk.

 - **Abstract**
 The scope of this paper is focused on the question if gas is transported to dense clumps inside high-mass star-forming regions through filamentary structures on a scale of several parsecs to the sub-parsec scale. We quantify the gas flows from a scale of up to several parsecs down to the sub-parsec scale along filamentary structures. In this work the accretion flow mechanisms based on gas kinematic data in the three high-mass star-forming regions G75.78, IRAS21078+5211 and NGC7538 are studied with data obtained from the IRAM 30 m telescope. The analysis is carried out using the surface density derived from 1.2 mm continuum emission and velocity differences estimated from HCO+ and H13CO+ molecular line data.
#### Engulfment of a hot Jupiter as a possible origin of the rapid spin and internal spin misalignment of the planet-hosting red giant Kepler-56

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.25680

 - **Abstract**
 A recent asteroseismic analysis suggests that Kepler-56 -- a planet-hosting red giant -- exhibits a unique spin structure: (1) the spin axes of the core and envelope are misaligned; and (2) the envelope rotates approximately an order of magnitude faster than typical red giants. In this paper, we investigate a feasible scenario to reproduce this spin structure by estimating the amount of the angular momentum (AM) supply from the planets through the simplified calculation of the time evolution of AM. As a result, unless the tidal efficiency is extremely high, we show that the tidal interactions between the known close-in planets (Kepler-56 b and c) are insufficient to supply the AM required to accelerate Kepler-56 from the spin rate observed in typical red giants. We also show that the engulfment of a hot Jupiter can be expected to provide sufficient AM supply for the acceleration ant that the mass and orbit of the engulfed hot Jupiter are constrained by a mass of 0.5-2 Jupiter masses and an orbital period of 1-6 days. On the other hand, if Kepler 56 was already rapidly spinning before entering the RG stage and requires no acceleration, the obliquity damping by the known close-in planets can reproduce the spin structure of Kepler-56. Even in such cases, planetary engulfment during the MS stage might be involved in achieving rapid spin before the tidal alignment. These discussions demonstrate the importance of Kepler-56 as a candidate for planetary engulfment that may leave traces of its spin structure.

 - **Abstract**
 We present an investigation of quantum-corrected black hole spacetimes coupled with clouds of strings, examining two distinct theoretical models that incorporate quantum gravitational effects through different implementations of correction terms. Our study explores the geodesic structure, focusing on photon sphere properties, black hole shadows, and innermost stable circular orbits of test particles around these exotic geometries. The analysis reveals fundamental modifications to particle trajectories that distinguish quantum-corrected solutions from their classical counterparts, with observable implications for high-energy astrophysics. We investigate quasi-periodic oscillations arising from test particle motion, deriving frequency relationships that could serve as observational probes of quantum gravity effects in accreting black hole systems. Through rigorous gravitational lensing analysis using the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, we calculate weak-field deflection angles and identify distinctive signatures that enable discrimination between the two quantum correction models. The gravitational lensing study reveals opposite dependencies on quantum parameters between the models, providing unambiguous observational discriminants. Additionally, we analyze the thermodynamic properties including temperature, entropy, and heat capacity modifications, exploring topological characteristics and phase transition behavior in these quantum-corrected systems. The investigation reveals that the two models exhibit contrasting behaviors across multiple observational channels, from gravitational lensing deflection angles to quasi-periodic oscillation frequencies, providing remarkable discriminants for testing quantum gravity theories.

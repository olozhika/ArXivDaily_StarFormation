 - **Abstract**
 The Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) is an extreme star formation environment, characterized by higher density, higher turbulence, stronger orbital shear, and stronger magnetic field strength than the Solar neighborhood. Whether classical theories of star formation hold within this extreme environment is still debated. In order to assess the impact of these different conditions on the interstellar medium (ISM) and on star formation, we present radiation MHD arepo simulations of a Milky Way-type galaxy. We set up a high-resolution ($M_{\rm cell}=20$ M$_\odot$) region in a ring around the Solar radius, as well as in the barred region of the Galaxy to have a coherent comparison between the CMZ and the Solar neighborhood. Although the high densities and strong levels of turbulence influence star formation and feedback, we find that a key difference in the regulation of star formation between the two environments comes from the short orbital times and the strong shear present in the CMZ. In particular, we highlight the role of the quick dynamical decoupling of stars and gas that leads to periodic re-embedding events in the early lifetimes of radiating O stars. Young stellar associations get efficiently sheared apart such that the ISM is deprived of the compounding effect of radiation and supernovae in disrupting molecular clouds. This changes dramatically the evolution of giant molecular clouds and how feedback can regulate star formation in the CMZ. Stellar feedback is no longer directly coupled to the molecular cloud from which they formed and no strong and disruptive superbubbles can develop. Instead, the feedback rather acts as a background source of turbulence.

 - **Abstract**
 Estimating the auto power spectrum of cosmological tracers from line-intensity mapping (LIM) data is often limited by instrumental noise, residual foregrounds, and systematics. Cross-power spectra between multiple lines offer a robust alternative, mitigating noise bias and systematics. However, inferring the auto spectrum from cross-correlations relies on two key assumptions: that all tracers are linearly biased with respect to the matter density field, and that they are strongly mutually correlated. In this work, we introduce a new diagnostic statistic, \(\mathcal{Q}\), which serves as a data-driven null test of these assumptions. Constructed from combinations of cross-spectra between four distinct spectral lines, \(\mathcal{Q}\) identifies regimes where cross-spectrum-based auto-spectrum reconstruction is unbiased. We validate its behavior using both analytic toy models and simulations of LIM observables, including star formation lines ([CII], [NII], [CI],[OIII]) and the 21-cm signal. We explore a range of redshifts and instrumental configurations, incorporating noise from representative surveys. Our results demonstrate that the criterion \( \mathcal{Q} \approx 1 \) reliably selects the modes where cross-spectrum estimators are valid, while significant deviations are an indicator that the key assumptions have been violated. The \( \mathcal{Q} \) diagnostic thus provides a simple yet powerful data-driven consistency check for multi-tracer LIM analyses.
#### ClearPotential: Revealing Local Dark Matter in Three Dimensions

 - **Abstract**
 We present ClearPotential, a data-driven, three-dimensional measurement of the gravitational potential of the local Milky Way using unsupervised machine learning, without the symmetry assumptions, specific functional forms, and binning required in previous work. The potential is modeled as a neural network, optimized to solve the equilibrium collisionless Boltzmann equation for the observed phase space density of Gaia DR3 Red Clump stars within 4 kpc of the Sun. This density is obtained from data using normalizing flows, and our unsupervised solution to the Boltzmann equation automatically corrects for selection effects from crowding and the dust-driven extinction of starlight. Our fully-differentiable model of the gravitational potential allows us to map the acceleration and mass density of the Galaxy in the volume around the Sun, including in the dust-obscured disk towards the Galactic Center. We determine the dark matter density at the Solar radius to be $(0.84 \pm 0.08)\times 10^{-2}\,{M}_\odot/{\rm pc}^3$, and analyze the structure of the dark matter halo. We find strong evidence for a tilted oblate halo, weak preference for a cored inner profile, and the strongest constraints to date on a possible dark matter disk. We place a bound on the timescale of disequilibrium in the local Milky Way, and find mild evidence for disequilibrium using independent acceleration measurements from timings of binary pulsar systems. This work provides the clearest map of the local Galactic potential to date and marks an important step in the era of data-driven astrometry.

 - **Abstract**
 The connection between dense gas cores and their infant protostars is key to understanding how stars form in molecular clouds. In this paper we investigate the properties, persistence, and protostellar content of cores that would be identified by a dendrogram analysis of 1.3 mm ALMA images. We use a time series of synthetic images produced by post-processing a simulation of star formation in a massive globally collapsing clump, with polaris to calculate dust radiative transfer and CASA to generate synthetic ALMA data. Identifying sinks in the simulation with protostars, we find that most dendrogram-identified cores do not contain any protostars, with many cores being transient features associated with clumpy flow along feeder filaments. Cores with protostars generally host <4, and protostellar mass is not strongly correlated with the mass of the parent cores due to their transience and shifting boundaries. Calculating observationally-relevant intensity-weighted average temperatures for all cores, we find that even at early times the core temperature distribution spans tens of Kelvin, and its width increases with time. The 1.3 mm peak and integrated intensity of the brightest mm core do not increase monotonically as the most massive associated protostar grows, indicating it cannot be assumed that brighter mm sources host more massive protostars. Leveraging the time domain, we test observational properties that have been proposed as potential evolutionary indicators and find that only the total 1.3 mm flux density of the region, the total 1.3 mm flux density in cores, and the number of cores show strong, statistically significant correlation with time.

 - **Abstract**
 In the past decade, there has been a significant shift in astrochemistry with a renewed focus on the role of non-thermal processes on the molecular interstellar medium, in particular energetic particles (such as cosmic ray particles and fast electrons) and X-ray radiation. This has been brought about in large part due to new observations of interstellar complex organic molecules (iCOMS) in environments that would inhibit their formation, such as cold, dense gas in prestellar cores or in the highly energetic environments in galactic centers. In parallel, there has been a plethora of new laboratory investigations on the role of high-energy radiation and electrons on the chemistry of astrophysical ices, demonstrating the ability of this radiation to induce complex chemistry. In recent years, theoretical models have also begun to include newer cosmic-ray-driven processes in both the gas and ice phases. In this review, we unify aspects of the chemistry driven by X-ray radiation and energetic particles into a ``high-energy astrochemistry'', defining this term and reviewing the underlying chemical processes. We conclude by examining various laboratories where high-energy astrochemistry is at play and identify future issues to be tackled.

 - **Abstract**
 Deuterium fractionation provides a key diagnostic of the physical and chemical evolution of prestellar and protostellar cores, where it is strongly linked to CO depletion in cold, dense gas. We present the first spatially resolved maps of deuterium fraction and CO depletion in the Barnard 5 (B5) region of the Perseus molecular cloud, covering both a starless core and the protostellar core hosting the Class 0/I source IRAS 03445+3242. Using IRAM 30~m observations of N$_2$H$^+$(1--0), N$_2$D$^+$(1--0), H$^{13}$CO$^+$(1--0), and DCO$^+$(2--1), complemented by C$^{18}$O(2--1) data, we derive column density, deuterium fraction, and CO depletion maps. We find that the deuterium fraction in both mentioned nitrogen- and carbon-bearing species increases from the protostellar to the starless core, reaching $R_D^{\rm N_2H^+}=0.43\pm0.10$ and $R_D^{\rm HCO^+}=0.09\pm0.02$ in the starless core, compared with $0.15\pm0.03$ and $0.05\pm0.01$, respectively, in the protostellar core. The CO depletion factor also rises from $4.1\pm0.1$ to $5.0\pm0.1$ across the same transition. While the embedded YSO reduces deuteration in the dense inner gas, the less dense envelope traced by HCO$^+$ is only slightly affected at our resolution. Our analysis confirms that CO freeze-out and the presence of a protostar jointly regulate deuterium chemistry in star-forming regions.

 - **Abstract**
 We report spectral analysis on a 170 ks XRISM \textit{Resolve} exposure of the core of Cygnus A. Analyzing the full field of view spectrum in the $1.7-12.0$ keV band, we find evidence for two-temperature cluster gas. The hotter ($kT = 5.53 \pm 0.13$ keV) gas has a velocity dispersion of $261 \pm 13$ km s$^{-1}$ and a bulk velocity of $120 \pm 20$ km s$^{-1}$ with respect to the central galaxy. The cooler gas ($kT = 2.0^{+0.4}_{-0.3}$ keV) has an even broader velocity dispersion of $440 \pm 130$ km s$^{-1}$, with a systematic uncertainty of $120$ km s$^{-1}$. The relative line-of-sight velocity between the hotter and cooler gas can be as high as $450 \pm 140$ km s$^{-1}$. We interpret the high velocity dispersions as a combination of turbulence and bulk motion due to the cocoon shock. The upper limit on the non-thermal pressure fraction for the hotter gas is $7.7 \pm 0.7\%$. We associate the cooler gas with the central region ($<35$ kpc) and the hotter phase with the gas surrounding it ($35-100$ kpc). The total energy due to the kinetic motion is $5.1 \times 10^{60}$ erg, consistent with the energy associated with the central radio source. The kinetic energy injection rate is $6.9 \times 10^{44}-7.4 \times 10^{45}$ erg s$^{-1}$ under varying assumptions of injection timescales. The range of injection power is higher than the cooling luminosity, and thus the heating and cooling rates in Cygnus A are unbalanced.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent observations suggest that Tycho's supernova remnant (SNR; SN 1572) is expanding into a cavity wall of molecular clouds (MCs), which decelerate the SNR and influence its multi-wavelength morphology. To constrain the physical properties of environmental MCs and search for heated gas, we perform a JCMT $^{12}$CO $J$=3--2 observation and compare with previous $^{12}$CO $J$=2--1, $^{12}$CO $J$=1--0 and $^{13}$CO $J$=1--0 data. We present the $^{12}$CO $J$=3--2 map toward Tycho and show that the $^{12}$CO $J$=3--2 spatial distribution and line profiles are similar to those of the lower-$J$ CO lines. By comparing the multiple transitions of CO and the RADEX (Radiative transfer code in non-Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium) models, we constrain the physical properties of molecular gas surrounding Tycho: the northern cloud has a molecular column density of $N({\rm H}_{2})=0.5$ -- $4.5\times 10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$, while other regions have $N({\rm H}_{2})=0.2$ -- $3.9\times10^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$; the kinetic temperatures $T_{\rm k}$ of these clouds are in the range of 9 -- 22 K and the volume densities $n({\rm H}_{2})$ are 20 -- $700$ cm$^{-3}$. We also discuss the difficulty in finding hot molecular gas shocked by such a young SNR. We estimate that the shocked molecular layer can be as thin as 0.003 pc, corresponding to $0.2''$ at the distance of 2.5 kpc, which is 2 orders of magnitude smaller than the angular resolution of current CO observations. Therefore, our molecular observations are largely insensitive to the thin shocked gas layer; instead, they detect the environmental gas.
#### Tracking Protostellar Variability in Massive Protoclusters with ALMA: I. Insights from QUARKS and MaMMOtH

 - **Abstract**
 Millimeter/submillimeter variability is often attributed to dynamical disk-mediated accretion, yet detection is limited to low-mass protostars in nearby clouds. Recent observations have also revealed significant (sub)millimeter variability in high-mass protostars, but the confirmed cases are scarce and lack systematic monitoring. In this work, we analyzed multi-epoch Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) Band 6 (1.3 mm) continuum observations of 22 massive protoclusters, with epoch separations ranging from a few hours to more than two years, while achieving a consistent angular resolution of approximately 0.3 arcsec. These data allow us to track variability of protostars across a broader mass range and in an environment markedly different from nearby clouds. Using a custom processing pipeline for data reduction, image alignment, and relative flux calibration, we achieve high-precision flux measurements and, for the first time, investigate millimeter variability in massive protoclusters based on interferometric data in a statistical manner. Applying the astrodendro algorithm, we identified 383 condensations and tracked their variations in peak intensities. Standard deviation analysis and difference maps reveal five variable sources, corresponding to a lower limit of 1.3% on the variable fraction. Among these, I13111-6228 stands out as it hosts a hypercompact H II region that exhibits a 68% increase in continuum peak intensity over one year, with an uncertainty of 2%. This supports the burst-mode accretion picture in massive star formation as a viable route for the formation of massive stars.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a Bayesian framework that enhances the identification of strongly lensed gravitational waves (GWs) by incorporating informative positional priors from the Euclid galaxy lens catalog. The core of our method introduces a two-step reweighting scheme: first, gravitational wave parameter estimation is performed under a uniform sky prior; the resulting posterior is then used to reweight galaxy positions within the Euclid catalog, constructing an astrophysically informed positional prior. Comparing this Euclid-informed prior against a uniform prior within our framework reveals distinct behaviors. While the posterior estimates of the intrinsic waveform parameters show little sensitivity to the prior change, the Bayes factor for lensing identification exhibits significant prior dependence. Crucially, for truly lensed event pairs, the Bayes factor systematically increases, whereas for unlensed pairs it decreases. This dual effect is vital for robust discrimination. Our analysis demonstrates that this multi-messenger approach significantly improves the confidence of lensing searches. For lensed pairs, the method boosts the Bayes factor by an average factor of $\sim 10$, while effectively suppressing false positives for unlensed coincidences. This underscores the critical importance of prior specification and showcases the substantial gains achievable by synergizing gravitational-wave data with electromagnetic survey information.
#### A Systematic Study of Magnetic Fields Impacts on Neutrino Transport in Core-Collapse Supernovae

 - **Abstract**
 We quantify the impact of strong magnetic fields (assuming $B=B_0\cdot r_0^3/r^3$ with $B_0\gtrsim 10^{16}$ G) on the neutrino transport in core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe). Magnetic fields quantize the momenta of electrons and positrons, resulting in an enhanced absorption cross section for low-energy neutrinos and suppressed chemical potentials for $e^\pm$. We include these changes in the M1 scheme for neutrino transport and perform 1-D CCSNe simulations with \texttt{GR1D}. The increased low-energy cross sections reduce the $\bar{\nu}_e$ mean energy $\langle E_{\bar\nu_e}\rangle$ while elevating the neutrino number luminosities $\mathcal{L_\nu}$ for both ${\nu}_e$ and $\bar{\nu}_e$ due to the lower energy weighted spectra. The reduction of chemical potential enhances the $\bar{\nu}_e$ emission while suppressing that of $\nu_e$, thereby driving an increase in the electron fraction behind the stalled shock at $\sim30$--$100$ km. This further amplifies $\langle E_{\nu_e}\rangle$ through an increased electron density. Consequently, magnetic fields amplify $L_{\nu_e}$ by increasing both $\mathcal{L}_{\nu_e}$ and $\langle E_{\nu_e}\rangle$ whereas for $\bar\nu_e$, the rise in $\mathcal{L}_{\bar\nu_e}$ is offset by a decreased $\langle E_{\bar\nu_e}\rangle$, leading to a minimal change in $L_{\bar\nu_e}$. A systematic parameter scan of dipole field configurations suggests that, for $r_0 > 30$ km, $\langle E_{\bar{\nu}_e} \rangle$ is significantly suppressed and $L_{\nu_e}$ is enhanced if $B_0 \geq {2.7} \times 10^{16}$ G. These magnetic effects become negligible for $B_0$ below $\sim {7.4} \times 10^{15}$ G.

 - **Abstract**
 Space missions like CoRoT, Kepler, and TESS have made asteroseismology a powerful probe of stellar interiors. Red giants are key targets thanks to their rich mixed-mode oscillation spectra, which reveal properties of both core and envelope. However, current models of core helium-burning red giants still fail to fully reproduce observed oscillation patterns, largely due to uncertainties in mixing processes such as overshooting and semi-convection. This motivates the need for better seismic constraints to refine stellar models. We investigate how internal structural features shape asteroseismic signatures in core helium-burning stars, focusing on the links between seismic properties and internal chemical profiles. Using an updated version of the Liege stellar evolution code and its adiabatic oscillation code, we compute and analyse mixed-mode patterns for a range of stellar models. Our results show that sharp chemical gradients and central overshooting strongly influence the mixed-mode spectra. Changes in overshooting modify the extent of the semi-convective region, altering the local Brunt-Vaisala frequency and thus the observed period spacing. Variations in overshooting are compensated by shifts in semi-convective layers, keeping the total mixed-core size nearly constant across models. As a result, stellar evolution is only mildly affected, while the seismic signatures, especially the Brunt-Vaisala frequency profile, are highly sensitive to these internal adjustments.

 - **Abstract**
 Young binary stars with discs provide unique laboratories to study the earliest stages of planet formation in star-forming environments. The detection of substructure in discs around Class I protostars challenges current models of disc evolution, suggesting that planets may form earlier than previously expected ($<1$ Myr). In the context of the ALMA Large Program FAUST, we present observations of the circumbinary disc (CBD) around the young binary system L1551 IRS 5. The CBD exhibits two prominent over-densities in the continuum emission at the edge of the cavity, with the Northern over-density being about 20% brighter than the Southern one. By analysing the disc morphology and kinematics of L1551 IRS 5, we delineate dynamical constraints on the binary's orbital parameters. Additionally, we present 3D hydrodynamical models of the CBD to predict both the dust and the gas surface densities. Then, we compare the resulting synthetic observations with ALMA observations of the continuum emission at 1.3 mm and the C$^{18}$O line emission. Our analysis suggests that the density enhancements observed with ALMA in L1551 IRS 5 can be caused by interactions between the binary stars and the CBD, leading to dust concentration within the disc. We conclude that the observed over-density corresponds to a location where could potentially grow under favourable conditions.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent high-resolution and sensitivity ALMA observations have unveiled the carbon isotope ratios ($^{12}$C/$^{13}$C) of Complex Organic Molecules (COMs) in a low-mass protostellar source. To understand the $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratios of COMs, we investigated the carbon isotope fractionation of COMs from prestellar cores to protostellar cores with a gas-grain chemical network model. We confirmed that the $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratios of small molecules are bimodal in the prestellar phase: CO and species formed from CO (e.g., CH$_{3}$OH) are slightly enriched in $^{13}$C compared to the local ISM (by $\sim$ 10 $\%$), while those from C and C$^{+}$ are depleted in $^{13}$C owing to isotope exchange reactions. COMs are mainly formed on the grain surface and in the hot gas ($>$ 100 K) in the protostellar phase. The $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratios of COMs depend on which molecules the COMs are formed from. In our base model, some COMs in the hot gas are depleted in $^{13}$C compared to the observations. Thus, We additionally incorporate reactions between gaseous atomic C and H$_{2}$O ice or CO ice on the grain surface to form H$_2$CO ice or \ce{C2O} ice, as suggested by recent laboratory studies. The direct C-atom addition reactions open pathways to form \ce{^13C}-enriched COMs from atomic C and CO ice. We find that these direct C-atom addition reactions mitigate $^{13}$C-depletion of COMs, and the model with the direct C-atom addition reactions better reproduces the observations than our base model. We also discuss the impact of the cosmic ray ionization rate on the $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratio of COMs.

 - **Abstract**
 We perform population synthesis modeling of isolated neutron stars in the Milky Way over its lifetime. Compared with previous studies, we use more detailed models of the interstellar medium and the magneto-rotational evolution of neutron stars. We demonstrate that presently, the spin-down rate at the propeller stage is the main uncertain factor that influences the number of accreting isolated neutron stars. If the propeller stage duration allows neutron stars to begin accreting matter from the interstellar medium and if the efficiency of accretion is high, then the number of accreting isolated neutron stars in eROSITA data can reach ~a few thousand. Still, uncertainties in spin-down at the propeller stage and in the accretion process can drastically decrease this number. We suggest that future observations of neutron stars in wide low-mass binaries recently discovered by Gaia can clarify these issues.

 - **Abstract**
 Gravitationally lensed quasars are viable cosmic tools for constraining a diversity of fundamental astrophysical phenomena; They enable identification of faint, low-mass supermassive black holes, provide unique constraints on the intervening intergalactic or interstellar medium in their sightlines, and can be used to determine key cosmological quantities such as the Hubble constant, $H_0$. However, they are rare phenomena, and it has proven difficult to define efficient, unbiased selection methods.} In this study, we report the spectroscopic identification of a remarkable triple-lensed quasar system at $z=2.67$, identified based on its astrometric measurements from the {\em Gaia} mission, as well as a larger spectroscopic follow-up survey of {\em Gaia}-detected candidate lensed quasars. We characterize in detail the three mirror images of the quasar and their spatial and temporal spectroscopic coverage, with focus on the emission-line properties which shows variation across sigthlines and temporal evolution over the $\sim 11$months spectroscopic campaign. We construct a lens model of the foreground source from a combination of the multiple spectra and deep optical imaging, providing a robust halo mass of $M_{\rm h} = (2.78 \pm 0.05)\times 10^{10}M_\odot$. Based on the lens model, the time delay between each sightline is translated into an intrinsic quasar time, allowing us to construct a quasar timeseries over $\sim18$months with monthly cadence. Over months timescales the broad emission lines vary in both velocity offset and equivalent width (EW) as well as an overall increase in ionization. This exemplary triple-lensed quasars demonstrates the viability of identifying such rare lens configurations based purely on the astrometric measurements from the {\em Gaia} mission, which we here provide optimized selection criteria for, for future studies.

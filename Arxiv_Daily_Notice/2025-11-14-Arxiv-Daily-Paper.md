 - **Abstract**
 The aim of extensive air shower (EAS) analysis is to reconstruct the physical parameters of the primary particle that initiated the shower. The TAIGA experiment is a hybrid detector system that combines several imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes (IACTs) and an array of non-imaging Cherenkov detectors (TAIGA-HiSCORE) for EAS detection. Because the signals recorded by different detector types differ in physical nature, the direct merging of data is unfeasible, which complicates multimodal analysis. Currently, to analyze data from the IACTs and TAIGA-HiSCORE, a set of auxiliary parameters specific to each detector type is calculated from the recorded signals. These parameters are chosen empirically, so there is no certainty that they retain all important information and are the best suited for the respective problems. We propose to use autoencoders (AE) for the analysis of TAIGA experimental data and replace the conventionally used auxiliary parameters with the parameters of the AE latent space. The advantage of the AE latent space parameters is that they preserve essential physics from experimental data without prior assumptions. This approach also holds potential for enabling seamless integration of heterogeneous IACT and HiSCORE data through a joint latent space. To reconstruct the parameters of the primary particle of the EAS from the latent space of the AE, a separate artificial neural network is used. In this paper, the proposed approach is used to reconstruct the energy of the EAS primary particles based on Monte Carlo simulation data for TAIGA-HiSCORE. The dependence of the energy determination accuracy on the dimensionality of the latent space is analyzed, and these results are also compared with the results obtained by the conventional technique. It is shown that when using the AE latent space, the energy of the primary particle is reconstructed with satisfactory accuracy.

 - **Abstract**
 Through 3D hydrodynamical simulations, we explore the impact of Type Ia supernova (SN) explosions on the star formation history and chemical properties of second-generation (SG) stars in young globular clusters with masses of 10^5-10^6 Msun. We assume that the SG is formed out of the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) ejecta of first-generation stars plus pristine interstellar medium gas which is modelled as a uniform gas moving at a constant velocity towards the cluster. We tested two values for the infalling gas density of 10^(-24) and 10^(23) g/cm^3. Type Ia SNe start to explode together with the release of gas from the most massive AGB stars. Three simulated models are analyzed. In the low-mass and low-density scenario, we find that SNe Ia quench star formation which however restarts when the gas cools down again in between two explosions. SG stars are dominated by a He-rich population (Y>0.33), which is poorly diluted by pristine gas. In the high-mass models, star formation is mildly affected, while the He composition is significantly altered as exploding SNe prevent the accretion of pristine gas and therefore extremely helium-rich stars form. In the high-density model, such weak gas accretion leads to a maximum enhancement in helium mass fraction much larger than the observed one and not correlating with the initial cluster mass as found in models without Type Ia SNe. As for the iron content, small spreads have been found in all models, but the SG is less homogeneous than the FG, at variance with current observations.

 - **Abstract**
 POLAR-2 is a next-generation space astronomy platform led by China, with its core scientific objective focused on high-precision polarization measurements of gamma-ray bursts. As one of its key payloads, the Low-energy Polarization Detector (LPD) is designed to perform wide-field surveys to capture X-ray polarization information from gamma-ray bursts in the 2-10 keV energy range. This paper presents Topmetal-L, a dedicated charge-sensitive pixel sensor developed for the LPD prototype upgrade. Fabricated in a 130 nm CMOS process in 2024, the chip integrates a 356 $\times$ 512 pixel array with a pixel pitch of 45 $\mu$m. Each pixel incorporates a 26 $\times$ 26 $\mu$m^2 charge-collecting electrode window and is capable of simultaneously outputting both energy and position information of deposited charges. Topmetal-L has been systematically optimized for power consumption, noise performance, and readout efficiency. It exhibits an input dynamic range of 0-4 ke-, a typical charge-to-voltage conversion gain of 76.04 $\mu$V/e-, an average equivalent noise charge of approximately 22.8 e-, a sensitive area exceeding 3.6 cm^2, and a total power consumption of 720 mW per chip. To meet the requirements of large-area, high-frame-rate readout for gas-based polarization detectors, a sentinel-scanning readout scheme is proposed, reducing the full-frame readout time to 730 $\mu$s. A prototype Topmetal-L-based gas polarization detection system was evaluated across key energies: it exhibited a residual modulation of 0.26% $\pm$ 0.45% at 5.90 keV, a modulation factor of 66.67% $\pm$ 0.45% for a linearly polarized 8.0 keV source, and a counting rate saturated at 15 k counts/(cm^2$\cdot$s) when tested at 5.4 keV.

 - **Abstract**
 We present imaging spectroscopy of the "supernebula" in the nearby dwarf galaxy NGC 5253 with the MIRI-MRS integral field spectrometer of the JWST. NGC 5253 is host to an luminous ($L\sim 10^9~\rm L_\odot$) HII region, powered by a giant young star cluster, a possible local analogue to super star cluster formation at Cosmic Dawn and Noon. In this paper, the first in a series about the mid-infrared line and continuum emission in the center of NGC 5253, we present an overview and continuum spectra. The mid-infrared images reveal four sources of continuum emission from hot dust that we identify as luminous HII regions, which are used to define spectral apertures. The dominant continuum source is the pc-scale supernebula core seen at radio wavelengths. We find that the MIR to radio continuum flux ratio for all regions is identical to that of Galactic HII regions. The 9.7 silicate feature is present and strongest in absorption toward the supernebula. Silicate emission is seen in another HII region. PAH features are present, although weak, particularly in the supernebula; the strongest emission is in an HII region only 15 pc from the supernebula core. PAH features at 6.2$\mu$m and 11.3$\mu$m are detected in all sources. Comparison of the luminosity implied by the ionization to the observed infrared luminosity suggest that at least 25% ofthe photons are escaping the embedded supernebula core, in spite of its high, $A_V\gtrsim 15$, extinction.

 - **Abstract**
 The nearby dwarf starburst NGC 5253 is dominated by a compact radio-infrared supernebula powered by a very young and bright embedded Super Star Cluster (SSC) of $\sim 10^9 L_\odot$. We observed this source and its surroundings over the 5-25$\mu$m range with MIRI/MRS on JWST and in Paper I presented the JWST view of the region and its continuum features. We now present the more than 70 emission lines of HI, $H_2$ and metal ions detected by MIRI/MRS. We derive the extinction by comparing HI recombination to the free-free radio continuum and find that it is very flat, i.e., almost independent of wavelength, over this spectral range. Nebular conditions are consistent with young ($\lesssim5\times10^6$ years) and very massive stars. All regions show high excitation, but the spatial distribution of the high excitation lines suggests that photons with energies close to 50eV are escaping the supernebula core in spite of 35 magnitudes of visual extinction.

 - **Abstract**
 We present two new radio continuum images from the ASKAP POSSUM survey in the direction of the Small Magellanic Cloud. The two new source lists contain 36,571 radio continuum sources detected at 944 MHz and 15,227 sources at 1367 MHz, with beam sizes of approximately 14.5 by 12.2 arcsec and 8.7 by 8.2 arcsec, respectively. We used the Aegean software package to generate these point source catalogues, and together with the previously published MeerKAT catalogue, we estimated spectral indices for the full set of matched radio point sources. By cross-matching our ASKAP catalogues with the MeerKAT data, we identified 21,442 and 12,654 common point sources at 944 MHz and 1367 MHz, respectively, using a 2 arcsec matching radius. These new catalogues improve our understanding of the Small Magellanic Cloud and demonstrate the capability of current radio telescopes such as ASKAP to investigate diverse galactic source populations

 - **Abstract**
 We analyze observational data on methanol masers in the disks of young massive stellar objects in the massive star formation regions: NGC6334I, G33.641-0.228, G12.89+0.49. Special attention is paid to analysis of the magnetic fields and their possible connection with maser flares. For this purpose, we estimate the distance from star to maser, the magnetospheric radius and magnetic field strength in the region of this radius. The distances from stars to masing regions lie in range from 380 to 620 au. Stellar and disk's magnetic field strengths are comparable at the magnetosphere boundary and lie in the range from 590 to 1880 G for considered objects. Our estimates show that the magnetic fields may play an important role in the considered regions. In particular, observed luminosity bursts and maser flares may be related to magnetic reconnection events near the stars.
#### Revealing the Connection Between the Filamentary Hierarchy and Star Cluster Formation in a Simulated NGC 628 Galaxy

 - **Abstract**
 There is abundant observational evidence for the hierarchical, interconnected nature of filaments in the interstellar medium (ISM) extending from galactic down to sub-parsec scales. New JWST images of NGC 628 in particular, show clusters forming along the two spiral arms of this galaxy. In this paper we investigate filament and cluster properties in an NGC 628-like multi-scale high-resolution magnetohydrodynamic simulation. We use a filament finding tool to identify filaments and derive the probability density functions (PDFs) for the filament lengths and masses. Using a clustering algorithm we identify star clusters formed between 268 to 278 Myr and follow this population as the galaxy evolves for 60 Myr, calculating their mass PDFs, average radius growth rate, and average mass loss rate. We find a power-law index of alpha_m = -1.35 for the filament masses. Calculating the power-law index from our cluster mass PDF, we find a value of alpha_{c,m} = -1.35 when the clusters first form, exactly our filament mass power-law index. This shows that properties of young clusters arise from the gravitational fragmentation of their host filaments. We track the post-formation evolution of the clusters as they become unbound, increase in radius and decrease in mass yielding an ever steeper mass power-law index. After 60 Myr, the mass power-law index is alpha_{c,m} = -1.55, matching other simulations and observations.

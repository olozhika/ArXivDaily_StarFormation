 - **Abstract**
 Young massive clusters (YMCs) provide favorable environments for frequent stellar collisions, potentially leading to the formation of very massive stars (VMSs) and seeds of intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs). We investigate the role of repeated stellar collisions in YMCs using TITANS, a new suite of 18 direct $N$-body simulations. Our models span cluster masses $10^5 - 10^6\,\rm M_\odot$, half-mass densities $\rho_{\rm h}=100 - 10^5\,\rm M_\odot\,pc^{-3}$, and include high primordial binary fractions, consistent with observations of massive stars in young clusters. Overall, our simulations assume cluster properties that are typical of YMCs in the low-redshift Universe. We find that repeated stellar collisions are efficient only in the densest clusters with short relaxation times and are absent in systems with $\rho_{\rm h}<500\,\rm M_\odot\,pc^{-3}$ and $t_{\rm rh}>1.3\,\rm Gyr$. Rapid mass segregation allows massive stars to sink to the cluster center, merge, and undergo subsequent collisions, even in clusters with long core-collapse times. However, collision chains are typically triggered by primordial binary mergers and usually involve only two collisions. In our simulations, only three VMSs form through repeated collisions and reach $m_*>330\,\rm M_\odot$, while most VMSs have $m_*<300\,\rm M_\odot$ and form through primordial binary mergers. None constitute viable IMBH seeds, as their helium cores fall in the (pulsational) pair-instability regime. We form five IMBHs from stellar collisions involving stars at different evolutionary stages, while the dominant channel is the merger of stellar-mass black holes, producing twelve IMBHs. For properties typical of local YMCs, stellar collision chains are therefore inefficient in producing IMBHs more massive than $140\,\rm M_\odot$, as most collisionally formed VMSs attain masses that fall in the pair-instability regime.
#### Bonnor-Ebert sphere collapse in filamentary structures

 - **Abstract**
 Star formation within filaments may arise due to the growth of cores according to linear perturbation theory. This implies a minimum core separation, as shorter modes would not be able to grow. While many observations agree with core separations by theoretical predictions, some observations also show star forming cores which lie closer together than the minimum wavelength given by perturbation theory. We explore whether non-linear effects during the late stages of core growth can explain the discrepancy between theory and observations. We perform three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations with the Ramses code to follow the evolution of initial perturbations within filaments and compare the measured growth rates to expectations from theoretical models. Non-linear evolution sets in as soon as the core mass reaches a value where the gravitational potential is not any longer dominated by the cylindrical potential of the filament but by the spherical potential of the Bonnor-Ebert sphere. Consequently, core collapse is not triggered by the loss of hydrostatic stability of the filament but by the loss of hydrostatic stability of the Bonnor-Ebert sphere. As the core is embedded in the filament, the maximum core mass is given by the pressure within the filament which results in a constant line-mass threshold for core collapse. As core collapse is triggered as soon as overdensities reach a certain line-mass, cores which form as large line-mass perturbations during filament formation can go into direct collapse even if their separation is closer than predicted by linear perturbation theory. Therefore, our result can explain the discrepancy between theory and observations.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a comprehensive radio polarization study of the Perseus molecular cloud using wideband L-band observations from the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array. Our survey covers $\sim13.8$~deg$^2$ with a mean Stokes~$I$ sensitivity of $\sim80~\mu$Jy~beam$^{-1}$, enabling the detection of 1410 compact radio sources. From this population, we construct a catalog of source properties, including positions, integrated flux densities, and spectral indices measured across nine spectral windows. The majority of sources exhibit negative spectral indices, consistent with non-thermal synchrotron emission. Using RM Synthesis and RM CLEAN techniques, we detect 205 polarized background sources above an $8\sigma$ threshold. This corresponds to a sampling density of $\sim14.8$~deg$^{-2}$, representing more than an order-of-magnitude increase compared to previous NVSS-based measurements. The resulting rotation measures exhibit coherent large-scale variations across the surveyed region, with additional small-scale structure superimposed. The enhanced sensitivity, frequency coverage, and sampling density of our observations enable a substantially improved mapping of the line-of-sight magnetic field component toward the Perseus molecular cloud compared to previous surveys.

 - **Abstract**
 In orbital mechanics, Gauss's method for orbit determination (OD) is a popular, minimal assumption solution for obtaining the initial state estimate of a passing resident space object (RSO). Since much of the cislunar domain relies on three-body dynamics, a key assumption of Gauss's method is rendered incompatible, creating a need for a new, minimal assumption method for initial orbit determination (IOD). In this work, we present a framework for short and long term probabilistic target tracking in cislunar space which produces an initial state estimate with as few assumptions as possible. Specifically, we propose an IOD method involving the kinematic fitting of several series of noisy, consecutive ground-based observations. Once a probabilistic initial state estimate in the form of a particle cloud is formed, we apply the powerful Particle Gaussian Mixture (PGM) Filter to reduce the uncertainty of our state estimate over time. This combined IOD/OD framework is demonstrated for several classes of trajectories in cislunar space and compared to better-known filtering frameworks.
#### 3D radiative transfer modeling of scattering polarization with partial frequency redistribution I. Verification and disk-center results for the solar Ca I 4227 Å line

 - **Abstract**
 Several strong solar resonance lines show observable linear scattering polarization signals, holding a great potential for investigating the magnetism of the outer solar atmosphere. Accurately modeling these signals requires solving the radiative transfer (RT) problem for polarized radiation in comprehensive 3D models of the solar atmosphere, in non-local thermodynamic equilibrium, accounting for partial frequency redistribution (PRD) effects. This problem has so far been computationally inaccessible. We present the first scientific application of TRIP, a novel software for the massively parallel solution of the 3D non-LTE RT problem for polarized radiation, including scattering polarization and PRD. We aim to verify the code and explore the combined action of PRD and the 3D structure of the solar atmosphere on scattering polarization. We run TRIP to synthesize the Stokes profiles of the Ca I line at 4227 Å in a 3D model of the solar atmosphere extracted from a radiation magneto-hydrodynamic simulation. We efficiently solve the resulting large-scale problem, with up to $4 \times 10^{10}$ degrees of freedom, with a state-of-the-art preconditioned Krylov method, using up to 20 thousand parallel CPUs. After including verification tests, we find that the joint impact of PRD effects and the detailed 3D structure of the atmospheric model produce disk-center scattering polarization signals in the line wings. These signals are sensitive to the magnetic field, via magneto-optical effects, and to bulk velocity gradients. We also show that the CRD approximation underestimates the amplitude of disk-center line-core signals. This achievement represents a crucial step forward for diagnosing the magnetism of the solar chromosphere and transition region through the quantitative comparisons of synthetic and observational data.
#### A geometric physics-informed machine learning inference for the neutron star maximum mass and the inverse problem

 - **Abstract**
 The existence of a distinct mass boundary between the heaviest neutron stars and the lightest black holes remains in question. It is an artefact of our ignorance of the properties of matter at supra-nuclear densities, which exist in the cores of neutron stars. The study addresses these problems with a physics-informed machine learning approach, guided by astrophysical observations. The Transformer model is trained on an agnostically generated ensemble of equations of state. Two geometric parameters are defined on the mass-radius sequence of a neutron star--the front bending and the back bending. The transformer provides a two-step solution: first, the model predicts the maximum mass and radius using the bending parameters. Second, it predicts the square of the sound speed profile, completing the inverse mapping. The prediction is that massive neutron stars form when the sound speed peaks at low density, leading to strong back-bending and an early phase transition to quark matter. Massive stars favour a stiff equation of state at low density, and the density of matter at the star's core is sufficiently small. The maximum mass for a neutron star predicted by the astrophysical constrained transformer model is $2.477$ solar masses, and a minimum radius of about $11.498$ km for a neutron star of $1.4$ solar masses.
#### The GUAPOS project -- VII: Physical structure and molecular environment of the G31.41+0.31 HII region

 - **Abstract**
 Ionised regions around OB-type stars are formed at an early stage of their evolution and are important to investigate the formation process of these objects. However, so far only few observations of their physical structure and interaction with the parental molecular cloud have been made. The high resolution and sensitivity of new instruments such as ALMA and the upgraded VLA allow us to fill this gap in our knowledge. We investigate the well known core-halo ultracompact HII region G31.41+0.31 and the surrounding molecular clump with the aim to determine the density and temperature of both the ionised and neutral gas, and possibly obtain a 3D picture of their spacial distribution. We take advantage of the full-band frequency coverage at 3 mm obtained with ALMA for the GUAPOS project to image the emission of a plethora of hydrogen recombination lines towards the G31.41+0.31 HII region as well as several molecular transitions which are tracers of medium-density ($\sim$$10^4$--$10^6$ cm$^{-3}$) gas. The line data are complemented by continuum measurements obtained with the VLA at 1 cm and 7 mm. By fitting these lines also using a model that takes into account non-LTE effects we can investigate the density and temperature structure and the velocity field of the region. Our findings, based on a model fit accounting for non-LTE effects, indicate that the electron temperature of the HII region is mostly spanning a range between 5000 and 6000 K, while the density varies between 2500 and 7500 cm$^{-3}$. All in all, the distribution of these parameters as well as the corresponding velocity field hint at a cometary shaped HII region expanding away from the observer to the NW. The molecular gas appears to be still infalling towards the peak of the UC HII region, and its density and temperature are consistent with pressure confinement of the ionised gas to the SE.
#### Linear filament and nested cluster evolution tomography (LANCET) I. Capture the evolution of dense gas in 14-parsec filament G316.8

 - **Abstract**
 A dynamic view of mass assembly is essential for understanding the formation of massive stars and clusters. Interpreting evolutionary diagnostics from Galactic-wide surveys, however, requires careful control of distance and environmental variations. The G316.8 filament provides an ideal laboratory: a 14-pc nearly linear structure composed of three contiguous subregions with comparable molecular gas reservoirs (~10,000 $M_\odot$ each) but spanning a clear evolutionary sequence from an infrared dark cloud (young) through a massive young stellar object (intermediate) to an HII region (evolved). As part of the Linear filament and nested cluster evolution tomography (LANCET) project, we mapped the full filament with the Atacama Compact Array at 1.3 mm, achieving 0.08 pc resolution over 17.1 pc$^2$. Combined with Herschel and APEX/ArTéMiS data, we derived high-resolution temperature and column-density maps. We quantify structural evolution using dense-fragment statistics, column-density PDFs, and $\Delta$-variance analysis. From young to evolved regions, the maximum fragment mass increases from 8 to 490 $M_\odot$, while the dense-gas mass fraction ($>0.5$ g cm$^{-2}$) rises from 0.4% to 9.6%. The N-PDF develops a secondary power-law tail and the $\Delta$-variance slope becomes progressively shallower, indicating ongoing assembly of dense sub-parsec structures. Our further ALMA 12m continuum and spectral line data will extend this dynamic scenarios down to 800 AU scale.
#### Chandra Proper Motions and Milliarcsecond Astrometry of Nineteen Pulsars

 - **Abstract**
 We present X-ray proper motion (PM) measurements of 19 pulsars using new and archival data from the Chandra X-ray Observatory, including pulsar wind trails and X-ray filaments. Precise X-ray PMs are often limited by uncertainties in aligning observations to a common reference frame. Our analysis uses unresolved X-ray flux from stars in the Gaia catalog in addition to X-ray bright point sources for alignment, improving uncertainties. We obtain absolute positions referenced to Gaia with typical astrometric precision $\sim$10 mas and PM statistical uncertainties down to 1.3 mas yr$^{-1}$, the most precise X-ray PM achieved to date. With our improved frame alignment, PM accuracies are now limited by the pulsar flux in most cases. These results reveal a new X-ray filament and illuminate the wind nebula structures and origins of several of these pulsars.

 - **Abstract**
 Double periodic variables (DPVs) are hot Algol-type interacting binary systems with an orbital and a long photometric cycle. The origin of the latter may be related to cyclic structural changes in the accretion disc that surrounds the gainer star that are driven by a variable mass-transfer rate. If this is the case, changes in the orbital light curve would be expected throughout the long cycle. We conducted a detailed photometric analysis of the light curves of 134 Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) DPVs to investigate variations in the morphology of the orbital light curves as a function of the long-cycle phase. We separated the two photometric cycles from the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) I band light curves for the systems. We thus compared the orbital light curves at opposite long-cycle phases, investigated the stability of the long period, and analysed the residuals of the separation process to search for significant frequencies above a 1% false-alarm probability threshold. We confirm that the DPVs OGLE-LMC-DPV-097 and OGLE-BLG-ECL-157529 change most strongly in their orbital light curves throughout the long cycle. By comparison, about 50% of the sample exhibits moderate morphological variations, in particular, around orbital phase 0.5. This is likely associated with structural changes in the accretion discs. In addition, we identified 18 DPVs with variable long periods, including 10 new cases. In some of them, the long period either increases or decreases continuously over time. For the first time, we found DPV systems that alternate between the two behaviours at different epochs. Moreover, we detected frequencies in the residuals that might be directly related to changes in the morphology of the orbital curves. Finally, some previously reported frequencies disappear when a variable long period is taken into account.
#### Evidence For Turbulent Concentration In Particle-Laden Midplane Layers of Planet-Forming Disks

 - **Abstract**
 In this study we investigate the axisymmetric, weakly turbulent state of settled particle layers in a localized model of a protoplanetary disk. We focus on conditions in which the large-scale axisymmetric filaments typically associated with the streaming instability (SI) either cannot form or have not yet developed. Under these circumstances, we observe small-scale particle clumping consistent with turbulent concentration (TC), in which short particle filaments collect along regions of high gas strain rate and enclose gas-only voids exhibiting coherent vorticity. Despite varying particle Stokes numbers $\St_K$ which are defined relative to the Keplerian frequency, the {\it effective} Stokes numbers within voids, $\St_\omega$ -- defined instead relative to the local gas vorticity -- consistently center around 0.3. The latter coincides with the special value identified in prior statistical studies of TC as the scale where particle clustering is most intermittent. This convergence likely reflects how particle feedback structures and sustains voids -- an effect possibly distinctive to axisymmetric configurations. A timescale comparison reveals that in simulations with midplane particle-to-gas density ratios below unity and $\St_K \ll 1$, SI growth rates are 1 -- 2 orders of magnitude slower than the turbulent overturn frequencies at the driving scale. This disparity appears to effectively rule out SI as the primary driver of turbulence in these cases. Instead, we suggest the Symmetric Instability (SymI) may be responsible. We further observe that for St$_K\ll 1$, TC is a persistent feature of turbulent particle layers , and that Roche-exceeding small-scale fluctuations within large-scale SI filaments reported in the literature are in fact not SI, but expressions of TC amplified by the elevated particle densities within those large-scale structures.
#### Evolution of magnetized hub-filament systems: Comparing the observed properties of W3(OH), W3 Main, and S 106

 - **Abstract**
 In this study, we examine three cluster-forming hub-filament systems (HFS) - W3(OH), W3 Main, and S 106 - spanning evolutionary stages from early to advanced, with a focus on their magnetic field (B-field) structures and filament line-mass distributions. Our goal is to identify indicators of HFS evolution, particularly within their hubs, as star formation progresses. Our analysis combines observations of dense star-forming gas and young stellar populations. We present new JCMT/POL-2 observations of 850micron dust polarized emission to probe magnetic field morphology and dense gas structures. Archival infrared and radio data are also used to trace star formation activity. We derive radial column density profiles centered on the hubs to define distinct filament and hub regions. We then analyze histograms of line mass, polarization intensity (PI), polarization fraction (PF), and the relative orientation between B-fields and filaments. As HFS evolve, we observe changes in the filament line-mass function (FLMF), PF, and B-field-filament alignment - especially within the hub, which also increases in size. Massive bipolar outflows and radiation bubbles reshape the plane-of-sky B-fields, aligning them with cavity walls and shells, consistent with known rearrangements near HII regions. We also find a notable similarity between hub sizes and young cluster radii. "Double-node" star formation - where two subregions within a hub show different evolutionary stages - emerges as a common HFS feature. We present evidence for its widespread occurrence across several well-studied, nearby star-forming clouds.
#### A D/H Ratio Consistent with Earth's Water in Halley-type Comet 12P from ALMA HDO Mapping

 - **Abstract**
 Isotopic measurements of Solar System bodies provide a primary paradigm within which to understand the origins and histories of planetary materials. The D/H ratio in particular, helps reveal the relationship between (and heritage of) different H$_2$O reservoirs within the Solar System. Here we present interferometric maps of water (H$_2$O) and semiheavy water (HDO) in the gas-phase coma of a comet (Halley-type comet 12P/Pons-Brooks), obtained using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). The maps are consistent with outgassing of both H$_2$O and HDO directly from the nucleus, and imply a coma D/H ratio (for water) of $(1.71 \pm 0.44)\times10^{-4}$. This is at the lower end of the range of previously-observed values in comets, and is consistent with D/H in Earth's ocean water. Our results suggest a possible common heritage between a component of the Oort cloud's water ice reservoir, and the water that was delivered to the young Earth during the early history of the Solar System.

 - **Abstract**
 Since the discovery of the binary neutron star merger GW170817 and its associated kilonova, neutron star mergers have been established as a key production channel for $r$-process elements in the Universe. However, observations of $r$-process abundances as inferred from stellar spectra of Milky Way disk stars, together with chemical evolution modeling, suggest that additional channels are needed to fully account for the $r$-process element enrichment in the Milky Way. Neutron star-black hole mergers and fast-merging binary neutron star systems are among the leading alternative candidates. In this study, we combine gravitational-wave observations from LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA with data from short gamma-ray bursts, Galactic pulsars, and Galactic [Eu/Fe] vs [Fe/H] abundance observations to assess the contribution of these mergers to $r$-process enrichment in the Galactic disk. We find that neither neutron star-black hole mergers nor fast-merging binary neutron star populations can serve as the dominant additional channel without generating strong tension with existing observations and theoretical expectations. These results constrain the viable sources of Galactic $r$-process enrichment and underscore the necessity of non-merger production channels.

 - **Abstract**
 Low-velocity large-scale shocks impacting on the ISM may efficiently shape molecular clouds and trigger star formation within them. These shocks, both driven by galactic bubbles and/or cloud-cloud collisions, leave specific signatures in the gas morphology and kinematics. Observational studies of such signatures are crucial to investigate if and how shocks affect the clouds formation process and trigger their future star formation. We have analysed the shocked and dense gas tracers SiO(2-1) and H13CO+(1-0) emission toward the IRDC G035.39-00.33, using new, larger-scale maps obtained with the 30m telescope at the Instituto de Radioastronomìa Millimétrica. We find that the dense gas is organised into a northern and a southern filament having different velocities and tilted orientation with respect to each other. The two filaments are spatially separated yet connected by a faint bridge feature also seen in a position-velocity diagram extracted across the cloud. This bridge-feature, typical of cloud-cloud collisions, also coincides with a very spectrally narrow SiO-traced emission. The northern filament is suggested to be interacting with the nearby supernova remnant G035.6-0.4. Toward the southern filament, we also report the presence of a parsec-scale, spectrally narrow SiO emission likely driven by the interaction between this filament and a nearby expanding shell. The shell is visible in the 1.3 GHz and 610 MHz continuum images and our preliminary analysis suggests it may be the relic of a supernova remnant. We conclude that the two filaments represent the densest part of two colliding clouds, pushed toward each other by nearby Supernova Remnants. We speculate that this cloud-cloud collision driven by stellar feedback may have assembled the infrared dark cloud. We also evaluate the possibility that star formation may have been triggered within G035.39-00.33 by the collision.
#### Development of 1-D non-ideal MHD simulation code towards understanding Long-term Evolution of Protoplanetary Disk

 - **Abstract**
 We developed a one-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulation code to investigate the long-term evolution of protoplanetary disks with low computational cost. In this simulation code, the physical processes necessary for protostellar formation and protoplanetary disk evolution, such as magnetic braking, non-ideal MHD effects, and angular momentum transport due to viscosity, are implemented. Using this simulation code, we performed the simulations of the long-term evolution of protoplanetary disks starting from the molecular cloud. Our simulation results suggest that the disk size and mass are a few tens of au and $\sim 0.01 M_\odot$ at $10^5$ years after protostellar formation. These values were relatively consistent with observations. The disk evolves through magnetic braking, and its radial profiles are consistent with the analytical solutions of previous studies. Our simulation code will be an important tool for studying the long-term evolution of protoplanetary disks.
#### Constraining Active Galactic Nucleus Jets with Spectrum and Core Shift: The Case of M87

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.06158

 - **Abstract**
 We analytically model stationary and axisymmetric active galactic nucleus jets, assuming energy conservation along each magnetic flux tube. Using very-long-baseline interferometry (VLBI) observations and published general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations, we constrain the evolution of the bulk Lorentz factor, the magnetization parameter, and the magnetic field strength along the jet. We then infer the electron density, emission coefficient, and absorption coefficient at each point, and integrate the radiative transfer equation to compute the spectral energy distribution (SED) and the core shift of the synchrotron emission from the relativistic jet. Applying the method to the M87 jet, we find that the hot plasmas are injected at the altitude of seven Schwarzschild radii from the black hole (BH), that the M87 jet is likely composed of a pair plasma, and that the jet flowline geometry is quasi-parabolic as reported at much greater distances. Fitting the nonthermal fraction of the leptonic jet as a function of position, we also find that most of the radio photons are emitted within 1000 Schwarzschild radii from the BH. Although hadronic jets do not reproduce all the VLBI observations consistently in our model, we also discuss that their heavy mass allows a stronger magnetic field within the observational constraints, leading to an inverted SED in sub-millimeter wavelengths by the thermal emission from the jet base. It is therefore implied that contemporaneous observations of the M87 jet with Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) and VLBI could discriminate the jet composition and its collimation within the central 100 Schwarzschild radii.

 - **Abstract**
 Galaxy mergers are among the most energetic astrophysical phenomena, driving intense star formation and potentially fueling cosmic ray acceleration, which can produce high energy $\gamma$-ray emission through hadronic processes. We present a targeted search for $\gamma$-ray emission from five prominent galaxy merger systems, NGC~3256, NGC~660, UGC~813/816, UGC~12914/12915, and VV~114 using 16.8 years of Fermi-LAT data in the 1--300~GeV energy range. Employing a binned maximum likelihood analysis, we model the emission with power-law spectra and derive spectral energy distributions (SEDs) to constrain $\gamma$-ray fluxes and spectral indices. Marginal detections are found for NGC~3256 (TS = 15.4, $\sim$3.51$\sigma$) and NGC~660 (TS = 8.16, $\sim$2.39$\sigma$), with photon fluxes of $(7.21 \pm 3.17) \times 10^{-11}$ and $(8.28 \pm 3.56) \times 10^{-11}$ ph cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$, respectively, suggesting merger driven star formation contributes to $\gamma$-ray emission. The remaining systems yield non-detections (TS $< 5$). This is the first targeted study of $\gamma$-ray emission from these aforementioned galaxy merger systems.
#### Slantwise convection and heat transport in the icy moon oceans

 - **Abstract**
 Ocean heat transport on icy moons shapes the ice shell topography, a primary observable of these moons. Two key processes control the heat transport: baroclinic instability driven by surface buoyancy contrasts and convective instability driven by heating from the core. However, global ocean simulations cannot accurately resolve convection under realistic icy moon conditions and instead often use Earth-based convective parameterizations, which capture only vertical convective mixing and cannot represent rotation-aligned slantwise convection on icy moons. We use high-resolution convection-resolving simulations to investigate ocean heat transport by slantwise convection in a parameter regime relevant to icy moons, isolated from baroclinic instability. Total heat transport follows the Coriolis-Inertial-Archimedean scaling with an added latitude dependence. The vertical transport increases with latitude, and the meridional transport is poleward. These results indicate that slantwise convection redistributes heat toward the poles, favoring a poleward-thinning ice shell, qualitatively consistent with Enceladus's observed ice thickness distribution.

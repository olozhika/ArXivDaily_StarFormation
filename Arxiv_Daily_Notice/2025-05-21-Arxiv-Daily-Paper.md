 - **Abstract**
 Planet formation around young stars requires the growth of interstellar dust grains from mm-sized particles to km-sized planetesimals. Numerical simulations have shown that large ($\sim$mm-sized) grains found in the inner envelope of young protostars could be lifted from the disc via winds. However we are still lacking unambiguous evidence for large grains in protostellar winds/outflows. We investigate dust continuum emission in the envelope of the Class I binary L1551 IRS5 in the Taurus molecular cloud, aiming to identify observational signatures of grain growth, such as variations in the dust emissivity index ($\beta_{\rm mm}$). In this context, we present new, high-angular resolution (50 au), observations of thermal dust continuum emission at 1.3 mm and 3 mm in the envelope ($\sim$3000 au) of L1551 IRS5 , obtained as part of the ALMA-FAUST Large Program. We analyse dust emission along the cavity walls of the CO outflow, extended up to $\sim$1800 au. We find an H$_2$ volume density $>2\times10^5$ cm$^{-3}$, a dust mass of $\sim$58 M$_\oplus$, and $\beta_{\rm mm}$<1, implying the presence of grains $\sim$10$^3$ times larger than the typical ISM sizes. We provide the first spatially resolved observational evidence of large grains within an outflow cavity wall. Our results suggest that these grains have been transported from the inner disc to the envelope by protostellar winds and may subsequently fall back into the outer disc by gravity and/or via accretion streamers. This cycle provides longer time for grains to grow, playing a crucial role in the formation of planetesimals.

 - **Abstract**
 Limb-resolved transmission spectroscopy has the potential to transform our understanding of exoplanetary atmospheres. By separately measuring the transmission spectra of the evening and morning limbs, these atmospheric regions can be individually characterized, shedding light into the global distribution and transport of key atmospheric properties from transit observations alone. In this work, we follow up the recent detection of limb asymmetry on the exoplanet WASP-107 b (Murphy et al. 2024) by reanalyzing literature observations of WASP-107 b using all of JWST's science intruments (NIRISS, NIRCam, NIRSpec, and MIRI) to measure its limb transmission spectra from $\sim$1-12 $\mu$m. We confirm the evening--morning temperature difference inferred previously and find that it is qualitatively consistent with predictions from global circulation models. We find evidence for evening--morning variation in SO$_2$ and CO$_2$ abundance, and significant cloud coverage only on WASP-107 b's morning limb. We find that the NIRISS and NIRSpec observations are potentially contaminated by occulted starspots, which we leverage to investigate stellar contamination's impact on limb asymmetry measurements. We find that starspot crossings can significantly bias the inferred evening and morning transmission spectra depending on when they occur during the transit, and develop a simple correction model which successfully brings these instruments' spectra into agreement with the uncontaminated observations.
#### Field-Level Comparison and Robustness Analysis of Cosmological N-Body Simulations

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first field-level comparison of cosmological N-body simulations, considering various widely used codes: Abacus, CUBEP$^3$M, Enzo, Gadget, Gizmo, PKDGrav, and Ramses. Unlike previous comparisons focused on summary statistics, we conduct a comprehensive field-level analysis: evaluating statistical similarity, quantifying implications for cosmological parameter inference, and identifying the regimes in which simulations are consistent. We begin with a traditional comparison using the power spectrum, cross-correlation coefficient, and visual inspection of the matter field. We follow this with a statistical out-of-distribution (OOD) analysis to quantify distributional differences between simulations, revealing insights not captured by the traditional metrics. We then perform field-level simulation-based inference (SBI) using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), training on one simulation and testing on others, including a full hydrodynamic simulation for comparison. We identify several causes of OOD behavior and biased inference, finding that resolution effects, such as those arising from adaptive mesh refinement (AMR), have a significant impact. Models trained on non-AMR simulations fail catastrophically when evaluated on AMR simulations, introducing larger biases than those from hydrodynamic effects. Differences in resolution, even when using the same N-body code, likewise lead to biased inference. We attribute these failures to a CNN's sensitivity to small-scale fluctuations, particularly in voids and filaments, and demonstrate that appropriate smoothing brings the simulations into statistical agreement. Our findings motivate the need for careful data filtering and the use of field-level OOD metrics, such as PQMass, to ensure robust inference.

 - **Abstract**
 The Sun was born in a clustered environment with 10,000 other stars. Being an isolated star today, the Sun must have left the nest. We do not directly know when that happened, how violent the ejection was, or how far the Solar siblings have drifted apart. The mass of the fragile outer Opic-Oort cloud, (between $r_{\rm inner} \sim 30,000$\,au and $200\,000$au from the Sun) and the orbital distribution of planetesimals in the inner Hills-Oort cloud (between $\sim 1000$\,au and $\sim 30\,000$ au) are sensitive to the dynamical processes involving the Sun in the parent cluster. We aim at understanding the extend to which observing the Oort cloud constrains the Sun's birth environment. This is achieved by a combination of theoretical arguments and N-body simulations. We show that the current mass of the Opic-Oort cloud (between 0.2 and $2.0$ Earth masses) is best explained if the Sun left the nest within $\sim 20$\,Myr after the giant planets formed and migrated. As a consequence, the possible dynamical encounter with another star carving the Kuiper belt, the Sun's abduction of Sedna, and other perturbations induced by nearby stars then must have happened shortly after the giant planets in the Solar system formed, but before the Sun left the parent cluster. Signatures of the time spend in the parent cluster must still be visible in the outer parts of the Solar system today. The strongest constraints will be the discovery of a population of relatively low-eccentricity ($e < 0.9$) inner Oort-cloud (but $500 < a < 10^4$\,au) objects.

 - **Abstract**
 We develop a multipole analysis method for images with a circular boundary, then apply it to supernova remnant (SNR) images. The morphology of SNR images is related to several factors, including the inhomogeneities of the supernova ejecta and of the circumstellar medium in which the ejecta and shock wave travel. The current multipole method corrects some errors in a previously presented method, and applies the new analysis to test for differences in X-ray image morphology between Type Ia and core-collapse type SNRs. We find there is no clear difference between the two SNR types in morphology as measured by multipole moments.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the 0.6--12-micron spectrum of Cha\,1107-7626, a 6-10 Jupiter-mass free-floating object in the $\sim$2\,Myr-old Chamaeleon-I star-forming region, from observations with the NIRSpec and MIRI instruments onboard the James Webb Space Telescope. We confirm that Cha\,1107-7626 is one of the lowest-mass objects known to harbor a dusty disk with infrared excess emission at wavelengths beyond 4 microns. Our NIRSpec data, and prior ground-based observations, provide strong evidence for ongoing accretion through Hydrogen recombination lines. In the mid-infrared spectrum, we detect unambiguously emission lines caused by methane (CH$_\mathrm{4}$) and ethylene (C$_\mathrm{2}$H$_\mathrm{4}$) in its circum-substellar disk. Our findings mean that Cha 1107-7626 is by far the lowest-mass object with hydrocarbons observed in its disk. The spectrum of the disk looks remarkably similar to that of ISO-ChaI 147, a very low mass star with a carbon-rich disk that is 10 to 20 times more massive than Cha\,1107-7626. The hydrocarbon lines can be accounted for with a model assuming gas temperatures of a few hundred Kelvin in the inner disk. The obvious similarities between the spectra of a low-mass star and a planetary-mass object indicate that the conditions in the inner disks can be similar across a wide range of central object masses.
#### The dynamics of the parsec-scale jet in the neutrino blazar PKS 0735+178

 - **Abstract**
 Recent studies of individual track-like TeV-PeV IceCube neutrino events suggest that strongly jetted AGNs, blazars, can be plausible sources of extragalactic high-energy neutrinos. Although the broadband emission and neutrinos from such blazars can be modeled by hadronic jets with inverse Compton processes, various models show degeneracies. One of the reasons is the lack of high-resolution observations pinpointing the location and physical conditions of neutrino-emitting plasma. Here, we present a VLBI study of PKS 0735+178 that was recently associated with a high energy neutrino event IceCube-211208A (IC211208) as well as alerts from other neutrino observatories. We analyzed publicly available VLBA 15 and 43 GHz data of 0735+178 during 2020-2024, resolving the mas-scale jet and tracing its time evolution in flux and structure, before and after IC211208. We find significant enhancements in the radio flux density, apparent brightness temperature, and synchrotron opacity at 15-43 GHz of the VLBI nuclear region after IC211208, strengthening the temporal correlation between 0735+178 and IC211208. Furthermore, we find that the source ejected a new VLBI component C2 from the VLBI core before IC211208. C2 traveled further downstream at ~4.2c apparent speed, close to the historical maximum speed for this object. C2 then passed a subluminally moving feature in the jet C1 located at ~0.13 mas (~0.77 pc) downstream the core at the time of IC211208. The time of this apparent passage is statistically coincident with the time of IC211208 within 1sigma uncertainty, suggesting the location of this apparent passage to be a probable spatial origin of IC211208. We discuss the physical implications of these findings.

 - **Abstract**
 Research on the high-mass end of the initial mass function (IMF) has been limited due to a scarcity of samples. Recently, Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST), as the most efficient spectroscopic telescope, has provided new opportunities for related research. In this study, based on approximately 70,000 main-sequence early-type stars from the LAMOST survey, we investigated the IMF of Galactic field stars at the high-mass end (1.5 < M/Msun < 7.1). First, we derived the slope of the present-day mass function (PDMF), finding after correcting for selection effect in the observed sample. We then accounted for the effects of stellar evolution and unresolved binaries to correct the PDMF back to the IMF, resulting in {\alpha}ini = 2.70 - 2.82. Notably, we corrected both stellar evolution and unresolved binary effects simultaneously by using binary-Star evolution code, which enhances the robustness of our results. Additionally, we investigated how different mass-ratio (q) distributions of binaries and different star formation histories of the Milky Way impact the IMF. Finally, we tested samples across different spatial scales and found that {\alpha}ini may exhibit a decreasing trend as the spatial scale increases, which could be attributed to variations in metallicity.

 - **Abstract**
 The formation of double-decker filaments has long been an enigma in the field of solar physics. Using stereoscopic observations from the Solar Dynamics Observatory and the Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory, we show that the double-decker filament formed on 2013 August 30 resulted from the splitting of a braided magnetic flux rope. The splitting was driven by component magnetic reconnection between intertwined field lines, triggered by the rotational motion in a part of one filament footpoint. This mechanism, inferred from observed small jets, brightenings, and bidirectional mass flows, differs from the previous conclusion attributing filament splitting to magnetic reconnection between the legs of confining magnetic field lines within or above the filament. The splitting speed might be modulated by the reconnection speed, as evidenced by the correspondence between the filament's slow and fast rising phases and the intermittent and violent brightening stages. Following the splitting, the upper branch of the double-decker filament erupted as a coronal mass ejection (CME), giving rise to a GOES soft X-ray M1.2 flare. In conclusion, our observations present a new formation mechanism for double-decker filaments, and the subsequent partial eruption is likely attributable to the torus instability of the background coronal magnetic field. Moreover, the detection of small jets within the filament provides new insights into the role of component magnetic reconnection in localized coronal heating processes.
#### The JCMT BISTRO-3 Survey: Variation of magnetic field orientations on parsec and sub-parsec scales in the massive star-forming region G28.34+0.06

 - **Abstract**
 Magnetic fields play a significant role in star-forming processes on core to clump scales. We investigate magnetic field orientations and strengths in the massive star-forming clump P2 within the filamentary infrared dark cloud G28.34+0.06 using dust polarization observations made using SCUBA-2/POL-2 on the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope as part of the B-field In STar-forming Region Observations (BISTRO) survey. We compare the magnetic field orientations at the clump scale of ~2 parsecs from these JCMT observations with those at the core scale of ~0.2 parsecs from archival ALMA data, finding that the magnetic field orientations on these two different scales are perpendicular to one another. We estimate the distribution of magnetic field strengths, which range from 50 to 430 {\mu}G over the clump. The region forming the core shows the highest magnetic field strength. We also obtain the distribution of mass-to-flux ratios across the clump. In the region surrounding the core, the mass-to-flux ratio is larger than 1, which indicates the magnetic field strength is insufficient to support the region against gravitational collapse. Therefore, the change in the magnetic field orientation from clump to core scales may be the result of gravitational collapse, with the field being pulled inward along with the flow of material under gravity.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a new stellar dynamical measurement of the supermassive black hole (SMBH) in the compact elliptical galaxy NGC 4486B, based on integral field spectroscopy with JWST/NIRSpec. The two-dimensional kinematic maps reveal a resolved double nucleus and a velocity dispersion peak offset from the photometric center. Utilizing two independent methods-Schwarzschild orbit-superposition and Jeans Anisotropic Modeling-we tightly constrain the black hole mass by fitting the full line-of-sight velocity distribution. Our axisymmetric Schwarzschild models yield a best-fit black hole mass of $M_{BH} = 3.6^{+0.6}_{-0.6} \times 10^8 \, M_{\odot}$, slightly lower but significantly more precise than previous estimates. However, since our models do not account for the non-equilibrium nature of the double nucleus, this value may represent a lower limit. The inferred black hole mass corresponds to approximately 4-13% of the total stellar mass, providing robust evidence for an overmassive SMBH in NGC 4486B. Combined with the galaxy's location deep within the Virgo Cluster, our results support the interpretation that NGC 4486B is the tidally stripped remnant core of a formerly massive galaxy. As the JWST/NIRSpec field of view is insufficient to constrain the dark matter halo, we incorporate archival ground-based long-slit kinematics extending to 5 arcsec. While this provides some leverage on the dark matter content, the constraints remain relatively weak. We place only an upper limit on the dark matter fraction, with $M_{DM}/M_{*} < 0.5$ within 1 kpc-well beyond the effective radius. The inferred black hole mass remains unchanged with or without a dark matter halo.

 - **Abstract**
 Water is detected in environments representing every stage of star and solar system formation, but its chemical evolution throughout these stages remains poorly constrained. Deuterium ratios offer a means of probing chemical links between water in different cosmic regions because of their sensitivity to physicochemical conditions. Here, we present the first detection of the 4.1 $\mu$m HDO ice feature with JWST toward L1527 IRS, an isolated low-mass protostar that may eventually grow to a sun-like mass. We measure an ice HDO/H$_{2}$O ratio of 4.4$^{+3.7}_{-1.7}$$\times$10$^{-3}$, where the reported error is dominated by uncertainties in continuum definition and ice band strengths. This fraction is similar to the gas HDO/H$_{2}$O ratios measured in the warm ($>$100 K) inner cores of other low-mass protostellar envelopes and protoplanetary disks found in comparably isolated star-forming regions. Such a similarity tentatively supports the assumption that water vapor detected in these regions is not significantly altered by gas-phase reactions following ice sublimation. It also supports the hypothesis that pre- and protostellar water ice is largely inherited in a chemically unaltered state by outer protoplanetary disks. However, the fraction is a factor of $\sim$4-10 times higher than the gas HDO/H$_{2}$O ratios measured toward comets and low-mass protostars in clustered star-forming regions. This difference may be due to either gas-phase water reprocessing in protostellar envelopes and protoplanetary disks, or differences between prestellar conditions of isolated dense cores and the clustered star-forming regions that are more analogous to the environment in which our Sun formed.

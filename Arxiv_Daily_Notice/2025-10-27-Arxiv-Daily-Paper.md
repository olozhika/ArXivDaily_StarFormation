 - **Abstract**
 In recent years, significant advances have been made in exoplanet and brown dwarf observations. By using state-of-the-art models, astronomers can determine properties of their atmospheres, such as temperatures, the presence of clouds, or the chemical abundances of molecules and atoms. Accurate and up-to-date opacities are crucial to avoid inconclusive or biased results, but it can be challenging to compute opacity cross-sections from the line lists provided by various online databases. We introduce pyROX, an easy-to-use Python package to calculate molecular and atomic cross-sections. Since pyROX works on CPUs, it can compute a small line list on a regular workstation, but it is also easily parallelised on a cluster for larger line lists. In addition to line opacities, pyROX also supports calculations of collision-induced absorption. Tutorials are provided in the online documentation which explain the configuration parameters and different functionalities of pyROX.

 - **Abstract**
 Context: Dust grains undergo significant growth in star-forming environments, especially in dense regions prone to gravitational collapse. Although dust is generally assumed to represent $1 \%$ of the gas mass, dust density variations are expected on small scales due to differential dynamics with the gas, leading to enhanced coagulation rates in regions of dust enrichment. Aims: We aim to investigate the clumping of charged dust in the turbulent magnetized dense regions of the interstellar medium. Methods: We develop a dusty model that goes beyond the standard non-ideal MHD and use the code {\ttfamily shark} to perform multifluid 1D simulations of a single size charged dust species and neutral gas with large scale driven turbulence and including ion-neutral friction. Results: We identify a mechanism similar to the parametric instability that efficiently forms dust clumps even in presence of dissipative processes. Such strong clumping survives and is sustained when driving turbulence, and thus high levels of dust concentration are produced due to compressive magnetic effects in regions of shocks. Dust density enhancements are favored by a high transverse-to-longitudinal magnetic ratio which is controlled by: transverse Mach number and plasma parameter. We find that a substantial fraction of dust experiences a density increase of more than a factor of 10 under reasonable conditions, thus promoting dust growth. Conclusion: Our novel dusty non-ideal MHD model shows that dust grains (main charge carriers) are subject to small-scale compressive magnetic effects driven by a parametric instability - like mechanism in regions of shocks, and consequently experience high density enhancements in turbulent environments that go beyond those permitted by pure hydrodynamical processes, making in-situ formation of large grains (sub-mm) in protostellar envelopes a plausible scenario.
#### It's always the quiet ones: Single Degenerate Double Detonation Type Ia Supernova from Quiescent Helium Accretion

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate a sub-Chandrasekhar mass double detonation pathway for Type Ia supernovae arising from single degenerate helium accreting carbon-oxygen white dwarfs. Building on our previous one dimensional study of recurrent helium novae (Hillman et al. 2025), we evolve a 0.7 solar mass white dwarf through steady accretion at 10^-8 Msun yr^-1 until it reaches 1.1 solar mass, yielding realistic, time evolved helium rich profiles. These profiles are mapped into FLASH simulations, incorporating nuclear burning for helium and carbon-oxygen detonation, in multi-dimensional hydrodynamic runs. A localized, modest temperature perturbation near the base of the helium shell robustly triggers an outward helium-shell detonation. The ensuing inward propagating shock converges in the carbon-oxygen core, igniting a secondary detonation that unbinds the star. We obtain a Ni56 yield of ~0.64 solar mass, an intermediate-mass element (Si-Ca) mass of ~0.41 solar mass, and maximum ejecta velocities approaching 22,000 km/s, values consistent with normal Type Ia supernovae. Our results demonstrate that recurrent helium accretors, typically quiescent over long timescales, can evolve under subtle, "quiet" conditions to trigger robust double detonations, supporting their role as viable progenitors of sub-Chandrasekhar mass Type Ia supernovae.

 - **Abstract**
 Icy interstellar dust grains are a source of complex organic molecule (COM) production, although their formation mechanisms are debated. Laboratory experiments show that atomic C deposited onto interstellar ice analogs can react with solid-phase NH3 to form a CHNH2 radical, a possible precursor to COMs, including aminoketene (NH2CHCO). We used astrochemical kinetics models to explore the role of the reaction of atomic C with NH3 and subsequent reaction with CO in the formation of NH2CHCO and other COMs. We applied the three-phase chemical model MAGICKAL to hot molecular core conditions from the cold-collapse through to the hot-core stage. The chemical network was extended to include NH2CHCO and a range of associated gas-phase, grain-surface, and bulk-ice products and reactions. We also approximated conditions in a shocked cloud, including sputtering of ice mantles. NH2CHCO is formed on grains at low temperatures (~10 K) with a peak solid-phase abundance of ~2x10^-10 nH. Its formation is driven by nondiffusive reactions, in particular the Eley-Rideal reaction of C with surface NH3, followed by immediate reaction with CO. Surface hydrogenation of NH2CHCO produces ethanolamine with a significant abundance of ~8x10^-8 nH. In the gas-phase, although ethanolamine reaches a modest abundance peak immediately following its desorption from grains under hot-core conditions, it is destroyed more rapidly due to its high proton affinity. Molecular survival is much higher in the shocked regions, where these species seem most likely to be detected. NH2CHCO is produced efficiently on simulated interstellar grain surfaces, acting subsequently as an important precursor to more complex organics, including ethanolamine and glycine. Ion-molecule gas-phase destruction of NH3-bearing COMs is less efficient in shocked lower-density regions, in contrast to hot cores, enhancing their abundances and lifetimes.

 - **Abstract**
 Observations by the SpectroPhotometer for the History of the Universe, Epoch of Reionization, and Ices Explorer (SPHEREx) are combined with Spitzer spectral map data to study the aromatic, aliphatic, and PAH size evolution across the northwest photo-dissociation region (PDR) of the Iris Nebula (NGC7023). The 3.3-3.4 $\mu$m complex (I$_{3.3}$) and 11.2 $\mu$m (I$_{11.2}$) PAH band strength are determined through direct integration. In addition, the former is decomposed into a 3.3 (I'$_{3.3}$) and 3.4 $\mu$m (I'$_{3.4}$) sub-feature by fitting SPHEREx bandpass-integrated photometry using a modeled, highly sampled, multi-component spectrum. I$_{3.3}$, I$_{11.2}$, I'$_{3.3}$, and I'$_{3.4}$ all peak at the PDR. The NASA Ames PAH IR Spectroscopic Database is used to obtain the average number of carbon atoms ($\overline{\rm N_{C}}$) and small PAH fraction ($f_{\rm small}$) by fitting the isolated PAH component of the Spitzer segment; $70\lesssim\overline{N_{C}}\lesssim76$ and $0.24\lesssim\text{f}_{\rm small}\lesssim0.36$. I'$_{3.4}$/I'$_{3.4}$, I$_{11.2}$/I$_{3.3}$, $\overline{\rm N_{C}}$, and $f_{\rm small}$ all show a demarcation that matches the large-scale morphology of the region. For I'$_{3.3}$ and I'$_{3.4}$ this is reflected by two distinct trends when plotted against each other, one associated with the dense, the other with the diffuse medium; $[N_{\rm H,ali}/N_{\rm H,aro}]_{\rm dense}$ = 0.49$\pm$0.01 and $[N_{\rm H,ali}/N_{\rm H,aro}]_{\rm diffuse}$ = 0.090$\pm$0.005. $\overline{\rm N_{C}}$ and $f_{\rm small}$ are tentatively correlated with I$_{11.2}$/I$_{3.3}$ (R=0.53$\pm$0.04 and -0.45$\pm$0.04, respectively). A wider variety of large(r) extended interstellar medium objects is required to tighten the correlations, turn them into quantitative calibrators for PAH size, and pin down the discrepancy of correlations with I'$_{3.3}$ involved.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first experimental evidence for in-ice Askaryan radiation -- coherent charge-excess radio emission -- from high-energy particle cascades developing in the Antarctic ice sheet. In 208 days of data recorded with the phased-array instrument of the Askaryan Radio Array, a previous analysis has incidentally identified 13 events with impulsive radiofrequency signals originating from below the ice surface. We here present a detailed reanalysis of these events. The observed event rate, radiation arrival directions, signal shape, spectral content, and electric field polarization are consistent with in-ice Askaryan radiation from cosmic ray air shower cores impacting the ice sheet. For the brightest events, the angular radiation pattern favors an extended cascade-like emitter over a pointlike source. An origin from the geomagnetic separation of charges in cosmic ray air showers is disfavored by the arrival directions and polarization. Considering the arrival angles, timing properties, and the impulsive nature of the passing events, the event rate is inconsistent with the estimation of the combined background from thermal noise events and on-surface events at the level of $5.1\,\sigma$.

 - **Abstract**
 Far-Ultraviolet (FUV) halos have been detected around six bright stars by Murthy and Henry (2011) using GALEX observations. These halos are thought to be caused by forward scattering of the starlight by dust grains present in thin foreground clouds. The optical constants of grains producing such halos have been constrained earlier by using a single scattering model, that considered the Henyey-Greenstein empirical phase function instead of theoretical phase functions for the scattering grains. In this work, we have modelled the FUV halos for two stars, Spica and Achernar, by considering the realistic porous aggregates of different sizes and compositions. As the Henyey-Greenstein phase function is known to deviate from theoretical predictions, we have utilized theoretical scattering phase functions for modelling. The dust is placed in a double-layered plane-parallel sheet with its distance and optical depth varied to get the best fit. We find that the halo intensities are dominated by scattering due to 0.05 {\mu}m sized porous dust aggregates made of amorphous silicate and carbonaceous aggregates for Spica and Achernar, respectively. We find that the medium in front of Achernar has a lower optical depth ({\tau}) of 0.032 compared to Spica which has a value of {\tau} = 0.1. This low value is close to the optical depth of the local ISM (0.01) within 40 pc of the Sun. This study demonstrates an effective method to constrain the dust grain properties in the local interstellar medium.
#### 3D Synthetic Convective Velocity Fields to Initialise Core-Collapse Supernova Simulations from 1D Progenitors

 - **Abstract**
 Core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) are among the most energetic and complex astrophysical phenomena, requiring threedimensional (3D) simulations to capture their intricate explosion mechanisms. One of the key ingredients for such simulations is the 3D pre-collapse structure, which can impact the development and geometry of the subsequent explosion. While stellar convection simulations can provide such 3D initial conditions, these remain too expensive and demanding for widespread use. In this work, we present a method to generate synthetic 3D velocity fields for convective zones from 1D initial conditions, creating initial conditions for CCSN simulations using a vector spherical harmonics expansion without the need for expensive hydrodynamic progenitor simulations. The synthetic velocity field is designed to capture the typical scales and velocities of the convective flow as the most relevant parameters for the subsequent explosions. In addition, it respects relevant physical constraints such as the near-anelasticity of flow, vanishing radial vorticity, and zero net angular momentum in the convective zones. A Python implementation of this method is publicly available, offering the CCSN community a practical tool for generating synthetic velocity fields for multi-dimensional simulations to study the impact of 3D progenitor asymmetries on the CCSN mechanism.

#### Impulsive mixing of stellar populations in dwarf spheroidal galaxies
 - **Authors:** Raphaël Errani, Matthew G. Walker, Simon Rozier, Jorge Peñarrubia, Julio F. Navarro

 - **Abstract**
 We study the response of mono-energetic stellar populations with initially isotropic kinematics to impulsive and adiabatic changes to an underlying dark matter potential. Half-light radii expand and velocity dispersions decrease as enclosed dark matter is removed. The details of this expansion and cooling depend on the time scale on which the underlying potential changes. In the adiabatic regime, the product of half-light radius and average velocity dispersion is conserved. We show that the stellar populations maintain centrally isotropic kinematics throughout their adiabatic evolution, and their densities can be approximated by a family of analytical radial profiles. Metallicity gradients within the galaxy flatten as dark matter is slowly removed. In the case of strong impulsive perturbations, stellar populations develop power-law-like density tails with radially biased kinematics. We show that the distribution of stellar binding energies within the dark matter halo substantially widens after an impulsive perturbation, no matter the sign of the perturbation. This allows initially energetically separated stellar populations to mix, to the extent that previously chemo-dynamically distinct populations may masquerade as a single population with large metallicity and energy spread. Finally, we show that in response to an impulsive perturbation, stellar populations that are deeply embedded in cored dark matter halos undergo a series of damped oscillations before reaching a virialised equilibrium state, driven by inefficient phase mixing in the harmonic potentials of cored halos. This slow return to equilibrium adds substantial systematic uncertainty to dynamical masses estimated from Jeans modeling or the virial theorem.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the luminosity function and volumetric rate of a sample of Type IIP supernovae (SNe) from the Zwicky Transient Facility Census of the Local Universe survey (CLU). This is the largest sample of Type IIP SNe from a systematic volume-limited survey to-date. The final sample includes 330 Type IIP SNe and 36 low-luminosity Type II (LLIIP) SNe with $M_{\textrm{r,peak}}>-16$ mag, which triples the literature sample of LLIIP SNe. The fraction of LLIIP SNe is $19^{+3}_{-4}\%$ of the total CLU Type IIP SNe population ($8^{+1}_{-2}\%$ of all core-collapse SNe). This implies that while LLIIP SNe likely represent the fate of core-collapse SNe of $8-12$ \Msun\ progenitors, they alone cannot account for the fate of all massive stars in this mass range. To derive an absolute rate, we estimate the ZTF pipeline efficiency as a function of the apparent magnitude and the local surface brightness. We derive a volumetric rate of $(3.9_{-0.4}^{+0.4}) \times 10^{4}\ \textrm{Gpc}^{-3}\ \textrm{yr}^{-1}$ for Type IIP SNe and $(7.3_{-0.6}^{+0.6}) \times 10^{3}\ \textrm{Gpc}^{-3}\ \textrm{yr}^{-1}$ for LLIIP SNe. Now that the rate of LLIIP SNe is robustly derived, the unresolved discrepancy between core-collapse SN rates and star-formation rates cannot be explained by LLIIP SNe alone.
#### Application of Machine Learning to Identify Radio Pulses of Air Showers at the South Pole (ARENA 2024)
 - **Authors:** Frank G. Schroeder, Abdul Rehman (for the IceCube Collaboration)
 - **Subjects:** Subjects:
Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE)
 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19931

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.19931

 - **Abstract**
 Machine learning is a useful tool for identifying radio pulses from cosmic-ray air showers and for cleaning such pulses from radio background. This can lower the detection threshold and increase the accuracy for the pulse time and amplitude. We have trained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) using CoREAS simulations and background recorded by a prototype station at the IceTop surface array at the South Pole and have applied them to air-shower measurements by this station. The station consists of 3 SKALA antennas and 8 scintillators, which are used to trigger the readout of the antennas upon a sixfold coincidence. Afterwards, the radio signal is filtered to the band of 70-350 MHz. By applying neural networks to search for radio signals in about four months of data, we find about five times more events than by a traditional method based on a signal-to-noise ratio cut after filtering for radio frequency interferences. Despite the lower threshold, the purity of the selected events seems to improve, and the angular resolution of the radio measurements does not deteriorate, which we have confirmed by a comparison of the reconstructed shower direction with IceTop. This analysis thus provides experimental confirmation that neural networks can indeed be used to clean air-shower radio signals from background and to lower the radio detection threshold of hybrid arrays combining particle and radio detectors.
#### Dynamic Photometric Variability in Three Young Brown Dwarfs in Taurus: Detection of Optical Flares with TESS data

 - **Abstract**
 We present $I$-band time-series photometric variability studies of three known nearby ($\sim$ 140 pc) and young ( $\sim$ 1 Myr) brown dwarfs (BD) in the Taurus star-forming region in the Perseus Molecular Cloud. From 10 nights of observations over a time span of 10 years, with a typical run of 3 to 6 hours each night, we estimated that the BDs show unstable short-scale periodicity from 1.5 to 4.8 hours. Using the long-term photometry from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), we have conducted a time-resolved variability analysis of CFHT-BD-Tau 3 and CFHT-BD-Tau 4, revealing orbital periods of $\sim$ 0.96 days and $\sim$ 3 days respectively, consistent with earlier studies. We also found two superflares in TESS sector 43 data for CFHT-BD-Tau 4 and estimated the flare energies as $7.09\times10^{35}$ erg and $3.75\times10^{36}$ erg. A magnetic field of $\sim3.39 ~kG$ is required to generate such flare energies on this BD. We performed spot modelling analysis on CFHT-BD-Tau 3 and CFHT-BD-Tau 4 to address the variability detected in the data using the package BASSMAN. Spectral energy distribution and infrared colours of the sources suggest that they have a sufficient amount of circumstellar material around them.
#### On Bactrian glitch-size distributions

 - **Abstract**
 A glitch is a rare and sudden increase in the otherwise steadily decreasing rotation rate of a pulsar. Its cause is widely attributed to the transfer of angular momentum to the crust of the star from the array of superfluid vortices enclosed within. The magnitude of such an increase defines the size of the glitch. The distribution of glitch sizes in individual pulsars, the power-law being the most argued for, is shrouded in uncertainty due to the small sample size. From a Bayesian perspective, we revisit the data for PSR J0537-6910, the pulsar with the most glitches, and find a bimodality in the distribution, reminiscent of the Bactrian camel. To understand this bimodality, we use a superfluid vortex simulator and study three independent neutron star paradigms: (i) Annular variation in pinning strength to account for the predicted differences between the crust and the core; (ii) Sectorial triggers to mimic local disturbances; and (iii) Stress-waves to model global disturbances. We find that annular variation in pinning introduces a bimodality in the glitch-size distribution and that sectorial triggers do so weakly. Stress-waves do not lead to any such features for the range of parameters tested. This provides us with new insights into the effects of various perturbations on the vortex dynamics and the glitch statistics of neutron stars.
#### The COSMOS-Web ring: Spectroscopic confirmation of the background source at z = 5.1

 - **Abstract**
 We report the spectroscopic confirmation of the background source of the most distant Einstein ring known to date, the COSMOS-Web ring. This system consists of a complete Einstein ring at $z=5.1$, lensed by a massive early-type galaxy at $z\sim2$. The redshift $z=5.1043\pm0.0004$ is unambiguously identified with our NOEMA and Keck/MOSFIRE spectroscopy, where the NOEMA observations reveal the CO(4-3) and CO(5-4) lines at $>8\,\sigma$, and the MOSFIRE data detect [O\textsc{ii}] at $\sim 6\,\sigma$. Using multi-wavelength photometry spanning near-infrared to radio bands, we find that the lensed galaxy is a dust-obscured starburst ($M_{\star} \sim 1.8\times10^{10}\,{\rm M_{\odot}}$, ${\rm SFR_{IR}\sim 60\,{\rm M_{\odot}} ~yr^{-1}}$) with high star-formation efficiency (gas depletion time $\tau_{\rm dep}<100~$Myr) as indicated by the [C\textsc{i}](1-0) non-detection. The redshift confirmation revalidates that the total lens mass budget within the Einstein radius is fully accounted for by the stellar and dark matter components, without the need of modifying the initial mass function or dark matter distribution profile. This work paves the way for detailed studies and future follow-ups of this unique lensing system, providing an ideal laboratory for studying mass distribution at $z\sim2$ and physical conditions of star formation at $z\sim5$.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper we study the behavior of test particles on top of a galactic-type of Fuzzy Dark Matter (FDM) structure, characterized by the core-halo density profile found in simulations. Our workhorse structure is an anisotropic, time-dependent, virialized core-tail FDM clump resulting from a multicore merger. For our analysis we allow this structure to keep evolving, which implies that the core oscillates and accretes matter from the halo, while the halo dynamics is dominated by its characteristic high kinetic energy. On top of this time-dependent structure that in turn has a time-dependent gravitational potential, we solve the motion equations of test particles with initial conditions associated to circular orbits at different radii. Our results indicate that: 1) no trajectory remains circular, 2) the trajectories are sensitive to initial conditions and 3) the departure of initially near trajectories has always a positive Lyapunov exponent. A qualitative result is that the motion of test particles is more erratic with a bigger Lyapunov exponent within and near the core than in the halo region, which can be understood in terms of the random motion of the core within the core-halo structure. We expect these results warn on the importance of the anisotropic and time-dependent nature of FDM clumps when studying the motion of test particles.

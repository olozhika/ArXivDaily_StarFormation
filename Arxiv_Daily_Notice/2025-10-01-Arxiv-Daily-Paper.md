 - **Abstract**
 We present the implementation and testing of a subgrid non-explosive pre-supernova (NEPS) feedback module for the COLIBRE model of galaxy formation. The NEPS module incorporates three key physical processes sourced by young, massive stars that act immediately following star formation: momentum injection from stellar winds and radiation pressure, and thermal energy from photoheating in HII regions. The age- and metallicity-dependent energy and momentum budgets are derived from BPASS stellar population models and are coupled self-consistently to the local gas properties. We test the model using a suite of smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations of isolated, unstable gaseous disks at various numerical resolutions (gas particle masses in the range $10^4-10^6$ $\rm M_{\odot}$). We find that the NEPS module successfully regulates star formation by providing pressure support that prevents catastrophic gas collapse. This regulation improves the numerical convergence of star formation rates and disk structure. In our model, feedback from HII regions is the dominant regulatory mechanism. Furthermore, we demonstrate a crucial synergy with subsequent supernova feedback; NEPS feedback pre-processes the interstellar medium, creating a more homogeneous environment that moderates the effect of explosive feedback from supernova events. Our NEPS module thus provides a physically motivated and numerically robust framework that mitigates resolution-dependent artefacts and promotes self-regulated galaxy growth.

 - **Abstract**
 Early light curves of many core-collapse supernovae (SNe) are thought to be powered by the interaction of the shock wave with optically thick extended material, either a bound envelope or preexplosion ejected circumstellar matter (CSM). We analytically analyze the early emission produced by a shock with velocity $v$ traversing a material of mass $M_\mathrm{e}$ and opacity $\kappa$ extending to radius $R_\mathrm{e}$, and show the emission varies qualitatively with varying $\tau_\mathrm{e}=\kappa\!M_\mathrm{e}/(4\pi\!R_\mathrm{e}^2)$: For $\tau_\mathrm{e}\gg\!c/v$ a shock breakout occurs near $R_\mathrm{e}$ producing an ``edge breakout"- a UV-dominated breakout burst followed by ``cooling emission" of the shock-heated material; for $\tau_\mathrm{e}\lesssim\!c/v$ a ``wind breakout" occurs- the breakout pulse is prolonged and followed by extended emission shifting from UV to X-ray as the shock becomes collisionless. We derive the dependence on $\{v,\kappa,M_\mathrm{e},R_\mathrm{e}\}$ of the duration and luminosity characterizing the different emission phases, and show that current observations typically do not allow inference of all parameters. In particular, since the optical bands lie in the Rayleigh-Jeans tail of radiation emitted during the cooling phase, the observed cooling luminosity depends weakly on radius, $\propto\!R_\mathrm{e}^{1/4}$, leading to $1-2$ orders of magnitude uncertainty in its inferred value. This suggests, e.g., that the common day-scale light curve features in Stripped-Envelope SNe do not necessarily imply material extending to $R_\mathrm{e}\sim10^3\!R_\odot$ and are often consistent with low-mass $R_\mathrm{e}\sim\!10^2\!R_\odot$ bound envelopes. Early multiband coverage (especially in UV/X-ray) can break these degeneracies; the forthcoming \emph{ULTRASAT} UV mission will allow inferring the properties of extended material around the population of SNe progenitors.
#### Seeking Kinematic Association of Known FU Orionis Stars with Young Clusters in Cygnus

 - **Abstract**
 Kinematic studies of young stars and star clusters have increased our understanding of the process of star formation and evolution in the Milky Way. FU Orionis objects are a specific class of young stellar object notable for their extremely high disk-to-star accretion rates. We use parallax and proper motion information from the Gaia astrometric survey to study five known FU Ori stars towards the Cygnus clouds, in the distance range ~500-900 parsecs, and seek evidence of their kinematic association with proximal stellar groups or clusters. We develop multiple search criteria within the Gaia datasets to look for nearby stellar aggregates and to reliably isolate their likely member stars. We show that V1057 Cygni and HBC 722 are kinematically consistent with the 3D locations as well as the inferred proper motion fields of the North America Nebula cluster. We show a similar association of V1515 Cygni with NGC 6914 in the Cygnus-X region, and of V2494 Cygni with stars in the dark cloud LDN 1003 and Braid Nebula. Further, we find that V1735 Cygni is consistent in both position and proper motion with the streamer structure of IC 5146, and we trace the streamer's similar proper motions to the main cluster. Color-magnitude diagrams of all identified clusters show the presence of pre-main-sequence populations, strengthening the likelihood of a physical association between the young FU Ori stars and their respective nearby clusters.

 - **Abstract**
 The distribution of binary black hole (BBH) masses and its evolution with redshift provide key insights into the different formation channels of the compact objects and their evolution with cosmic time and stellar properties such stellar metallicity and star formation rate history. We present a non parametric, model-independent joint reconstruction of the redshift evolution of BBH mass distribution from gravitational wave (GW) catalog GWTC-4.0 from the fourth observation of LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK). This method simultaneously searches for the signature of any linear and quadratic redshift evolution with respect to the low redshift in a Bayesian framework taking into accounting the detector selection effects. We find tentative evidence for a linear redshift-dependent evolution of the mass distribution, consistent over a mass range ($m \gtrsim 50\,M_\odot$). While lower mass systems shows no signature of evolution. The quadratic term remains consistent with zero, indicating that a simple linear dependence adequately describes the population up to redshift $z \sim 1$. In future with more GW sources, this technique can shed light into the true nature of the redshift dependence and possibility to uncover subtle evolutionary features in BBH populations and to probe the cosmic history of black hole formation.

 - **Abstract**
 Redshifted self-absorption features in molecular lines are commonly interpreted as signatures of gravitational collapse in pre- and protostellar cores. The shape of the line profile then encodes information on the dynamics of the collapse. There exist well-established observational techniques to estimate infall velocities from these profiles, but these have historically been calibrated on constant-velocity slab models, whereas more realistic simulations of gravitational collapse produce highly non-uniform radial velocity profiles. We produce synthetic line observations of a simulated collapsing prestellar core, including a treatment of the time-dependent chemical evolution. Applying observational techniques to the synthetic line profiles, we find that the estimated infall velocities are significantly and systematically lower than the mass-weighted infall velocities from the simulation. This is primarily because the self-absorption features tend to originate from the outer regions of the core, well beyond the location of the peak infall velocity. Velocities and mass accretion rates measured via these techniques are likely to underestimate the true values.

 - **Abstract**
 With the launch of the James Webb Space Telescope, we are firmly in the era of exoplanet atmosphere characterization. Understanding exoplanet spectra requires atmospheric chemical and climate models that span the diversity of planetary atmospheres. Here, we present a more general chemical and climate model of planetary atmospheres. Specifically, we introduce the open-source, one-dimensional photochemical and climate code Photochem, and benchmark the model against the observed compositions and climates of Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter and Titan with a single set of kinetics, thermodynamics and opacities. We also model the chemistry of the hot Jupiter exoplanet WASP-39b. All simulations are open-source and reproducible. To first order, Photochem broadly reproduces the gas-phase chemistry and pressure-temperature profiles of all six planets. The largest model-data discrepancies are found in Venus's sulfur chemistry, motivating future experimental work on sulfur kinetics and spacecraft missions to Venus. We also find that clouds and hazes are important for the energy balance of Venus, Earth, Mars and Titan, and that accurately predicting aerosols with Photochem is challenging. Finally, we benchmark Photochem against the popular VULCAN and HELIOS photochemistry and climate models, finding excellent agreement for the same inputs; we also find that Photochem simulates atmospheres 2 to 100 time more efficiently. These results show that Photochem provides a comparatively general description of atmospheric chemistry and physics that can be leveraged to study Solar System worlds or interpret telescope observations of exoplanets.
#### On the shape of pancakes: catastrophe theory and Gaussian statistics in 2D

 - **Abstract**
 Cold dark matter (CDM) can be thought of as a 2D (or 3D) sheet of particles in 4D (or 6D) phase-space due to its negligible velocity dispersion. The large-scale structure, also called the cosmic web, is thus a result of the topology of the CDM manifold. Initial crossing of particle trajectories occurs at the critical points of this manifold, forming singularities that seed most of the collapsed structures. The cosmic web can thus be characterized using the points of singularities. In this context, we employ catastrophe theory in 2D to study the motion around such singularities and analytically model the shape of the emerging structures, particularly the pancakes, which later evolve into halos and filaments-the building blocks of the 2D web. We compute higher-order corrections to the shape of the pancakes, including properties such as the curvature and the scale of transition from their C to S shape. Using Gaussian statistics (with the assumption of Zeldovich flow) for our model parameters, we also compute the distributions of observable features related to the shape of pancakes and their variation across halo and filament populations in 2D cosmologies. We find that a larger fraction of pancakes evolve into filaments, they are more curved if they are to evolve into halos, are dominantly C-shaped, and the nature of shell-crossing is highly anisotropic. Extending this work to 3D will allow testing of predictions against actual observations of the cosmic web and searching for signatures of non-Gaussianity at corresponding scales.

 - **Abstract**
 Magnetic fields influence the structure and evolution of protostellar systems, thus understanding their role is essential for probing the earliest stages of star formation. We present ALMA Band 3 and 6 polarized continuum observations at $\sim$0.5$^{\prime \prime}$ resolution toward the Class 0 protostellar system HH 211. Three dust filaments ($\sim$4000 au in length) are found in the HH 211 protostellar envelope, two of which are aligned with core-scale ($\sim$10,000 au) magnetic fields detected by previous JCMT observations. This result suggests that the formation of the dust filaments may be influenced by magnetic fields. In the inner envelope ($\sim$1000 au), we detect a clear hourglass-shaped magnetic field morphology near the protostar and toroidal fields along the outflow directions. We also estimate the line-of-sight-averaged temperature and column density distributions in the inner envelope and find that the temperature is higher in the east, while the column density is enhanced in the southern and western regions. The southern dense regions of the inner envelope may trace either outflow cavity walls, due to their alignment with the outflow, or possible infalling channels in the midplane, given the close correspondence between the observed magnetic fields and the predicted infall trajectories.
#### Revisiting the Atmosphere of HD 149026b: The Role of Stellar Abundances and Choice of Opacities in Exoplanet Atmosphere Modeling

 - **Abstract**
 Planet formation occurs within the same molecular cloud as the host star, suggesting a link between the elemental abundances of star and the planet. Exoplanet atmosphere studies often assume solar abundances for host stars, however, specific host star abundances might lead to more accurate constraints. In this work, we perform sensitivity studies for a metal rich stellar host HD 149026 and its exoplanet HD 149026b, to understand the effect of solar versus stellar abundance choice on the $P$-$T$ profiles, equilibrium chemical abundances and emission spectra, using self-consistent atmosphere models. We find that the differences are dependent on the model parameters, particularly C/O ratio, and for HD 149026b the difference in the eclipse depth is maximum $\sim$80 ppm, for C/O between 0.75-0.85. Recent JWST NIRCam observations of HD 149026b have yielded widely varying metallicity ranges, highly super-solar (59-275$\times$) using chemical equilibrium retrievals and 12-31$\times$ solar using self-consistent models, both using solar abundances. In this work, we constrain the metallicity of HD 149026b to be 53-113$\times$ solar, with solar abundances and 39-78$\times$ stellar, with stellar abundances. We constrain the self-consistent $P$-$T$ profile of HD 149026b to be substantially cooler (upto 500 K) than the self-consistent best-fit model in the previous work, in the emission spectra probed region, thus requiring higher CO$_2$ abundance to explain the observations, leading to comparatively higher metallicity constraint. We find that the inclusion of Fe opacity in computing self-consistent $P$-$T$ profiles for HD 149026b in our models is the major reason for these differences. We constrain the C/O ratio to 0.47-0.68 and the heat redistribution factor to 0.70-0.76, indicating higher heat redistribution than previously estimated.

 - **Abstract**
 We present on results of a spatially resolved spectral analysis of G1.9+0.3, the youngest known supernova remnant in the Galaxy. The X-ray spectra are well described by synchrotron emission from a power-law electron distribution with an exponential cutoff. We found a cutoff energy $\epsilon_0 \sim 1 ~ \rm{keV}$ in both the radio bright rim and the X-ray bright rims. In the loss-limited case, the cutoff energy depends on the shock velocity $v_{\rm{sh}}$ and the Bohm factor $\eta$, following the relation $\epsilon_0 \propto v_{\rm{sh}}^2 \eta^{-1} $. Our analysis shows that $\eta$ ranges from 2 to 4 in the radio rim and from 12 to 15 in the X-ray rims. This suggests that the magnetic field in the radio rim is more turbulent than in the X-ray rims. The presence of CO clouds along the radio rim likely contributes to this difference. Interaction between the shock and these clouds can slow the shock down and generate turbulent eddies. The resulting turbulence eddies can amplify the magnetic field. We propose that the strong radio emission from the radio rim is primarily due to this amplified magnetic field. In contrast, a CO cloud located in the south-west appears to lie in the foreground, as indicated by its low turbulence and the absence of shock deceleration.

 - **Abstract**
 The abundance and mass function of primordial black holes (PBHs) are often estimated using the Press-Schechter (PS) formalism. In the case of halo formation, the PS formalism suffers from the miscounting of regions collapsing into halos, known as the cloud-in-cloud problem, which is usually corrected by introducing a multiplicative `fudge factor 2'. By analogy, this factor has sometimes been applied to PBH calculations, although its validity has remained unsettled. We reformulate the PS approach for PBHs within the excursion-set framework, where the smoothed density contrast undergoes a stochastic random walk as the smoothing scale varies and collapse is identified with the first threshold crossing. While the halo case is described by a Markovian process, we show that the PBH case is non-Markovian, even when the sharp-k filter Window function is adopted. Decomposing the total collapse probability into two distinct components of the stochastic motion, we numerically confirm that their contributions are exactly equal in the case of halo formation, justifying the fudge factor. For PBHs, however, we demonstrate that this equality no longer holds, and consistent inclusion of both contributions is essential to ensure a positive-definite mass function. Our results clarify the origin of the ambiguity surrounding the fudge factor and establish a robust theoretical foundation for PBH abundance calculations.
#### Time-Dependent obscuration of a tidal disruption event candidate in the active galactic nucleus CSS100217

 - **Abstract**
 CSS100217 is considered a peculiar tidal disruption event (TDE) candidate occurring in an active galactic nucleus (AGN). Unlike typical TDEs, where the post-flare luminosity is equal to that pre-flare, CSS100217 decayed to $\sim$ 0.4 magnitudes fainter than its pre-flare V band level. In this manuscript, we propose an obscured TDE model to explain the light curve of CSS100217. Assuming that the time-dependent obscuration, caused by the TDE unbound stellar debris, or by nuclear clouds moving around the supermassive black hole (SMBH), follows a Weibull distribution, we find that the light curve of CSS100217 can be described by the tidal disruption of a $4.6_{-0.9}^{+0.9}{\rm M_\odot}$ main-sequence star by a $3.3_{-0.3}^{+0.3}\times10^7{\rm M_\odot}$ black hole. The total energy of the event derived from our fit is $7.23\times10^{53}$ ergs and about 1.38 ${\rm M_\odot}$ of debris mass is accreted by the central SMBH. The model indicates that the contribution of the host galaxy to the observed pre-flare optical luminosity is not-significant compared to that of the AGN, which is consistent with the results of the spectral analysis. These results suggest that obscuration may play an important role in explaining the unusual TDE-like variability observed in CSS100217.

 - **Abstract**
 The $\Lambda$CDM model has long served as the cornerstone of modern cosmology, offering an elegant and successful framework for interpreting a wide range of cosmological observations. However, the rise of high-precision datasets has revealed statistically significant tensions, most notably the Hubble tension and the $S_8$ discrepancy, which challenge the completeness of this standard model. In this context, we explore the $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM model-an extension of $\Lambda$CDM featuring a single additional parameter, $z_\dagger$, corresponding to a sign-switching cosmological constant. This minimal modification aims to alleviate key observational tensions without compromising the model's overall coherence. Recent findings present in the literature indicate that the $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM model not only provides a better fit to Lyman-$\alpha$ forest data for $z_\dagger < 2.3$, but also accommodates both the SH0ES measurement of $H_0$ and the angular diameter distance to the last scattering surface when 2D BAO data are included. We present a comprehensive analysis combining the full Planck 2018 CMB data, the Pantheon Type Ia Supernovae sample, and the recently released Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). Our finding reveal that the Preliminary DESI results, a possible $3.9\sigma$ deviation from $\Lambda$CDM expectations, reinforce the importance of exploring such dynamic dark energy frameworks. In sum, our study underscores the potential of $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM to reconcile multiple cosmological tensions and sheds light on the role of upcoming high-precision observations in reshaping our understanding of the universe's expansion history and the nature of dark energy.

 - **Abstract**
 CTA~1 is a composite supernova remnant featuring a shell structure and an inner Pulsar Wind Nebula. The shell is visible in the radio band, while Fermi has detected the radio-quiet pulsar PSR J0007+7303 at its core. Gamma-ray detectors such as LHAASO and VERITAS have detected TeV emission in the vicinity of the pulsar. However, the derived SEDs from LHAASO WCDA and VERITAS show significant discrepancies, which could be due to a complicated energy-dependent morphology not accounted for in the spectral analysis, and different angular resolution of the two experiments. CTA~1 has been a target for dedicated observations by the SST-1M telescopes, a pair of small-sized Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs) capable of operating in both mono and stereo modes. Located at the Ondřejov Observatory in Czech Republic, these telescopes are sensitive to the high energy range of the gamma-ray spectrum, spanning from 1 to 300 TeV. To investigate the very high-energy emission of CTA~1, the SST-1Ms have accumulated approximately 30 hours of selected observations, aiming to further constrain the characteristics of the source's high energy emission, and to shed some light into the discrepancy between different experiments.
#### The twin red giant branch system BD+20 5391 A case study of low-mass double-core evolution

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding interactions of binary systems on the red giant branch is crucial to understanding the formation of compact stellar remnants such as helium-core white dwarfs (He-WDs) and hot subdwarfs. However, the detailed evolution of such systems, particularly those with nearly identical components, remains under-explored. We aim to analyse the double-lined spectroscopic binary system BD+20 5391, composed of two red giant stars, in order to characterise its orbital and stellar parameters and to constrain its evolution. Spectroscopic data were collected between 2020 and 2025 using the Ondřejov Echelle Spectrograph and the Mercator Échelle Spectrograph. The time-resolved spectra were fitted with models to determine the radial velocity curve and derive the system's parameters. We then used the position of both stars in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram to constrain the system's current evolutionary state, and we discuss potential outcomes of future interactions between the binary components. We find that the two stars in BD+20 5391 will likely initiate Roche lobe overflow (RLOF) simultaneously, leading to a double-core evolution scenario. The stars' helium core masses at RLOF onset will be almost identical, at 0.33 $\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$. This synchronised evolution suggests two possible outcomes: common envelope ejection, resulting in a short-period double He-WD binary, or a merger without envelope ejection. In the former case, the resulting double He-WD may merge later and form a hot subdwarf star. This study provides a valuable benchmark example for understanding the evolution of interacting red giant binaries, which will be discovered in substantial numbers in upcoming large-scale spectroscopic surveys.

 - **Abstract**
 We study the white dwarf (WD) cooling sequence of the Galactic Globular Cluster (GGC) NGC 2808 by using deep near-UV data from the Hubble Space Telescope and theoretical models, to investigate if this cluster hosts an excess of WDs. Excess in WDs is a rare phenomenon that has been found to exist only in a few GGCs. We compared star counts from different evolutionary phases on the near-UV color-magnitude diagram to evolutionary times predicted by BaSTI models. The investigation was carried out over a region within a radii of 1.5 $\arcmin$ of the cluster center and a region of similar dimension located 5$\arcmin$ away. We find a WD excess of $\approx$ 60 - 70\% when comparing star counts and evolutionary models of the WD cooling sequence to the main-sequence turn-off, and by using different values and fractions of Helium enhancement. This excess decreases to $\approx$ 30 - 40\% when the WD cooling sequence is compared to the horizontal branch. The WD excess is slightly larger in the internal field that covers the cluster center; however, the difference with the external field is compatible within the uncertainties. We argue that this excess is possibly related to the existence of SCWDs and Helium-core WDs in NGC~2808, and might be directly associated to the extended blue horizontal branch of this GGC.
#### Impact of near-degeneracy effects on linear rotational inversions for red-giant stars

 - **Abstract**
 Accurate estimates of internal red-giant rotation rates are a crucial ingredient for constraining and improving current models of stellar rotation. Asteroseismic rotational inversions are a method to estimate these internal rotation rates. In this work, we focus on the observed differences in the rotationally-induced frequency shifts between prograde and retrograde modes, which were ignored in previous works when estimating internal rotation rates of red giants using inversions. We systematically study the limits of applicability of linear rotational inversions as a function of the evolution on the red-giant branch and the underlying rotation rates. We solve for the oscillation mode frequencies in the presence of rotation in the lowest-order perturbative approach. This enables a description of the differences between prograde and retrograde modes through the coupling of multiple mixed modes. We compute synthetic rotational splittings taking these near-degeneracy effects into account. We use red-giant models with one solar mass, a large frequency separation between 16 and 9 microhertz and core rotation rates between 500 and 1500 nHz covering the regime of observed parameters of Kepler red-giant stars. Finally, we use these synthetic data to quantify the systematic errors of internal rotation rates estimated by means of rotational inversions in the presence of near-degeneracy effects. We show that the systematic errors in the estimated rotation rates introduced by near-degeneracy effects surpass observational uncertainties for more evolved and faster rotating stars. The estimated rotation rates of some of the previously analysed red giants suffer from significant systematic errors that have not been taken into account yet. Notwithstanding, reliable analyses with existing inversion methods are feasible for a number of red giants within the parameter ranges determined here.

 - **Abstract**
 Time-delay cosmography, by monitoring the multiply imaged gravitational lenses in the time domain, offers a promising and independent method for measuring cosmological distances. However, in addition to the main deflector that produces the multiple images, the large-scale structure along the line-of-sight (LoS) will also deflect the traveling light rays, known as weak lensing (WL). Due to resolution limitations, accurately measuring WL on arcsecond scales is highly challenging. In this work, we evaluate the LoS effects on both lensing images and time-delay measurements using a more straightforward, high-resolution N-body simulation that provides a more realistic matter distribution compared to the traditional, computationally cheaper halo rendering method. We employ the multi-plane ray tracing technique, which is traditionally utilized to compute WL effects at the arcminute scale, extending its application to the strong lensing regime at the arcsecond scale. We focus on the quadruple-image system and present the following findings: 1. In addition to a constant external convergence, large-scale structures within a region approximately 2 arcminutes in angular size act as external perturbers, inducing inhomogeneous fluctuations on the arcsecond scale; 2. These fluctuations cannot be fully accounted for by external shear alone, necessitating the inclusion of external flexion; 3. While incorporating flexion provides a reasonably good fit to the lensing image, the time-delay distance still exhibits a $6.2$\textperthousand~bias and a $2.5\%$ uncertainty. This underscores the limitations of the single-plane approximation, as time-delay errors accumulate along the LoS.

 - **Abstract**
 Dense neutrino systems, which display collectivity mediated by the weak interaction, have deep parallels with mean-field kinetic systems governed by other fundamental forces. We identify analogues in fast flavor conversion (FFC) of some time-honored nonlinear phenomena in plasmas and self-gravitating systems. We focus in particular on nonlinear Landau damping and collisionless equilibria, which are likely important pieces of the unsolved puzzle of neutrino oscillations in core-collapse supernovae and neutron star mergers. Our analysis additionally reveals the previously unexplored phenomenon of flavor-wave synchronization.

 - **Abstract**
 Exoplanetary systems with multiple giant planets present an opportunity to understand planet formation, migration processes, and long-term system-wide dynamical interactions. In particular, they provide constraints to distinguish between smooth disk-driven migration or more dynamically excited system evolution pathways. We report the discovery and characterization of a unique multi-planet system hosting three gas giant planets orbiting the post-main sequence star TOI-375. The innermost planet, TOI-375 b, was initially detected by the TESS mission and then confirmed with photometric follow-up observations conducted using MEarth and LCOGT, and radial velocity measurements obtained with FEROS and CHIRON. The radial velocity data revealed the presence of two additional planetary candidates, TOI-375 c and TOI-375 d. We find that TOI-375 b is a hot Jupiter with an orbital period of $9.45469 \pm 0.00002$ days, mass $0.745 \pm 0.053,M_\mathrm{J}$, radius $0.961 \pm 0.043, R_\mathrm{J}$, and eccentricity $0.087 \pm 0.042$. The outer two planets, TOI-375 c and TOI-375 d, are warm-cold and cold Jupiters with orbital periods of $115.5^{+2.0}_{-1.6}$ days and $297.9^{+28.9}_{-18.6}$ days, and minimum masses of $2.11 \pm 0.22, M_\mathrm{J}$ and $1.40 \pm 0.28, M_\mathrm{J}$, respectively. In terms of formation and overall system architecture, the physical properties of TOI-375 b are consistent with the core accretion scenario, while the current configuration of the system could be explained by both disk-driven and high-eccentricity migration scenarios. The discovery of TOI-375 as the first known system hosting three or more fully evolved gas giants, with at least one transiting planet, makes it an excellent candidate for testing formation and migration theories.

 - **Abstract**
 The outer Galaxy is characterized by a lower metallicity than regions near the Sun, suggesting differences in the formation and survival of molecules in star-forming regions. To understand chemical evolution across the Milky Way, deriving molecular abundances in star-forming regions in the outer Galaxy is essential for refining models of sub-Solar metallicity environments. We analyzed IRAM 30m observations at 3 and 2 mm toward 35 sources at Galactocentric distances of 9$-$24 kpc, within the "CHEMical complexity in star-forming regions of the outer Galaxy" (CHEMOUT) project. We focused on species with the highest detection rates (i.e., HCN, HCO$^+$, c-C$_3$H$_2$, H$^{13}$CO$^+$, HCO, SO) and searched for trends in column densities, abundances, and line widths with Galactocentric distance. Abundances for H$_2$CO and CH$_3$OH were updated using H$_2$ column densities from new NIKA2 dust maps. Fractional abundances relative to H$_2$ of most species (HCN, HCO$^+$, c-C$_3$H$_2$, HCO, H$_2$CO, CH$_3$OH) scale at most with the elemental carbon abundance ([C/H]) up to $\sim$24 kpc. SO shows a steeper gradient than sulfur abundance ([S/H]), while H$^{13}$CO$^+$ shows a shallower gradient than [$^{13}$C/H]. Gas turbulence, inferred from line widths, decreases with Galactocentric distance, suggesting a more quiescent environment in the outer Galaxy with respect to the inner Galaxy. In the outer Galaxy, the formation efficiency of most molecules, following the parent element availability, is comparable or higher (e.g., for H$^{13}$CO$^+$) than in the local Galaxy, whereas SO forms less efficiently. These results have significant implications for chemical models of the outermost star-forming regions and for understanding molecule formation under lower metallicity conditions.

 - **Abstract**
 We construct a generic X-ray spectral model for the reflection component from the clumpy torus and dusty gas in the polar region (polar dusty gas) in an active galactic nucleus (AGN), designated as Inclusive spectral energy distribution Model of Polar dust And Clumpy Torus for X-ray (IMPACTX). To calculate the spectra, we utilize the Monte-Carlo based, 3-dimensional radiative transfer code SKIRT. The adopted geometry is the same as that of the IMPACT model (Ogawa et al. in prep.), consisting of a clumpy torus defined by Nenkova et al. (2008) and paraboloid-shell polar dusty gas launched at the inner radius of the torus. We discuss the dependence of the X-ray spectrum on geometrical parameters in comparison with the conventional torus-only model (XCLUMPY). As an example, we have simultaneously applied the IMPACTX and IMPACT models to the X-ray and infrared spectra of the nearby Seyfert 2 galaxy NGC 4388, and have found a solution that can well reproduce both spectra. This demonstrates the importance of using both X-ray and infrared data to constrain the nuclear structure of an AGN.
#### DRAGNs in the Forest: Identifying Artifacts with Random Forest Models in the VLASS DRAGNs Catalog

 - **Abstract**
 The Quick Look data products from the Very Large Array Sky Survey (VLASS) contain widespread imaging artifacts arising from the simplified imaging algorithm used in their production. The catalog of double radio sources associated with active galactic nuclei (DRAGNs) found in the VLASS first epoch Quick Look release using the DRAGNhunter algorithm suffers from contamination from these artifacts. These sources contain two or three individual components, each of which can be an artifact. We train random forest models to classify these DRAGNs based on the number of artifacts they contain, ranging from zero to three artifacts. We optimize our models and mitigate the class imbalance of our dataset with judicious training set selection, and the best of our models achieves a weighted F1 score of $97.01\%^{+1.12\%}_{-1.32\%}$. Using our classifications, we produce a catalog of VLASS DRAGNs from which an estimated 99.3% complete catalog of 97.7% artifact-free sources can be extracted.
#### The transport of angular momentum for massive stars I. Formation of slowly rotating WNE stars
 - **Authors:** Jijuan Si, Yan Li, Xue-Feng Li, Zhi Li

 - **Abstract**
 The evolutionary scenario of early-type nitrogen-sequence Wolf-Rayet (WNE) stars predicts a slowly rotating subclass that typically forms after the red supergiant (RSG) phase. Their slow rotation rates are attributed to stellar winds that remove angular momentum transferred outward during core contraction. We incorporate improved prescriptions for internal gravity waves and the magnetic Tayler instability into single massive star evolution models. Our simulations successfully produce slowly rotating WNE stars and determine optimal parameters for both mechanisms ($A \ge 10$ for internal gravity waves (IGWs), $\alpha = 0.01$ for revised Tayler instability (TSF)). The results demonstrate that the efficiency of angular momentum transfer in massive stars is significantly enhanced compared to low-mass stars, both processes can self-consistently explain the slow rotation of WNE stars, confirming their efficiency in angular momentum redistribution and providing crucial theoretical support for the existence of this predicted stellar population.
#### Asteroseismology and Dynamics Reveal Interior Structure and Coeval Evolution in the Triply Post-Main-Sequence system DG Leo

 - **Abstract**
 $\delta$ Scuti stars in binary or multiple systems serve as crucial probes for studying stellar pulsation and evolution. However, many such systems are not ideal for asteroseismology due to uncertainties in mass transfer with close companions and the challenges of dynamically measuring all components' physical properties. The triple system DG~Leo, comprising an inner binary and a distant $\delta$ Scuti star, is an ideal target due to its well-separated pulsator. By combining new \textit{TESS} photometry with archival spectroscopy, our dynamical analysis shows that the system's three components share similar masses, radii, and luminosities within errors, occupying coincident Hertzsprung--Russell diagram positions, indicative of coeval evolution. By fitting seven observed $\delta$ Scuti frequencies through asteroseismic modeling with dynamically constrained theoretical grids, we simultaneously trace the pulsating star's evolution and constrain the triple system's evolutionary stage, with the derived fundamental parameters showing consistency with the dynamical solutions. Our analysis reveals that all three components of DG~Leo are in the post-main-sequence phase, with a system age of $0.7664^{+0.1402}_{-0.1258}$~Gyr. Additionally, the $\delta$ Scuti component shows multiple non-radial modes with significant mixed-character frequencies, providing precise constraints on its convective core extent ($R_{\mathrm{cz}}/R = 0.0562^{+0.0137}_{-0.0021}$).
#### A Near-Infrared and Optical Study of NGC 5822: An Open Cluster Hosting Barium-stars and Lithium-Enriched Giant Stars

 - **Abstract**
 We present a chemical abundance study of giant stars in the Galactic open cluster NGC 5822, which hosts two barium stars (#002 and #201) and three lithium-enriched giants (#006, #102, and #240). Using high-resolution optical and near-infrared ($H$ and $K$ band) spectra from FEROS and IGRINS, we determine atmospheric parameters and abundances for 23 elements (Li, C, N, O, F, Na, Mg, Al, Si, P, S, K, Ca, Sc, Ti, Cr, Fe, Ni, Y, Ce, Nd, Yb, and Pb). This includes species not yet studied in this cluster, such as F, P, K, Yb, and Pb, as well as oxygen isotopic ratios $^{16}$O/$^{17}$O and $^{16}$O/$^{18}$O. Membership was assessed using astrometry and chemical abundances, providing insight into the evolutionary stages of Li-enriched giants and cluster parameters (age, distance, extinction). However, the identification of Ba-stars remains challenging due to their binary nature and less reliable astrometric solutions. The cluster's abundances are broadly consistent with expectations for the Galactic thin disk. The mean fluorine abundance agrees with chemical evolution models predicting that young clusters (<2 Gyr) exhibit elevated [F/Fe], with production from SN II, SN Ia, AGB, and Wolf-Rayet stars. No distinct chemical or rotational features were found to explain the lithium enrichment, likely occurring either during the red clump phase or near the RGB tip. For the Ba-stars, nucleosynthesis models combined with the cluster's turn-off mass suggest polluting companion masses of 3.00 and 3.75 $M_{\odot}$ for stars #002 and #201. These results highlight the importance of open clusters as laboratories for chemically peculiar stars.

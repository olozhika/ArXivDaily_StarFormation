 - **Abstract**
 The microscopic composition of neutron star interiors remains uncertain, with possible scenarios including nucleonic matter, hyperonic matter, dark matter admixed cores, and strange self-bound matter. Traditional constraints on the equation of state rely on Tolman Oppenheimer Volkoff modelling and comparison with multimessenger observations, but machine learning provides a complementary pathway by learning composition dependent patterns directly from astrophysically accessible observables. This work presents a compact supervised learning framework for EOS family classification using stellar properties derived from TOV modelling, asteroseismology, and gravitational wave descriptors. A labelled dataset of neutron star configurations spanning four EOS families (nucleonic, strange matter, dark matter admixed, and hyperonic) is constructed using seven input features: gravitational mass, radius, fundamental f mode frequency, quadrupole moment, redshift, damping time, and characteristic strain. A multilayer perceptron is trained to infer the underlying matter composition. On a held out test set, the classifier achieves an accuracy of 97.4 percent with strong class wise precision and recall. Permutation based feature importance analysis shows that oscillation related quantities, especially the f mode frequency and damping time, dominate the discriminatory power, while mass and radius provide secondary support. Residual misclassifications occur in physically intuitive regions where different EOS families produce partially overlapping macroscopic signatures. These results show that lightweight neural models can reliably identify EOS family fingerprints from a modest set of observables, providing a reproducible baseline for future extensions incorporating Bayesian uncertainty and observational posteriors from NICER and gravitational wave events.

 - **Abstract**
 The Antarctic TianMu Staring Observation Program is a time-domain optical sky survey project carried out in Antarctica, capable of large sky coverage, high-cadence sampling, and long-period staring. It utilizes the exceptional observing conditions in Antarctica to conduct high-cadence time-domain sky surveys. At present, we have successfully developed an 18-cm aperture Antarctic TianMu prototype, which has been deployed at Zhongshan Station in Antarctica for two consecutive years of trouble-free observations, during which more than 300,000 original images were obtained. This paper systematically outlines the commissioning data of the prototype telescope in 2023, the primary data processing pipeline, and the preliminary data products. The core pipeline encompasses four key stages: Data preprocessing, instrumental effect correction, astrometric solution, and full-field stellar photometry. Here, we release the 2023 data products, which specifically include reduced image data and a photometric catalog, for which, preliminary analyses demonstrate robust performance. Using Gaia Data Release 3 as a reference catalog, the astrometric precision, quantified by the root mean square of positional errors, is determined to be better than approximately 2 arcseconds, validating the observational capabilities of the system. For a 30-second exposure, the detection limit in the G-band is achieved at 15.00~mag, with a detection threshold of 1.5~$\sigma$. The photometric errors are below 0.1~mag for the majority of stars brighter than 14.00~mag. Furthermore, it improves significantly, reaching better than 0.01~mag for most stars brighter than 11.00~mag and 12.00~mag when employing the adaptive aperture photometry and point spread function photometry methods, respectively.
#### SSC Radiation in the ICMART Model: Spectral Simulations and Application to the Record-Breaking GRB 221009A

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.24085

 - **Abstract**
 This paper presents simulations of the synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) spectrum within the Internal-Collision-induced Magnetic Reconnection and Turbulence (ICMART) model. We investigate how key parameters like the magnetization $\sigma_0$ shape the broadband spectral energy distribution by regulating the electron distribution and magnetic field strength. The overall spectrum typically comprises two components: synchrotron radiation peaking at $E_{\rm p}$ with a low-energy spectral index $\alpha$ between -1 and -1.5, and an SSC component peaking at $E_{\rm ssc}$. At high energies, Klein-Nishina suppression causes an exponential cutoff. The flux ratio Y between these components is critical: when Y is small, the SSC peak can be suppressed. Spectral features of the synchrotron component reveal the underlying physical conditions: harder spectra with $\alpha\sim-1$ indicate a large Y parameter and strong KN suppression. We find a positive correlation between Y and $\sigma_0$, contrasting with internal shock model predictions. Applied to GRB 221009A, our model suggests $\sigma_0\leq20$ can reproduce the MeV-TeV observations. This study underscores the value of combined MeV-TeV observations in probing GRB emission mechanisms.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a comprehensive long-term, multi-epoch spectral and timing study of the Seyfert 1 Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) Mrk~1040, utilizing X-ray observations spanning from 2009 to 2024 ($\sim$15 years). The source exhibits pronounced spectral and temporal variability, indicative of transitions between different accretion regimes in the vicinity of the central supermassive black hole. The earlier reported soft excess is re-examined within a uniform, physically motivated multi-epoch framework. We confirm the presence of this soft excess in the 2009 observation, where it is well described by a warm, extended Comptonizing corona with $kT_{\rm e,warm} \sim 0.26$~keV and a radial extent of $R_{\rm warm} \sim 30~r_g$. In subsequent epochs, the soft excess is not statistically significant, possibly due to a combination of enhanced ionized absorption, intrinsic weakening of the warm Comptonizing region, or partial truncation of the inner disc. A strong correlation between the soft and hard X-ray fluxes suggests a common physical origin for both components, likely within a multi-layered Comptonizing structure that evolved into a compact and thermally stable corona after 2013. The observed spectral variability, together with changes in the Fe~K$\alpha$ line strength, reflects the evolving coronal geometry and accretion flow dynamics. Variations in the intrinsic column density ($N_H$) further indicate that Mrk~1040 is embedded within a clumpy, dynamically variable absorber responding to changes in the accretion rate. Using the TCAF model, we estimate the black hole mass as $M_{\rm BH} = (4.50 \pm 1.62) \times 10^7~M_\odot$, consistent with previous estimates.

 - **Abstract**
 We present multi-epoch, multi-band ALMA imaging of the new Class II millimeter methanol masers excited during the accretion outburst of the massive protostar G358.93-0.03 MM1. The highest angular resolution image (24 mas $\approx$ 160 au) reveals a nearly complete, circular ring of strong maser spots in the 217.2992 GHz ($v_t$=1) maser line that closely circumscribes the dust continuum emission from MM1. Weaker maser emission lies inside the eastern and southern halves of the maser ring, generally coincident with the centimeter masers excited during the outburst, but avoiding the densest parts of the hot core gas traced by high excitation lines of CH$_3$CN. Using a variety of fitting techniques on the image cubes of the two strongest maser lines, each observed over 3-4 epochs, we find the diameter of the ring increased by $\gtrsim$60% (from $\approx$1100 to $\approx$1800 au in the 217 GHz line) over 200 days, consistent with an average radial propagation rate of $\approx$0.01c, while the maser intensity declined exponentially. Fitting the angular extent of the millimeter masers versus time yields a power law of index 0.39$\pm$0.06, which also reproduces the observed extent of the 6.7 GHz masers in the first VLBI epoch of R. A. Burns et al. (2020). This exponent is consistent with the prediction of radius vs. time in the Taylor-von Neumann-Sedov self-similar solution for an intense spherical explosion from a point source ($R \propto t^{2/5}$). These results demonstrate the explosive nature of accretion outbursts in massive protostars and their ability to generate subluminal heat waves traceable by centimeter and millimeter masers for several months as the energy traverses the surrounding molecular material.

 - **Abstract**
 Star formation is governed by multiple physical processes, making it inherently complicated. One excellent example is the Canis Major OB1/R1 Association, whose complex history of star formation is related to different episodes. Three supernova (SN) events potentially altered the environment and impacted star formation and stellar evolution. Prior investigations revealed two stellar groups of different ages associated with GU CMa and Z CMa. This work focusses on identifying the low-mass young stellar population near FZ CMa, located between these two groups and spatially related to the H II region Sh 2-295. Our main goal is to verify whether this group is age-mixed and characterise its physical properties. We analysed multi-object spectroscopic data acquired with Gemini/GMOS to search for typical features of T Tauri stars (TTs) and to determine their spectral types. Lithium absorption line ($\lambda$ 6708 $\mathring{A}$) was used as a youth indicator, while H$\alpha$ emission was investigated to probe accretion activity. We also derived ages based on optical photometry from Gaia DR3 and compared the projected spatial distribution to diffuse infrared (IR) emission. We identified 29 TTs, including six new members of the association and three Classical TTs (CTTs). The equivalent width of the Li I absorption line suggests an age of $8.1^{+2.1}_{-3.8}$ Myr, while optical photometric data indicate stellar ages ranging from $\sim$1 to 14 Myr. Younger stars are concentrated around Sh 2-295, whereas the older ones are more widely dispersed. We increased the number of known TTs related to the CMa association. Our results support a scenario of multiple star-formation episodes, including a younger group that may have been triggered by the expansion of Sh 2-295. The influence of SN events appears limited in this context.
#### Dust destruction in bubbles driven by multiple supernovae explosions

 - **Abstract**
 Dust lifetime derived from an isolated supernova (SN) evolution in the interstellar medium is known to be an order of magnitude shorter than the time needed to replenish dust mass by its production in various Galactic sources. We show, using 3-D numerical hydrodynamical simulations, that destruction of dust in the case of multiple SNe in a star cluster is markedly different from that in an isolated SN. We find that the mass of dust destroyed in the bubble does not grow for a considerable time, while SNe continue to explode. This regime is attained at saturation timescale, which is proportional to SNe rate in cluster. We show that the mass of dust destroyed in bubble per SN decreases for higher SN rate. Thus, the destruction efficiency -- defined as the ratio of the the total mass of dust destroyed by clustered SNe to that destroyed by the same number of isolated SNe -- in bubbles evolved in a homogeneous medium drops for massive clusters, e.g. around clusters with $M_\ast > 4\times 10^4 M_\odot$ it is less $0.4$\%. For lower mass clusters, the efficiency is proportional to the average time delay between SNe. We found that each cluster with $M_\ast < 4\times 10^4 M_\odot$ destroys the same mass of dust as a single isolated SN. In a clumpy medium in bubbles formed around clusters with $M_\ast \sim 4\times 10^4 M_\odot$ and up to 4 times around $M_\ast \sim 8\times 10^5 M_\odot$. We argue that the interstellar dust swept up by multiple SNe almost completely survives in the shells of bubbles around such massive clusters. Therefore, the destruction of the interstellar dust is controlled by SNe in low-mass clusters. We point out that the interstellar dust lifetime for a given SN rate is at least a factor $\sim 10$ longer as compared to the estimates derived from an isolated SN. (abridged)
#### The role of PSR J0614-3329 in defining the high-density matter at Neutron star cores

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we investigate how astrophysical observations from NICER and GW data constrain the matter properties at high densities, with a primary focus on the recent PSR J0614-3329 data. We have constructed three distinct classes of an ensemble of agnostic equation of state by speed of sound parametrisation. Bayesian inference is then employed to constrain the EoS construction parameters-namely, the squared speed of sound and chemical potential at each interpolation segment-using the observational data. Both the NICER and GW constraints hint towards a smoother EoS where PT occurs late, significantly reducing the maximum mass of NS. Also, the maximum-mass and maximum-compact sequences are distinctly different, as the former allows for the maximally stiff EoS to maximise the star mass. In contrast, the latter prefers a softer low-density and stiffer high-density EoS to maximise the compactness. The Bayesian analysis demonstrates that the observational bounds are effective in significantly constraining the low-density region of the equation of state. It is also seen that the astrophysical bound prefers the phase transition in the intermediate-density range and also prefers a small density jump for a discontinuous equation of state.

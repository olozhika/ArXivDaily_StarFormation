 - **Abstract**
 The landmark multi-messenger observations of the binary neutron star (BNS) merger GW170817 provided firm evidence that such mergers can produce short gamma-ray bursts (sGRBs). However, the limited number of BNS detections by current gravitational-wave (GW) observatories raises the question of whether BNS mergers alone can account for the full observed sGRB population. We analyze a comprehensive set of 64 BNS population synthesis models with a Monte Carlo-based framework to reproduce the properties of sGRBs detected by Fermi-GBM over the past 16 years. We consider three jet geometry scenarios: a universal structured jet calibrated to GW170817, a universal top-hat jet, and a non-universal top-hat jet with distributions of core opening angles. Our results show that models characterized by low local BNS merger rates ($R_{BNS}(0) \lesssim 50$ Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$) predict too few observable sGRBs to reproduce the Fermi-GBM population, effectively disfavoring them as sole progenitors. Even when relaxing assumptions on jet geometry, low-rate models remain viable only for wide jets ($\theta_c \ge 15^\circ$), in tension with the narrow jet cores ($\theta_c \approx 6^\circ$) inferred from sGRB afterglow observations. In contrast, models with local merger rates of order $R_{BNS}(0) \approx 100$ Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$ successfully reproduce the observed sGRB population, assuming a plausible fraction of BNS mergers launch relativistic jets and realistic jet geometries. This analysis highlights the power of combining GW observations of BNS mergers with electromagnetic observations of sGRBs to place robust constraints on the BNS merger population and to assess their role as progenitors of sGRBs.
#### Revising the Milky Way Cepheid Calibration: Quantifying and Correcting for Previously Undetected Distance Modulus Errors in the Gaia-based Multi-Wavelength Period-Luminosity Relations

 - **Abstract**
 We examine the multi-wavelength period-luminosity-color relations for Cepheid variables in the Large and Small magellanic Clouds and the Milky Way. From first-principles stellar physics, the luminosity of a Cepheid is determined by its radius and surface temperature, yielding a fundamental PLC relation whose observational proxies are pulsation period and intrinsic color. Using Cepheids in the Magellanic Clouds, we show that the PLC relation recovers the known geometries and line-of-sight tilts of their disks, confirming its ability to detect true distance-modulus variations that are achromatic and consistent across all filters. Surprisingly, for Milky Way Cepheids with individually determined reddenings and HST and Gaia parallaxes, the residuals from multi-wavelength PL fits are also found to be achromatic, identical in sign and amplitude across all passbands, in this case indicating that parallax errors are the dominant source of scatter. Applying bandpass-averaged corrections to individual Cepheids recovers the theoretically expected wavelength-dependent narrowing of the instability strip, and results in revised parallaxes with a median improvement in precision of roughly a factor of two. In addition, they show no statistically significant correlation with metallicity over the range -0.2 < Fe/H < 0.05 dex. The final extinction- and reddening-corrected PLC relation yields an rms scatter of 0.04 mag, corresponding to 2 percent precision in distance per star. Use of a physically grounded PLC will provide a more robust foundation for the Cepheid-based extragalactic distance scale and the determination of the Hubble constant.

 - **Abstract**
 In this eighth paper of the SOFIA-FORCAST series on Milky Way GHII regions, we present an analysis of the massive star-forming complex W43 Main. We compared our 11 - 37 micron maps with multi-wavelength observations from the near-infrared to radio, and investigated the physical nature of compact sources and dust substructures. We applied SED fitting to constrain properties of the compact infrared objects, and examined the evolutionary states of the extended subregions. We identified 20 compact infrared objects, 16 (80%) of which we classify as massive young stellar objects (MYSOs) or candidate MYSOs. W43 Main resides at the junction of the Scutum spiral arm and the Galactic Bar, a location where enhanced turbulence is anticipated and has been proposed as a potential influence on star-formation activity. Nevertheless, our analysis shows that its Lyman continuum photon production rate, the mass of its most massive MYSO, and its MYSO density are all consistent with the survey-wide median values. We therefore conclude that, despite W43 Main's unique Galactic environment, its present star formation activity appears broadly consistent with that of an average Galactic GHII region.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding turbulence in interplanetary coronal mass ejections is fundamental to space plasma research and critical for assessing the impact of space weather on geospace. Turbulence governs energy cascade, plasma heating, magnetic reconnection, and solar wind magnetosphere coupling, thereby influencing both ICME evolution and geoeffectiveness. While previous event-based and statistical studies have examined ICME turbulence and its radial evolution in great detail, no significant measurements of ICME magnetic turbulence at a specific vantage point have been made using multiple observatories separated azimuthally. Here, we present the first multipoint analysis of MHD turbulence across ICME plasma regions, using four spacecraft at the Sun-Earth L1 point, separated by 80 RE along the dawn-dusk direction. Previous studies reveal that ICME shocks, sheaths, and magnetic clouds are highly non-uniform, with strong azimuthal variability. Using high-resolution magnetic field observations from ISRO's Aditya-L1, NASA's Wind and ACE, and NOAA's DSCOVR, we analyze turbulence associated with the 10th October 2024 solar storm, which triggered the second-strongest geomagnetic storm of solar cycle 25. Our results reveal significant variability and differing turbulence maturity across small separations, supported by analysis of field-aligned and perpendicular magnetic field cascades, indicating strong anisotropies. Sheath turbulence is substantially modified by shock induced energy injection. Evidence of compressible turbulence and plasma energization at the flux rope interaction region indicates that internal processes, such as magnetic reconnection, strongly influence ICME plasma evolution, highlighting pronounced spatial variability in turbulence and plasma states observed by multiple L1 monitors near Earth and underscoring their potential role in space weather impacts.

 - **Abstract**
 The observations of protostellar systems show a transition in the radial profile of specific angular momentum (and rotational velocity), evolving from $j\sim{\rm constant}$ ($v_{\phi}\sim r^{-1}$) in the infalling-rotating envelope to $j\propto r^{1/2}$ ($v_{\phi}\sim r^{-1/2}$) in the Keplerian disk. We employ global MHD disk simulations of gravitational collapse starting from a supercritical prestellar core, that forms a disk and envelope structure in a self-consistent manner, in order to determine the physics of the Envelope-Disk Transition Zone (ENDTRANZ). Our numerical results show the transition from the infalling-rotating envelope to Keplerian disk happens through a jump in the $j-r$ profile over a finite radial range, which is characterized by the positive local gravitational torques. The outer edge of the ENDTRANZ is identified where the radial infall speed ($v_r$) begins a sharp decline in magnitude and $j$ begins a transition from $j\sim{\rm constant}$ toward $j\sim r^{1/2}$. Moving radially inward, the centrifugal radius ($r_{\rm CR}$) is defined where $v_{\phi}$ first transitions to Keplerian velocity at the disk's edge. Farther inward of $r_{\rm CR}$, model disk develops a super-Keplerian rotation due to self-gravity. The inner edge of the ENDTRANZ is defined at the centrifugal barrier ($r_{\rm CB}$) where $v_r$ drops to negligible values. Inside $r_{\rm CB}$, a net negative gravitational torque drives mass accretion onto the protostar. On observational grounds, we identify a jump in the observed $j-r$ profile in L1527 IRS for the first time using the ALMA eDisk data. Comparison with the numerical radial behavior from our MHD disk simulations suggests the observed $j-r$ jump can be used as a kinematical tracer for the existence of ENDTRANZ. Our results offer insights into the observable imprint of angular momentum redistribution mechanisms during star-disk formation.

 - **Abstract**
 The presence of dust in supernova remnants (SNRs) is confirmed by extensive infrared data from observatories such as Spitzer, Herschel, and JWST, alongside theoretical models of dust formation. This study explores the existence of dust and ices, particularly water ice via 62 {\mu}m in SNRs such as the Crab Nebula and N49, using observational data and preliminary modeling with Cloudy. Observations suggest that water ice may be present in IC 443 and possibly other remnants, though the 63 {\mu}m band could also indicate [OI] emission. Theoretical models indicate that water ice could survive under certain conditions in SNRs, with densities and temperatures analyzed. Further observations and refined simulations are needed to confirm these findings.
#### Dynamical Preconditions for Ice Formation in Supernova Remnant and Cloud Interactions: A 2D MHD Study

 - **Abstract**
 Water ice has been detected in several supernova remnants despite the strong heating and radiation in these environments. This challenges standard expectations for dust survival. Using two dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations, we study how a supernova shock interacts with a dense interstellar cloud. The simulations show that the shock naturally compresses the cloud into dense structures similar to those inferred in well known remnants. Although temperatures remain high in the adiabatic phase, simple considerations indicate that cooling would act quickly once included. These results suggest that shock cloud interactions create the physical conditions needed for water ice to form. Future work including radiative cooling and grain surface chemistry will allow direct modelling of ice growth in these compressed regions.

 - **Abstract**
 The Milky Way hosts astrophysical accelerators capable of producing high-energy cosmic rays. These cosmic rays can interact with the interstellar medium (ISM) across the Galaxy to produce neutrinos and gamma rays (propagation component), while their interactions with ambient material at their acceleration sites, such as supernova remnants, can give rise to the source component of the gamma-ray and neutrino flux. In this paper, we estimate the source component of the Galactic neutrino flux using simulated populations of Galactic gamma-ray sources. We compare our results with observations from neutrino experiments in the energy range of 1-30 TeV. Using simulated populations of Galactic TeV gamma-ray sources, we exploit the correlation between gamma rays and neutrinos and introduce a bracketing approach to constrain the range for the source contribution of the Galactic neutrino flux. For the upper limit, we used a simulation describing the entity of Galactic gamma-ray sources, whereas the lower limit was estimated using the hadronic component of the Galactic supernova remnant population. Our results show that the difference between this maximum and minimum is less than an order of magnitude and the flux range is comparable to the Galactic neutrino flux from the cosmic-ray interaction with the ISM. The results agree with the observed signals from IceCube and ANTARES and suggest that the propagation component, combined with the minimum source contribution predicted by the supernova-remnant model, approaches the observed neutrino flux, leaving little room for significant enhancements of the emission originating from propagating cosmic rays.
#### Dense Molecular Clumps with Large Blue Asymmetries: Evidence for Collapse

 - **Abstract**
 An analysis of the Millimetre Astronomy Legacy Team 90 GHz (MALT90) survey has produced a sample of 27 candidate dense molecular clumps with large collapse motions, as revealed by large ``blue'' asymmetrical line profiles of the optically thick \hcop\, line. %with respect to the optically thin \nthp\, line. New, more sensitive molecular line observations of this sample, conducted with the Mopra 22-m telescope, confirm the blue asymmetries in the \hcop\, line profiles, with large, positive values of the asymmetry parameter $A$ ($\bar{A}_{HCO^+} = 0.69\pm0.01$), and positive, but smaller asymmetries in the \hcn\, and \hnc\, lines: ($\bar{A}_{HCN} = 0.35\pm0.01$ and $\bar{A}_{HNC} = 0.28\pm0.01$), as expected for a less optically thick tracer in collapsing clumps. The small, positive mean asymmetry parameters for \cch\, and \htcop, $\bar{A}_{C_2H} = 0.15\pm0.02$ and $\bar{A}_{H^{13}CO^+} = 0.18\pm0.03$, likely indicate slightly optically thick emission for at least some clumps. The hyperfine ratios for \nthp\, are in their optically thin, LTE, values, but for \hcn\ they are not; the $F=1 \to 1$ hyperfine line shows abnormally weak intensities. A simple two-component model shows that self-absorption of the background $F = 1 \to 1$ hyperfine line by the main $F = 2 \to 1$ hyperfine line of a cold, foreground, redshifted cloud can reproduce the observed \hcn\, hyperfine intensities and match the \hcn\, and \hcop\, line profiles. All of these results are consistent with self-absorption of the optically thick lines on the red side of the profile, as expected for collapsing clumps. A simple two-cloud model suggests that this sample represents dense clumps with extreme collapse velocities, $V_{inf} \sim 2.4$ \kms.

 - **Abstract**
 We combine narrow/medium-band filter photometry from the Southern Photometric Local Universe Survey (S-PLUS) DR4 with ultra broad-band filter photometry from Gaia EDR3 to derive fundamental stellar parameters ($T_{\rm eff}$, $\log g$, [Fe/H], ages) and elemental-abundance ratios ([C/Fe] and [$\alpha$/Fe]) for 5.4 million stars in the Galaxy (4.9 million dwarfs and 0.5 million giants), as well as for over 0.7 million red giant stars in the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds (LMC and SMC). The precisions of the abundance estimates range from 0.05-0.10 dex for metallicity in the relatively metal-rich range ([Fe/H] $> -1.0$) to 0.10-0.30 dex in the metal-poor regime ([Fe/H] $<-1.0$), 0.10-0.20\,dex for [C/Fe], and 0.05 dex for [$\alpha$/Fe]. The stellar parameters for LMC and SMC member stars are somewhat less precise than those from the S-PLUS main survey, primarily because of the effect of high reddening. The use of both metallicity- and carbon-sensitive filters provides unbiased measurements of both [Fe/H] and [C/Fe], of particular importance for very low-metallicity ([Fe/H] $< -2.0$) stars, where carbon enhancement can lead to systematically high estimates of [Fe/H] when only a single metallicity-sensitive filter is employed. Furthermore, multiple narrow-band filters enable metallicity estimates down to [Fe/H] $\sim -4.0$ with an accuracy of around 0.3 dex, exceeding the precision typically achieved by low/medium-resolution spectroscopy. This extensive photometric dataset, combined with the other three datasets in this series, will serve as a valuable legacy resource for Milky Way and Magellanic Clouds studies.
#### Atmospheric constraints on GJ 1214 b from CRIRES+ and prospects for characterisation with ANDES

 - **Abstract**
 In this study, we aim to constrain the atmospheric composition of GJ 1214 b using all available transits observed with the upgraded CRIRES+ spectrograph at the VLT by searching for the signatures of water vapour, methane, and carbon dioxide. We analysed eight CRIRES+ transit datasets covering the K band (1.90-2.45 microns) at a resolving power of R ~ 100,000. We used the SysRem algorithm to correct for telluric and stellar contributions and employed the cross-correlation technique with templates from petitRADTRANS to search for H2O, CH4, and CO2. Injection-recovery tests across a grid of metallicities (Z) and cloud-deck pressures (pc) were performed to quantify detection limits. We also generated predictions for ANDES observations using end-to-end simulated datasets with EXoPLORE. We detect no significant H2O, CH4, or CO2 signatures. Injection-recovery tests show that such non-detections exclude atmospheres with low-altitude clouds and moderate or low metallicities. CH4 yields the tightest empirical limits, with CO2 unexpectedly ruling out intermediate metallicities (~ 100xsolar) with clouds deeper due to its rapidly rising opacity in compressed, high-Z atmospheres. Our constraints are in line with either a high-Z or a high-altitude aerosol layer, in agreement with recent JWST inferences. The combined analysis of eight CRIRES+ datasets provides the most stringent high-resolution constraints on the atmospheric properties of GJ 1214 b to date. Simulations of a single transit observed with ANDES on the ELT predict modest improvements for H2O, a substantially expanded detectable region for CH4, and the strongest gains for CO2, making the latter a particularly effective tracer for characterising high-metallicity atmospheres in sub-Neptunes.
#### The Physical Properties of PS1-12sk and the Implications to Its Progenitor System

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.14427

 - **Abstract**
 PS1-12sk is a type Ibn supernova (SN) found at the host environment showing no obvious ongoing star formation, which challenges the massive star explosion scenario. We use the ejecta-circumstellar medium (CSM) interaction (CSI) and the CSI plus $^{56}$Ni models in the context of double white dwarf (WD) merger to fit the bolometric light curve (LC) of PS1-12sk, since the He emission lines at the photospheric phases indicated the interaction between the SN ejecta and He-rich CSM. We find that the CSI model failed to explain the LC, but the CSI plus $^{56}$Ni model can account for the bolometric LC. The derived masses of the two WDs and $^{56}$Ni are $\sim 0.70 M_\odot$, $\sim 0.40 M_\odot$, and $\sim 0.09\,M_\odot$, respectively. The facts that the ejecta mass ($\sim 0.984 M_\odot$) is well below the Chandrasekhar limit ($\sim 1.4 M_\odot$) and that the $^{56}$Ni mass is comparable to the $^{56}$Ni yields of the explosions of some sub-Chandrasekhar explosion models support the scenario that PS1-12sk might be from a sub-Chandrasekhar explosion induced by the merger of two low-mass WDs. The derived innermost radius ($\sim 13.81 \times 10^{12}$ cm) and the mass of the CSM ($\sim 0.116 M_\odot$) disfavor the possibility that the CSM was formed in the merger phase. We suggest that the flybys before the merger can account for the position and mass of the CSM.
#### Seismic detection of core magnetic fields in red giants using the gravity offset

 - **Abstract**
 Magnetic fields are known to efficiently redistribute angular momentum in stars. They have been recently measured in the cores of red giant stars using asteroseismology. It was shown that core magnetic fields, if unaccounted for, can bias the measurements of the gravity offset $\epsilon_g$, which is otherwise well characterised for red giants. Exploiting this bias as a way to detect magnetic fields in the cores of red giants, we wish to increase the number of magnetic field detections in red giants, but also to establish a method that could be widely applicable to all red giants. We selected 218 Kepler red giants showing abnormal measured values of $\epsilon_g$. We used robust statistical criteria based on the expected lifetime of mixed modes to identify significant modes. We then adjusted an asymptotic expression for mixed modes to the observed frequencies, taking magnetic field and rotation into account, using Bayesian inference. We then assessed the probability of magnetic field detection and measured the magnetic field intensity using stellar models for the favourable cases. We found new magnetic red giant stars with fields ranging from 34 to 260 kG. For these stars, we measured values for $\epsilon_g$ now in agreement with the expected value. Adding these new detections to those of previous studies, we showed that the mass distribution of magnetic giants is similar to that of the complete catalogue of red giants, but different from the mass distribution of red giants with suppressed dipole modes. We also found that the core rotation of magnetic red giants follows a similar distribution as red giants in general. This could either mean that the detected fields do not have a predominant impact on the redistribution of angular momentum, or that other red giants also harbour an internal field that is currently non-detectable or has not yet been detected.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Solid methane (CH$_4$) is an important molecule in interstellar and planetary environments, serving as a precursor to complex organic compounds and a potential biosignature in exoplanetary studies. Despite its significance, laboratory data on low-temperature phase of methane below 10 K remain limited. Aims. We aim to obtain spectra of methane in binary mixtures at 10 K and compare it to the spectra obtained at 6.7 K. These temperatures correspond to phases II and II* of pure methane and are representative of dark molecular clouds and protostars at early stages. We also aim to test the obtained data applicability to JWST data interpretation. Methods. Laboratory reference spectra were obtained on the ISEAge setup via FTIR spectroscopy in transmission mode. A weighted $\chi^2$ minimization is used for the fitting. Results. We present infrared spectra with corresponding band strengths of pure methane and binary mixtures with methane: CH$_4$:H$_2$O,CH$_4$:CO$_2$, CH$_4$:CH$_3$OH, CH$_4$:NH$_3$ at 6.7 K and 10 K showing a 20\% increase in mixtures compared to commonly used 10 K band strength value of pure methane. We also test the usability of the spectra on open JWST data by probing the spatial distribution of methane in B335. We also present additional experiments concerning the phase transition of methane between phase II* and phase II. Conclusions. Our results reveal distinct spectral features for methane in non-H$_2$O environments, enabling more accurate interpretation of JWST observations. The dataset of spectra, publicly available on Zenodo, can be used for fitting JWST data.

 - **Abstract**
 Miras and other long-period variable (LPV) stars on the AGB follow period-luminosity (PL) relations. These relations have been difficult to study for Galactic LPVs because their distances were poorly known in the past. We aim to establish the PL relations of solar-neighbourhood Miras for several near-IR photometric bands. To this end, we used multi-epoch photometry from the DIRBE and unTimely/WISE catalogues, Gaia parallax distances, and contemporary pulsation periods obtained from optical observations of a well-selected sample of solar-neighbourhood Miras. We show that clearly defined PL relations in the nine investigated near-IR bands emerge from our data, and we report the slopes and zero-point magnitudes. We find that Galactic Miras are fainter in the near-IR than their Large Magellanic Cloud siblings. We derive average period-temperature, period-bolometric-luminosity, and period-radius relations from fits to synthetic SEDs constructed from the PL relations. By applying AGB evolutionary models, the scatter of stars around the PL sequences can also be used to test whether the parallax uncertainties quoted in the Gaia catalogue are realistic. Furthermore, we performed such tests based on a comparison with parallaxes obtained with the VLBI and with a sample of LPVs in the globular cluster 47 Tuc. We conclude that, for Galactic Miras with a fractional parallax uncertainty of <0.1 in the Gaia catalogue, the parallax uncertainty is underestimated by factors between 1.0 and 1.7, and most likely by $\sim1.3$. For more uncertain parallaxes, we find evidence that the distances (parallaxes) are generally overestimated (underestimated). Nevertheless, we find strong evidence that the large error-inflation factors reported for AGB stars in the literature are unrealistic. Our results lend confidence to the parallax measurements of these highly extended, variable stars.

 - **Abstract**
 Astrochemical observations have revealed a surprisingly high level of chemical complexity, including long carbon chains, in the earliest stages of Sun-like star formation. The origin of these species and whether they undergo further growth, possibly contributing to the molecular complexity of planetary systems, remain open questions. We present recent observations performed using the 100-m Green Bank Telescope of the prestellar core L1544 and the protostellar system IRAS 16293-2422. In L1544, we detected several complex carbon-bearing species, including $\mathrm{C_2S}$, $\mathrm{C_3S}$, $\mathrm{C_3N}$, $\mathrm{c\text{-}C_3H}$, $\mathrm{C_4H}$, and $\mathrm{C_6H}$, complementing previously reported emission of cyanopolyynes. In IRAS 16293-2422, we detected $\mathrm{c\text{-}C_3H}$ and, for the first time, $\mathrm{HC_7N}$. Thanks to the high spectral resolution, we refine the rest frequencies of several $\mathrm{c\text{-}C_3H}$ and $\mathrm{C_6H}$ transitions. We perform radiative transfer analysis, highlighting a chemical difference between the two sources: IRAS 16293-2422 shows column densities 10-100 times lower than L1544. We perform astrochemical modeling, employing an up-to-date chemical network with revised reaction rates. The models reproduce the general trends, with cyanopolyyne and polyynyl radical abundances decreasing as molecular size increases, but they underestimate the abundances of cyanopolyynes longer than $\mathrm{HC_5N}$ by up to two orders of magnitude. Current models, which include the dominant neutral-neutral formation routes, cannot account for this discrepancy, suggesting that the chemical network is incomplete. We propose that additional ion-molecule reactions are crucial for the formation of these species. Developing a more comprehensive chemical network for long carbon chains is essential for accurately interpreting present and future observations.

 - **Abstract**
 The results of interferometric observations of the star-forming region S255IR in the frequency range 210--250 GHz are presented. The observations were carried out with the antenna array SMA (Hawaii, USA). Fifty-three molecules were detected, including complex organic molecules (COMs) such as CH$_3$CHO, CH$_3$CN, CH$_3$CH$_2$CN, and many others. Typical rotational temperatures in the hot core SMA1 fall in the range 100--200 K. Optical depths in the lines of methanol and some other molecules in the cores SMA1 and SMA2 were estimated. In SMA1, the optical depth of one of the strongest methanol lines, $5_{-1}-4_{-1}E$, proved to be $23.8 \pm 1.5$. Based on this value, one can assume that the lines of other oxygen-containing COMs, such as CH$_3$OCHO, CH$_3$OCH$_3$, CH$_3$CH$_2$OH, which are typically much less abundant in hot cores than methanol, are optically thin in SMA1. Most of the detected molecules can be roughly divided into two groups. The molecules of the first group emit exclusively toward the hot core SMA1, while some or all lines of the molecules of the second group, in addition to SMA1, can be seen toward a ring-like structure to the west of SMA1. This structure is most likely associated with the walls of a cavity formed by high-velocity outflows driven by young stellar objects (YSOs) in molecular cores SMA1, SMA2, and possibly SMA3. The gas temperature and density in the cavity walls were estimated using methanol lines. The temperature was found to be about 50--60 K, and the density about $10^7-10^8$ cm$^{-3}$. The column density of methanol near the brightness peaks in the lines of this molecule is about $5\times 10^{15}$~cm$^{-2}$. The column densities of other COMs in the ring-like structure will be determined in future studies with increased sensitivity achieved by spectral line stacking.

 - **Abstract**
 Long-period radio transients (LPTs) are a new class of radio sources characterized by long spin periods ($P_{\text{spin}}>10^3$ s) and highly variable radio emission. While known magnetars are relatively young ($\tau<10^5$ yrs) with spin periods clustered between $1-10$ sec, it has been proposed that LPTs may be linked to a missing population of older magnetars. In this paper, we present an extensive parametric analysis of isolated magnetar spin evolution using various propeller spin-down models. In general, at higher initial magnetar B-fields ($B_0>\sim10^{15}$ G) and larger ambient densities ($n_0>\sim10^2$ cm$^{-3}$), magnetars will transition to the propeller phase earlier, and they start accreting gas from the ISM or molecular clouds after $\tau\sim10^8$ yrs. We found that a transition from the pulsar to the propeller phase is required to reach the observed LPT period range of $P>10^3$ s. More specifically, our population synthesis study based on Monte-Carlo simulations shows that two propeller models can account for most of the observed LPT periods ($P\sim1-400$ [min]) and their period derivative constraints ($\dot{P}<10^{-9}$ s s$^{-1}$). Our spin-down models predict that (1) nearby radio-quiet neutron stars with the estimated dipole $B$-field range of $B\sim(1-5)\times10^{13}$ G will transition to the propeller phase eventually after $\tau>\sim10^7$ yrs; (2) thermal X-ray emission from accretion-phase magnetars becomes too faint for detection after traveling ($d>\sim10$ kpc) from their birth places; (3) sporadic radio outbursts observed from LPTs may not be explained by regular radio pulsar and magnetar emission mechanisms that operate during the propeller phase.

#### Core Collapse Beyond the Fluid Approximation: The Late Evolution of Self-Interacting Dark Matter Halos

 - **Abstract**
 We show that the gravothermal collapse of self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) halos can deviate from local thermodynamic equilibrium. As a consequence, the self-similar evolution predicted by the commonly adopted conducting fluid model can be altered or broken. Our results are obtained using a novel, efficient kinetic solver called KiSS-SIDM for tracing the gravothermal evolution based on the Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) framework. In the long mean free path stage, the code is a viable alternative to the fluid model, yet requires no calibration parameters. Further, this method enables a fully kinetic treatment well into the late, short mean free path, stage of the collapse. We apply the method to a canonical case with isotropic, velocity independent scattering. We find that although a fluid treatment is appropriate deep in the short mean free path core, departures from local thermodynamic equilibrium develop in the intermediate mean free path region bounding the core, which modify the late-time evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 The Nuclear Stellar Disc (NSD) is a rotating, disc-like structure in the Galactic Center, believed to have a distinct star formation. However, its formation history and evolutionary links to other structures in the Galactic Center remain uncertain. This study aims to present the first comprehensive chemical census of the NSD by deriving abundance trends for 18 elements in 9 M giants in the metallicity range of -1.0 <[Fe/H]< 0.5. By comparing these trends with those of other Galactic populations we seek to understand the chemical relationships between these structures. We obtained high-resolution H- and K-band spectra of NSD stars using the IGRINS spectrometer mounted on the Gemini South telescope. The giants were analyzed consistently with stars from a comparison populations to minimize systematic uncertainties. The abundance trends of NSD stars exhibit similarities with those of the inner-bulge and Nuclear Star Cluster (NSC) populations across a broad range of elements with different chemical evolution histories. The trends for 17 elements align closely with the local thick-disc behaviour at subsolar metallicities. At super-solar metallicities, most elements follow the NSC and inner-bulge trends. Sodium is the only element exhibiting a distinct trend, with enhanced abundances in the NSD and NSC compared to both thin-disc and inner-bulge stars. The chemical similarity suggests that the NSD likely shares an evolutionary history with the NSC and possibly the inner-disc sequence. Further studies are required to determine potential evolutionary links to Liller 1 and metal-rich globular clusters. We find no evidence of typical globular cluster abundance signatures in our NSD stars with subsolar metallicities. Our study demonstrates the feasibility of obtaining high-quality abundance data even in highly dust-obscured regions of the Milky Way, paving the way for future surveys.
#### NIRCam yells at cloud: JWST MIRI imaging can directly detect exoplanets of the same temperature, mass, age, and orbital separation as Saturn and Jupiter

 - **Abstract**
 NIRCam and MIRI coronagraphy have successfully demonstrated the ability to directly image young sub-Jupiter mass and mature gas-giant exoplanets. However, these modes struggle to reach the sensitivities needed to find the population of cold giant planets that are similar to our own Solar System's giant planets ($T_{\rm eff} = 60 - 125$ K; $a=5 - 30$ AU). For the first time, we explore the high-contrast imaging capabilities of MIRI imaging rather than coronagraphy. Using data from the JWST GO 6122: Cool Kids on the Block program which targets nearby ($<6$ pc) M-dwarfs with NIRCam coronagraphy and MIRI imaging, we demonstrate that 21$\mu$m MIRI imaging can detect planets with the same temperature, mass, age, and orbital separations as Saturn and Jupiter. For systems within 3pc, 21$\mu$m MIRI imaging reaches the sensitivity needed to detect planets colder than Saturn ($<95$ K). NIRCam coronagraphy can achieve similar results only in the unlikely case that a cold giant planet is cloud-free. Motivated by these compelling findings, we extend our analysis to evaluate the measured performance of MIRI F2100W imaging versus NIRCam F444W coronagraphy to 70 pc and conclude that MIRI imaging offers the advantage for systems within 20pc. Microlensing surveys predict an occurrence rate as high as 1 - 2 low-mass giant exoplanets per star, suggesting that JWST MIRI imaging surveys of nearby systems may be poised to uncover a substantial population. This breakthrough enables a path towards the first direct characterization of cold giant exoplanets that are analogous to the solar system giant planets.

 - **Abstract**
 High-velocity clouds (HVCs) are interstellar gas clouds whose velocities are incompatible with Galactic rotation. Since the first discovery of HVCs in 1963, their origins have been debated for decades but are still not settled down, because of the lack of vital parameters of HVCs, e.g., the distance. In this work, we determined the distance to the high-velocity cloud, namely the Anti-Center Shell (ACS). We trace the ACS with extinction derived from K-giant stars with known distances and with the diffuse interstellar band (DIB) feature at 5780 $\text{Å}$ fitted on spectra of O- and B-type stars with distance. As a result, we provide a lower limit distance of ACS as $\sim$8 kpc, which extends the lower limit outward by approximately 4 kpc compared to previous work. A byproduct of the DIB method is that we detected a bar-shaped structure with a unusually high positive line-of-sight velocity. Its shape extends along the (l,b)=(155,-5)$^{\circ}$ sight-line and shows a slightly increasing trend in equivalent width and velocity as the distance increases.
#### Effect of thermal conductivity on the simultaneous formation of a stable region at the top of Earth's core and magnetic field generation over four billion years

 - **Abstract**
 The possibility of the emergence of a stratified region in the uppermost part of the Earth's outer core with long-term magnetic field generation is assessed, taking into account uncertainties in the thermal conductivity of the Earth's core and the present-day heat flow across the core-mantle boundary (CMB). The radial structures of the Earth's outer core are calculated for various values of thermal conductivity and CMB heat flow using a one-dimensional thermo-chemical model. The results show that there exist solutions that allow both emergence of stable stratification and long-term magnetic field generation although their thickness of stratified region is thinner than 100 km. In order to satisfy both emergence of stratified region and long-term magnetic field generation, possible value of the present-day CMB heat flow (13-15 TW) suggests a thermal conductivity of 77-121 W/m/K at CMB, which is in good agreement with the values estimated from the electrical conductivity measurements under the Earth' s core condition. The thickness of the stratified region in this case is about 50 km, which is also consistent with the thickness of the stratified region estimated from the geomagnetic secular variation. However, the proposed values of thermal conductivity obtained by this analysis could be smaller when the present-day CMB heat flow becomes smaller than the constraint used in this study.

 - **Abstract**
 Formaldehyde (H$_2$CO) and methanol (CH$_3$OH) have served as traditional tracers of the star formation process for decades. Studies of the environments which produce these species, though, have pointed to significant differences in the physical environments within which each molecule resides. In this paper we investigate the physical and chemical conditions which give rise to formaldehyde and methanol emission in the nearby starburst galaxy NGC 253. We employ high spatial (1.$''$6 or $\sim28$ pc) and spectral ($\sim10$ km/s) imaging of the NGC 253 central molecular zone (CMZ) from the ALCHEMI Large Program to constrain radiative transfer models of the dense gas volume density, and temperature, molecular species column density, and source filling factor within eight giant molecular clouds (GMCs). We also measure the relative abundances of the two nuclear spin isomers of CH$_3$OH to investigate its formation history. The physical and chemical conditions derived clearly indicate that H$_2$CO and CH$_3$OH originate from distinct physical environments. H$_2$CO traces low volume density and high kinetic temperatures, while CH$_3$OH traces high volume density and low kinetic temperatures. The H$_2$CO abundances are constant, though poorly constrained, within the eight NGC 253 GMCs analyzed, while the CH$_3$OH abundance shows a radial gradient from low to high values within the NGC 253 CMZ. Our findings highlight the complex chemical and physical differentiation of CH$_3$OH and H$_2$CO in the starburst environment of NGC 253. Methanol formation appears to be influenced by warm, dynamic processes rather than cold cloud chemistry, while formaldehyde primarily forms via gas-phase reactions. These results challenge the assumption of a direct chemical link between CH$_3$OH and H$_2$CO and underscores the impact of starburst-driven shocks, turbulence, and cosmic rays on molecular gas chemistry.
#### Influence of Bar Formation on Star Formation Segregation and Stellar Migration: Implications for Variations in the Age Distribution of Milky Way Disk Stars

 - **Abstract**
 We present a chemo-dynamical $N$-body/hydrodynamic simulation of an isolated Milky Way-like galaxy to investigate how bar formation influences star formation rates, stellar migration, and the resulting age and metallicity distributions of disk stars. Focusing on the transient epoch of bar formation, a phase that triggers gas inflows, enhances local star formation, and drives significant orbital migration, we find that the star formation rate in the inner disk exhibits a pronounced peak during this period. This behavior arises from the combined effect of vigorous star formation driven by strong spiral arms prior to bar formation and the subsequent suppression of star formation once the bar is established. In contrast, star formation in the outer disk persists after bar formation at modest levels, and enhanced outward migration of stars originally formed in the inner regions gives rise to a pronounced peak in the outer disk's stellar age distribution corresponding to the bar formation epoch. Moreover, stars formed during this epoch tend to exhibit higher gas-phase metallicities, reflecting their origin in more metal-rich inner regions. Although our model does not capture every detail of the Milky Way's complex evolution, our results highlight the dominant role of bar driven migration in segregating star formation activity and in shaping the long-term chemical and age structure of the Galactic disk. Recent observational studies suggest that the Milky Way's bar is approximately 8 Gyr old; therefore, our findings imply that the age distribution of stars in the solar circle and outer disk should show a corresponding peak around that age.
#### Abiotic Ozone in the Observable Atmospheres of Venus and Venus-like Exoplanets

 - **Abstract**
 Ozone is a potential biosignature and disambuguator between Earth-like and Venus-like exoplanets due to its association on Earth with photosynthetically produced oxygen (O$_2$). However, the existence of ozone in Venus's observable atmosphere, a planet with no known life, raises the possibility of ozone biosignature false-positives on Venus-like exoplanets. We use a photochemical model of Venus's atmosphere to investigate the origin of its mesospheric ozone layer, and to predict how similar ozone layers would manifest for Venus-like exoplanets. For Venus, our model shows that the previously proposed fluxes of O atoms produced on the dayside and transported to the nightside cannot generate enough ozone to match the observed nightside ozone concentrations without also producing O$_2$ in excess of the observed upper limit. Nor can sufficient ozone be produced by varying the lower-atmosphere chemistry, atmospheric thermal structure, or received stellar flux in our model of Venus's atmosphere. These results imply that a presently unknown chemical pathway is responsible for the ozone production in Venus's nightside mesosphere. Ozone production rates from this pathway of 10$^5$--10$^7$ cm$^{-3}$s$^{-1}$ above the cloud layer on the nightside can re-produce the observed O$_3$ concentrations. Generalised to Venus-like exoplanets, known chemistry similarly fails to produce ozone in the abundance seen in the Venusian mesosphere. However, until the origin of Venus's ozone is understood, we cannot rule out that ozone production at concentrations observable with JWST will be common on abiotic Venus-like worlds, a possibility that limits the usefulness of ozone as a habsignature and as a biosignature.
#### High angular resolution near-ultraviolet polarization imaging of the Herbig Ae/Be star LK-Hα-233

 - **Abstract**
 Herbig Ae/Be stars are young, pre-main-sequence stars that provide critical insights into the processes of stellar formation, early stellar evolution and protoplanetary this http URL of the key features of such stars are their circumstellar dusty disk and bipolar ionized outflows, which are key components for understanding planet formation processes and energy/matter deposition in the interstellar medium, respectively. In this context, imaging polarimetry is probably the sharpest tool to characterize the various structures and dynamics around the central star, due to the sensitivity of polarization to the morphology of the emitting, scattering and absorbing media. We take advantage of never published, near-ultraviolet polarimetric data of LK-H{\alpha}-233 taken by the Faint Object Camera aboard the Hubble Space Telescope in 1991, 1994 and 1995, which remained dormant in the archives despite their quality. Using the most recent and robust reduction pipeline for this instrument, we obtained high spatial resolution (0.0287 x 0.0287 arcsecond2) maps of this object at 4118 Å, together with polarimetric measurements. A dark lane, bisecting the approaching and receding polar outflows, suggests the presence of a circumstellar disk or dust torus, obscuring the pre-main sequence star and collimating the ejecta. Polarization reveals that the outflows have an X-shape structure with a significant centro-symmetric pattern in polarization angle, indicating that the outflows are both hollow and scattering the emission from the buried star. We constrain the half-opening angle of both the outflows and circumstellar disk, determine the inclination of the system and estimate the obscured star's intrinsic flux. This study highlights the importance of high-resolution polarimetric observations in understanding the complex environment around Herbig Ae/Be stars and advocates for future similar instruments.

 - **Abstract**
 IceCube is a Cherenkov detector instrumenting over a cubic kilometer of glacial ice deep under the surface of the South Pole. The DeepCore sub-detector lowers the detection energy threshold to a few GeV, enabling the precise measurements of neutrino oscillation parameters with atmospheric neutrinos. The reconstruction of neutrino interactions inside the detector is essential in studying neutrino oscillations. It is particularly challenging to reconstruct sub-100 GeV events with the IceCube detectors due to the relatively sparse detection units and detection medium. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are broadly used in physics experiments for both classification and regression purposes. This paper discusses the CNNs developed and employed for the latest IceCube-DeepCore oscillation measurements. These CNNs estimate various properties of the detected neutrinos, such as their energy, direction of arrival, interaction vertex position, flavor-related signature, and are also used for background classification.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the effect of planetary corotation on energy dissipation within the magnetosphere-ionosphere system of exoplanets. Using MHD simulations, we find that tidally locked exoplanets have a higher cross-polar cap potential (CPCP) compared to fast-rotating planets with the same magnetic field strength, confirming previous studies. Our simulations show that for a given interplanetary magnetic field, an increase in corotation period leads to a higher CPCP. Notably, this difference in CPCP between tidally locked and rotating planets persists across a range of solar wind conditions, including extreme environments such as those experienced by hot Jupiters. Furthermore, we observe that variations in corotation have little impact on CPCP for Earth-sized planets. These results underscore the significance of both corotation dynamics and planetary size in understanding how exoplanets interact with their stellar environments.

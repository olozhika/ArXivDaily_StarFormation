 - **Abstract**
 Calibrating out per-antenna signal chain effects is an essential step in analyzing radio interferometric data. For drift-scanning arrays, robustly calibrating the data is especially challenging due to the lack of the ability to track a calibration source. Consequently, calibration strategies for drift-scanning arrays are limited by our knowledge of the radio sky at large, as well as the direction-dependent instrument response. In the context of 21 cm cosmology, where small calibration errors can conspire to overwhelm the cosmological signal, it is therefore crucially important to develop calibration strategies that are capable of accurately calibrating the data in the presence of sky or instrument modeling errors. In this paper we present CorrCal, a covariance-based calibration strategy for redundant radio interferometric arrays. CorrCal is a hybrid calibration strategy that leverages the strengths of traditional sky-based calibration and redundant calibration in a computationally efficient framework that is fairly insensitive to modeling errors. We find that the calibration errors from CorrCal are unbiased and far below typical thermal noise thresholds across a wide range of modeling error scenarios. We show that CorrCal is computationally efficient: our implementation is capable of evaluating the likelihood and its gradient in less than a second for 1,000-element class arrays using just a single laptop core. Given CorrCal's computational efficiency and robustness to modeling errors, we anticipate that it will serve as a useful tool in the analysis of radio interferometric data from current and next-generation experiments targeting the cosmological 21 cm signal.

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar high-energy radiation is a key driver of atmospheric erosion and evolution in exoplanets, directly affecting their long-term habitability. We present a comprehensive study on stellar high-energy radiation and its impact on exoplanetary atmospheres, leveraging data from the \textit{SRG/eROSITA} all-sky survey. Our sample consists of 3750 main-sequence stars identified by cross-matching with \textit{Gaia} DR3. Utilizing X-ray spectral fits from the \textit{eROSITA} catalog, we computed X-ray ($L_X$) and combined extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) luminosities ($L_{\mathrm{EUV}}$), which we used to derive XUV fluxes at the habitable zone ($F_{\mathrm{XUV,HZ}}$). We find that the majority of stars in our sample are significantly more XUV-active than the Sun, with habitable zone fluxes ranging from $10^0$ to $10^5$ erg~cm$^{-2}$~s$^{-1}$. The ratio of $L_{\mathrm{XUV}}/L_{\mathrm{bol}}$ is found to be higher for cooler, magnetically active stars, highlighting their potentially hazardous nature for planetary atmospheres. Applying the energy-limited escape model, we computed atmospheric mass-loss rates for hypothetical earth-like planets located at the habitable zone of each star. We also present local maps for distances up to $500$~pc of the average XUV flux, revealing ``hazard zones'' where stellar radiation could significantly influence planetary atmospheric evolution. This work demonstrates the power of X-ray surveys in constraining the high-energy environments of exoplanets and underscores the critical role of stellar activity in planetary habitability.
#### How Neutron Star Observations Point Towards Exotic Matter: Existing Explanations and a Prospective Proposal

 - **Abstract**
 Multi-messenger astronomical observations of neutron stars, together with more precise calculations and constraints coming from dense matter microphysics, are generating tension with regard to equations of state models used to describe neutron star cores. Assuming an abrupt first-order phase transition with a slow conversion speed between phases, we propose different slow stable hybrid star configurations aiming to reconcile all current constraints simultaneously; within this framework, we also introduce a novel non-CSS parametrization to the quark matter equation of state and discuss its strengths and limitations. We analyze our model results in conjunction with a review of other relevant theoretical possibilities existing in the literature. We found that modern neutron star observations seem to favor the existence of some type of exotic matter in the neutron star cores; in particular, our slow stable hybrid star scenario remains a proposal capable of satisfying these constraints. However, due both to the existing skepticism regarding some of the adopted hypotheses in most extreme neutron star measurements and to the precise adjustment needed for the equation-of-state parameters, significant tension and open questions remain.
#### Compact HII Regions as Clocks of Massive-Star Formation: Evidence for Long Formation Timescales

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.06196

 - **Abstract**
 We revisit the luminosity function (LF) of compact HII regions in the context of the inertial--inflow model, in which massive stars assemble over extended, mass-dependent timescales. The comparison of the compact-HII-region LF with that of OB stars is traditionally used to estimate the compact-HII-phase lifetime and is often cited as evidence for the classical ``lifetime problem" of HII regions. We show that once stellar growth during the ionizing phase is included, the LF comparison instead constrains massive-star formation timescales, so the lifetime problem turns into evidence for prolonged growth. We illustrate the principle with a simple analytic model and then forward-model the two LFs with Monte Carlo realizations. We also derive revised Galactic LFs for compact HII regions and OB stars from the Red MSX Source survey and the Alma Luminous Star catalogue. The joint LF constraints imply a growth law where the formation time is about 2 Myr for a $60\,M_\odot$ star, with a square-root dependence on mass. The revised OB-star LF exhibits a statistically significant knee at $\log_{10}(L_{\rm k}/L_\odot)=5.0$, while the HII-region LF knee occurs at lower luminosity, as expected in the interpretation that HII regions are powered by stars that are still growing in mass. We conclude that massive stars in the Milky Way form over Myr timescales that increase with their final mass.
#### Disk-Regulated Mass Transfer Between Rotating Non-Degenerate Stars: Insights from Be and sdOB Binaries

 - **Abstract**
 Mass transfer between non-degenerate stars is a fundamental but still poorly understood process in binary evolution. The commonly used rotationally limited accretion prescription in detailed binary evolution simulations that account for stellar rotation generally yields low accretion efficiencies that are difficult to reconcile with several observational constraints. We present a physically-motivated mass-accretion prescription in which accretion or decretion disks regulate the angular momentum transported to the accretor, thereby allowing for continued accretion at near-critical rotation. The accretion efficiency can be calculated from the conservation of the mass and the angular momentum of the disk. Analytical estimates show that the accretion efficiency depends on stellar rotation and mass ratio for direct impact accretion, and additionally on stellar radius and orbital separation in the disk accretion regime. The overall mass-weighted accretion efficiencies are close to the values expected near the threshold rotation rate, where the accreted specific angular momentum declines sharply. Applying this model to binary evolution simulations, we find that rotationally limited accretion systematically underestimates Be-star masses in Be+subdwarf O/B-type star (sdOB) systems, whereas the disk-star coupling model can produce more massive Be stars that are consistent with observations. The final binary component masses depend not only on accretion efficiency but also core-envelope mass ratio, which itself depends sensitively on the assumed overshooting. We find that our new disk-star coupling model with reduced overshooting yields component masses for Be+sdOB systems that are in closer agreement with observations.

 - **Abstract**
 Extragalactic fast X-ray transients (eFXTs) represent a rapidly growing class of high-energy phenomena, whose physical origins remain poorly understood. With its wide-field, sensitive all-sky monitoring, the Einstein Probe (EP) has greatly increased the discovery rate of eFXTs. The search and identification of the optical counterparts of eFXT are vital for understanding their classification and constraining their physical origin. Yet, a considerable fraction of eFXTs still lack secure classifications due to the absence of timely follow-up observations. We carry out a systematic search of publicly available optical survey data and transient databases (including the Zwicky Transient Facility, ZTF, and the Transient Name Server, TNS) for optical counterparts to eFXT candidates detected by EP. In this paper, we describe our ongoing program and report the first results. Specifically, we identified the eFXT EP240506a to be associated with a UV/optical counterpart, AT 2024ofs. Spectroscopy of its host galaxy with VLT yields a redshift of $z = 0.120 \pm 0.002$. By combining archival survey data with early-time multiwavelength observations, we find that the luminosity and light-curve evolution of AT~2024ofs are consistent with a core-collapse supernova origin. From detectability simulations, we estimate a local event rate density $\rho_{0}=8.8^{+21.2}_{-3.9}\ \mathrm{yr^{-1}\, Gpc^{-3}}$ for EP240506a-like events, and completeness-corrected rate of about $36$--$78\ \mathrm{yr^{-1}\ Gpc^{-3}}$ for EP-detected X-ray transients associated with supernovae. Our results demonstrate the potential of EP to uncover prompt high-energy emission from core-collapse supernovae and underscore the critical importance of timely follow-up of future eFXT events.

 - **Abstract**
 There is increasing evidence that, in the very late phase of stellar evolution before core collapse, massive stars have winds with large mass loss rates that give rise to a dense circumstellar medium (CSM) surrounding the progenitor star. After core collapse, a shock wave forms when the supernova ejecta interacts with this CSM. In such an interaction, the nuclei in the CSM can undergo diffusive shock acceleration and reach very high energies. We consider such a model, which includes magnetic field amplification from the non-resonant streaming instability, enhancement to the abundance of heavy-ions, and composition-dependent acceleration. Applying this to several supernova subclasses, we find that IIn supernovae can supply a dominant fraction of the observed super-knee cosmic-ray (CR) flux from $\sim{\rm few}\times10^{15}\,{\rm eV}$ to $\sim{\rm few}\times10^{17}\,{\rm eV}$ and is consistent with recent LHAASO measurements above the CR knee. This systematic model also explains the increasingly heavy nuclear composition in this energy range.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a highly scalable, MPI-parallelized framework for reconstructing the initial cosmic density field, designed to meet the computational demands of next-generation cosmological simulations, particularly the upcoming ELUCID-DESI simulation based on DESI BGS data. Building upon the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo approach and the FastPM solver, our code employs domain decomposition to efficiently distribute memory between nodes. Although communication overhead increases the per-step runtime of the MPI version by roughly a factor of eight relative to the shared-memory implementation, our scaling tests-spanning different particle numbers, core counts, and node layouts-show nearly linear scaling with respect to both the number of particles and the number of CPU cores. Furthermore, to significantly reduce computational costs during the initial burn-in phase, we introduce a novel ``guess'' module that rapidly generates a high-quality initial density field. The results of the simulation test confirm substantial efficiency gains: for $256^3$ particles, 53 steps ($\sim$54 CPU hours) are saved; for $1024^3$, 106 steps ($\sim$7500 CPU hours). The relative gain grows with the number of particles, rendering large-volume reconstructions computationally practical for upcoming surveys, including our planned ELUCID-DESI reconstruction simulation with $8192^3$ particles, with a rough estimation of 720 steps ($\sim$37,000,000 CPU hours).
#### The Walkaway Star HP Tau/G2: Evidence for a Stellar Merger

 - **Abstract**
 HP~Tau/G2 is a luminous, short-period, fast-rotating G-type weak-line T Tauri star with a large radius, an oblate shape with gravity-darkening, little circumstellar material, and centered in a slowly expanding cloud cavity. It is an X-ray source and a variable nonthermal radio source. It forms, together with the late-type T Tauri star KPNO 15, a pair of oppositely directed walkaway stars launched when a multiple system broke apart ~5600 yr ago. Momentum conservation indicates a mass of G2 of only ~0.7 Msun, much lower than the ~1.9 Msun determined from evolutionary models. G2 is virtually a twin of FK Com, the prototype of a class of evolved stars resulting from coalescence of W UMa binaries. We suggest that G2 became a very close and highly eccentric binary during viscous evolution in the protostellar stage and with KPNO 15 formed a triple system, which again was part of a larger unstable group including the binary G3 and the single G1. Dynamical evolution led to multiple bound ejections of KPNO 15 before it finally escaped after ~2 Myr. As a result the G2 binary recoiled and contracted 5600 yr ago, became Darwin unstable and merged in a major outburst ~2000 yr ago. The nearby compact triple system G1+G3 was also disturbed, and broke up 4900 yr ago, forming another walkaway pair. The G5 star HD 283572 has similar unusual properties, indicating that G2 is not a pathological case. G2 is now fading towards a new stable configuration. YSO mergers may be rather common and could explain some FUor eruptions.

 - **Abstract**
 The unpredictability of solar filament eruptions presents major challenges for forecasting space weather, as such eruptions frequently drive coronal mass ejections (CMEs) that impact the heliosphere. While nearby flux emergence is often linked to their destabilisation, the specific characteristics of both the emerging flux and the filament that determine whether an eruption occurs remain unclear. We report observations of a quiescent filament that did not erupt following the nearby emergence of active region NOAA 13270 and a subsequent C-class flare in April 2023. Our analysis combines multi-viewpoint extreme ultraviolet (EUV) imaging and X-ray imaging with EUV spectroscopy, radio imaging and measurements of, and extrapolations from, the photospheric magnetic field. We identify the formation of a coronal null point and fan-spine topology at the interface between the active region and filament which exhibited persistent slow reconnection, indicated by chromospheric brightenings, persistent radio emission, and plasma upflows. Our results indicate that ongoing reconnection and jets can relieve magnetic stress and enable filament stability, even when under strong perturbation. We suggest that the orientation of emerging flux relative to the ambient field is a critical parameter in filament evolution, and provide observational constraints for models of filament stability and eruption.
#### The effect of JWST/NIRSpec data reduction on the retrieval of WASP-39b atmospheric properties

 - **Abstract**
 The JWST provides exoplanet transit observations with unprecedented spectral coverage, enabling detailed atmospheric characterisation. However, systematics introduced during data reduction can lead to small but significant uncertainties that propagate into atmospheric retrievals, making it essential to assess their impact on inferred properties. We aim to quantify the impact of different JWST/NIRSpec PRISM data-reduction processes as well as the relevance of saturation on the retrieved atmospheric properties of WASP-39b. We also assess whether or not these biases are comparable to those introduced by assumptions made in atmospheric modelling, particularly in the treatment of aerosol extinction. We perform nested-sampling Bayesian retrievals using MultiNest and forward models generated with the Planetary Spectrum Generator. Six independently reduced spectra are analysed, considering both the full wavelength range and versions excluding the saturated region. We further test the effect of including three different cloud-opacity parameterisations. Differences among JWST/NIRSpec data-reduction pipelines lead to substantial variations in retrieved atmospheric properties of WASP-39b, often exceeding one order of magnitude, comparable to uncertainties from modelling assumptions. Excluding the saturated region reduces inter-pipeline dispersion but increases parameter degeneracies. This highlights the need for robust and homogeneous calibration strategies. The results also confirm that JWST data possess the sensitivity required to probe aerosol spectral behaviour, although such constraints remain strongly dependent on the adopted data-reduction strategy.
#### Heavy interstellar scattering toward the near end of the Galactic bar

 - **Abstract**
 We present results of a pilot observational wide-field VLBI campaign on probing scattering properties of the partly ionized interstellar medium towards the Galactic plane sky region between $28^\circ<l<36^\circ$ and $|b|<1^\circ$. This covers the region where the Galactic bar connects to the spiral arms and where a lot of star formation is currently ongoing. The Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) observations of the whole region were performed in a special mode with multiple phase centers at L-band (1.4 -- 1.8 GHz) during April-June 2022 and a year later complemented by sessions at S (2.2 -- 2.4 GHz) and C-band (4.6 -- 5.0 GHz) partially covering the pilot region. We found compelling evidence that target sources are subject to scattering. The total detection rate in L, S and C-bands is 1.5, 3.4 and 9.2 per cent, respectively, and approximately scales with the square of the observation frequency. The low rate values imply that scattering is strong. Its power is non-uniform across the Galactic plane and it can be approximated by a Gaussian with a width of about $2^\circ$ peaking at the Galactic mid-plane. One of the brightest sources of the field shows anisotropic scattering, with a $\lambda^2$ dependence of its observed angular size, along a position angle of $26^\circ$ aligned with the line of constant Galactic latitude. We estimate the turbulence dissipation scale $r_\text{in}\approx1500$ km toward the source J1833+0015.
#### Towards a Fully Automated Pipeline for Short-Term Forecasting of In Situ Coronal Mass Ejection Magnetic Field Structure

 - **Abstract**
 We present an automated pipeline for operational short-term forecasting of coronal mass ejection (CME) magnetic field structure at L1, coupling arrival time prediction, in situ detection, and iterative flux rope reconstruction, following near-real-time remote-sensing CME identification. The system is triggered by new entries in the CCMC DONKI database and first applies the drag-based ELEvo model to determine whether an Earth impact is expected and estimate arrival time. This estimate defines a temporal window constraining the search for CME signatures in real-time L1 in situ solar wind data, where the magnetic obstacle (MO) is automatically detected using the deep learning model ARCANE. Upon MO onset, iterative reconstructions with the semi-empirical flux rope model 3DCORE are performed, using a Monte Carlo fitting scheme, producing continuously updated forecasts of the remaining magnetic field profile. We evaluate the pipeline using 3870 archived DONKI entries and archived NOAA real-time in situ data from 2013-2025, assessing forecast performance at different stages of MO observation. For 61 events with an associated ground-truth counterpart in the ICMECAT catalog, forecasts based on initial MO data already achieve performance comparable to full-event reconstructions. Typical errors are ~5 hours in timing of magnetic field extrema and ~10 nT in field strength metrics, with limited systematic improvement as more of the event is observed. Results show substantial event variability and systematic underestimation of extrema, indicating deviations from ideal flux rope assumptions. These findings demonstrate the potential of fully autonomous real-time forecasting while highlighting limitations imposed by event complexity and model representational capacity.
#### Mapping plasma properties of Cassiopeia A with XRISM/Resolve: a Bayesian analysis via UltraSPEX

 - **Abstract**
 Mapping the physical conditions of the shocked plasma of young supernova remnants (SNR) is crucial for understanding their explosion mechanisms, ejecta structure, and large-scale asymmetries. Using $>350$ ks of XRISM/Resolve high spectral resolution observations of Cassiopeia A (Cas A), the youngest known Galactic core-collapse SNR, we present the first microcalorimeter-based plasma parameter maps of any SNR. We tessellate Cas A into $1'\times1'$ regions and fit the broadband spectra as thermal emission from two pure-metal ejecta components -- corresponding to intermediate-mass elements (IMEs) and iron-group elements (IGEs) -- plus nonthermal synchrotron radiation. For robust inference, we introduce UltraSPEX, a Bayesian framework that couples the SPEX plasma code with the UltraNest nested-sampling algorithm, yielding full posterior distributions and exploration of parameter degeneracies. Key findings include enhanced Ar/Si and Ca/Si abundance ratios near the base of the Si-rich jets, and a high Ni/Fe mass ratio ($0.08\pm0.015$) in the base of NE jet. IGEs ejecta exhibit systematically higher Doppler velocities and broadenings than IMEs ejecta in most regions, with maximum differences of $\sim800$ km/s and $\sim1200$ km/s, respectively; Ca shows distinct (faster) kinematics from other IMEs in several SE regions. The ionization timescale and electron temperature show a robust anti-correlation, particularly for IGEs. This relation and measured parameter values could be explained by semi-analytical models with significant ejecta clumping (overdensities of $\sim10$ for IGEs and up to $\sim100$ for IMEs) and reduced historical reverse-shock velocities. Nonthermal emission accounts for a substantial fraction, with at least 47% of the 4--6 keV continuum and dominates in the western regions, where the spectrum hardens.

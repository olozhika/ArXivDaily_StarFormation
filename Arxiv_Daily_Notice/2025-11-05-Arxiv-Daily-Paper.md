#### The interstellar flux gap: From dust to kilometer-scale objects
 - **Authors:** Eloy Peña-Asensio, Darryl Z. Seligman
 - **Subjects:** Subjects:
Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA)
 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01957

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.01957

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Three kilometer-sized interstellar objects (ISOs) have been detected transiting the Solar System, and spacecraft have directly measured micrometer-scale interstellar dust (ISD). Yet no intermediate-size interstellar meteoroids have been identified in current meteor surveys. Aims. We test whether a power-law flux extrapolation connecting spacecraft ISD and kilometer-scale ISOs is consistent with meteor surveys, and we quantify the expected interstellar impacting flux based on various observational reports. Methods. We compiled differential fluxes and limits from spacecraft ISD, radar and optical meteor surveys, and theoretical estimates. We evaluated the power-law size-frequency fits, computed the 3I-like flux, and compared measured fluxes to predictions. Results. The spacecraft-measured dust flux exceeds extrapolations constrained by meteor surveys and kilometer-scale ISOs by $\sim$2-7 orders of magnitude. An $r^{-3.0}$ fit combining spacecraft ISD detections with kilometer-scale ISOs overpredicts the number of meteors with hyperbolic orbits, whereas slopes of $r^{-2.7}$-$r^{-2.3}$ (derived from radar and optical meteor upper limits, respectively) instead yield interplanetary-to-interstellar flux ratios of $10^{3}$-$10^{6}$. Conclusions. A simple power-law from ISD to ISOs is inconsistent with meteor survey constraints and yields unrealistic predictions for interstellar meteoroids. The data reveal a gap between submicron dust entrained in the Local Interstellar Cloud (LIC) and macroscopic bodies ejected from planetary systems. This gap may reflect distinct origins and destruction-transport processes rather than a continuous size-frequency distribution. This would imply either the dominance of a small-particle LIC component or the need to reassess spacecraft dust fluxes.

 - **Subjects:** Subjects:
Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Machine Learning (cs.LG)

 - **Abstract**
 We present a detailed study of Bayesian inference workflows for pulsar timing array data with a focus on enhancing efficiency, robustness and speed through the use of normalizing flow-based nested sampling. Building on the Enterprise framework, we integrate the i-nessai sampler and benchmark its performance on realistic, simulated datasets. We analyze its computational scaling and stability, and show that it achieves accurate posteriors and reliable evidence estimates with substantially reduced runtime, by up to three orders of magnitude depending on the dataset configuration, with respect to conventional single-core parallel-tempering MCMC analyses. These results highlight the potential of flow-based nested sampling to accelerate PTA analyses while preserving the quality of the inference.

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.01981

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate if systems of multiple Lyman-alpha emitters (LAEs) can serve as a proxy for dark matter halo mass, assess how their radiative properties relate to the underlying halo conditions, and explore the physics of star formation activity in LAEs and its relation to possible physically related companions. We use data from the One-hundred-deg$^2$ DECam Imaging in Narrowbands (ODIN) survey, which targets LAEs in three narrow redshift slices. We identify physically associated LAE multiples in the COSMOS field at $z = 2.4$, $z = 3.1$, and $z=4.5$, and use a mock catalog from the IllustrisTNG100 simulation to assess the completeness and contamination affecting the resulting sample of LAE multiples. We then study their statistical and radiative properties as a function of multiplicity, where we adopt the term multiplicity to refer to the number of physically associated LAEs. We find a strong correlation between LAE multiplicity and host halo mass in the mocks, with higher multiplicity systems preferentially occupying more massive halos. In both ODIN and the mock sample, we find indications that the mean Ly$\alpha$ luminosity and UV magnitude of LAEs in multiples increase with multiplicity. The halo-wide LAE surface brightness densities in Ly$\alpha$ and UV increase with multiplicity, reflecting more compact and actively star-forming environments. The close agreement between the model and ODIN observations supports the validity of the Ly$\alpha$ emission model in capturing key physical processes in LAE environments. Finally, a subhalo-based perturbation induced star formation model reproduces the minimum subhalo mass distribution in simulations at $z=2.4$, suggesting that local perturbations, rather than the presence of LAE companions, drive star formation in these systems. For the higher redshifts, neighbor perturbations do not seem to be the main driver that triggers star formation.
#### GMCs and Star Formation in the Galaxy: I. Effects of an HII region on a GMC
 - **Authors:** David Hollenbach, Antonio Parravano, Christopher McKee

Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA)
 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02061

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.02061

 - **Abstract**
 The destruction of Giant Molecular Clouds is a key component in galaxy evolution. We theoretically model the destruction of GMCs by HII regions, which evaporate ionized gas and eject neutral gas during their expansion. HII regions follow one of three tracks, depending on the EUV luminosity, $S$, of the ionizing OB association: the expansion can stall inside the cloud; it can break out, forming a blister (champagne) flow; or, for $S>S_{\rm com}$, it can result in the formation of a cometary cloud. We present results for the accumulated mass loss, $M_{\rm loss}(t)$, and the final mass loss, $M_{{\rm loss},f}$, by evaporation and ejection for a range of cloud masses ($10^4<M<10^{7}$ M$_\odot$), cloud surface densities ($50<\Sigma<1000$ M$_\odot$ pc$^{-2}$), OB association luminosities ($10^{44}<S<10^{52}$ s$^{-1}$), and off-center position of the association. We do not consider starbursts; our neglect of radiation pressure restricts our treatment to $S<10^{52} [(M/10^6$ M$_\odot)^{0.3})/(\Sigma /100$ M$_\odot$ pc$^{-2}$)] s$^{-1}$, and our neglect of gravity restricts $(M/10^6$ M$_\odot$)($\Sigma/ 100$ M$_\odot$ pc$^{-2}) < 10$. We find that $M_{{\rm loss},f}$ for the range $0.1 < M_{{\rm loss},f}/M < 0.7$ , is proportional to $S^p$, where $p\sim 0.45-0.75$ depends on $M$, $\Sigma$, and association position. We find analytic fits to $S_{\rm com}$ as a function of $\Sigma$, $M$, and association position. $S> S_{\rm com}$ associations destroy at least 70% of the initial cloud. We find a critical cloud mass $M_{\rm survive}$ above which clouds never become cometary and lose $<$ 70% of their mass via a single association. Low mass clouds mostly lose mass via ejection of neutral gas.
#### Decoding the RVb Enigma of DF Cyg: Pulsations, Circumstellar Disks, and Post-RGB Evolution Revealed by Multi-Wavelength Observations

 - **Abstract**
 This investigation integrates five decades of ground-based photometric data from the AAVSO, AFOEV, ASAS, ASAS-SN, and SuperWASP surveys with recently acquired TESS observations, conducting a multi-wavelength and multi-phase photometric analysis to elucidate the complex nature of DF Cyg. For the first time, we analyze approximately four years of Kepler data alongside TESS observations. Furthermore, TESS observations obtained in 120-second cadence mode, constitute the highest-precision photometric dataset for DF Cyg to date. By isolating long-term trends in the TESS data, we quantified short-term variations in the fundamental pulsation frequency and its integer harmonics. The two alternating short-term cycles in the TESS light curve facilitated the unambiguous identification of seven previously undetected integer harmonics of the fundamental frequency in the power spectrum, providing critical new insights into the star's complex pulsation dynamics. A periodogram analysis of the combined ground- and space-based datasets revealed approximately 35 frequencies linked to both long- and short-term variability mechanisms. Stellar parameters derived from Gaia DR3 data specifically, luminosity and radius estimates based on Type II Cepheid PL and PR relations demonstrate consistency with values obtained through SED modeling. Complementary high-resolution spectroscopic analysis of DF Cyg yielded atmospheric parameters of Teff = 4781 K, logg = 1.74 dex, and [FeH] = -0.07 dex, further constraining physical characteristics of the star. This synthesis of multi-epoch, multi-instrument data advances the understanding of pulsational behavior and evolutionary status in RV Tauri systems. Our findings highlight DF Cyg as a critical benchmark for its class, as its characteristics bridge the gap between post-RGB systems in the Magellanic Clouds and higher-luminosity post-AGB stars.

 - **Abstract**
 Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are extremely bright, millisecond duration cosmic transients of unknown origin. The growing number of wide-field and high-time-resolution radio surveys, particularly with next-generation facilities such as the SKA and MeerKAT, will dramatically increase FRB discovery rates, but also produce data volumes that overwhelm conventional search pipelines. Real-time detection thus demands software that is both algorithmically robust and computationally efficient. We present Astroflow, an end-to-end, GPU-accelerated pipeline for single-pulse detection in radio time-frequency data. Built on a unified C++/CUDA core with a Python interface, Astroflow integrates RFI excision, incoherent dedispersion, dynamic-spectrum tiling, and a YOLO-based deep detector. Through vectorized memory access, shared-memory tiling, and OpenMP parallelism, it achieves 10x faster-than-real-time processing on consumer GPUs for a typical 150 s, 2048-channel observation, while preserving high sensitivity across a wide range of pulse widths and dispersion measures. These results establish the feasibility of a fully integrated, GPU-accelerated single-pulse search stack, capable of scaling to the data volumes expected from upcoming large-scale surveys. Astroflow offers a reusable and deployable solution for real-time transient discovery, and provides a framework that can be continuously refined with new data and models.

 - **Abstract**
 We analyze the hierarchical structure in the Rosette Molecular Cloud (RMC) using $^{13}$CO J=1-0 data from the Milky Way Imaging Scroll Painting (MWISP) survey with a non-binary Dendrogram algorithm that allows multiple branches to emerge from parent structures. A total of 588 substructures are identified, including 458 leaves and 130 branches. The physical parameters of the substructures, including peak brightness temperature ($T_{\rm peak}$), brightness temperature difference ($T_{\rm diff}$), radius ($R$), mass ($M$), velocity dispersion ($\sigma_v$), and surface density ($\Sigma$), are characterized. The $T_{\rm peak}$ and $T_{\rm diff}$ distributions follow exponential functions with characteristic values above $5\sigma_{\rm RMS}$. The statistical properties and scaling relations, i.e., $\sigma_v$-$R$, $M$-$R$, and $\sigma_v$-$R\Sigma$ relations are in general consistent with those from traditional segmentation methods. The mass and radius follow power-law distributions with exponents of 2.2-2.5, with slightly flatter slopes for substructures inside the HII region. The velocity dispersion scales weakly with radius ($\sigma_v \propto R^{0.45\pm 0.03}$, $r = 0.58$), but shows a tighter correlation with the product of surface density and size ($\sigma_v \propto (\Sigma R)^{0.29\pm 0.01}$, $r = 0.73$). Self-gravitating substructures are found across scales from $\sim$0.2 to 10 pc, and nearly all structures with peak brightness above 4 K are gravitationally bound ($\alpha_{\rm vir} < 2$). The fraction of bound structures increases with mass, size, and surface density, supporting the scenario of global hierarchical collapse (GHC) for the evolution of molecular clouds, in which molecular clouds and their substructures are undergoing multiscale collapse.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we estimated the physical and geometrical characteristics of the visually close binary stellar system Hip 45571, using Al-Wardat's method for analyzing binary and multiple stellar systems. We estimated the physical properties of the components of the system for the four measured parallax given by Gaia and Hipparcos, which gives a dynamical mass sum ranges between 2.43 and 2.52 solar mass using the new orbital parameters following Tokovinin's dynamical method. The method used is a spectrophotometrical computational technique that employs Kurucz plane-parallel line-blanketed model atmospheres for single stars. These model atmospheres are used to construct the synthetic spectral energy distributions (SED) of each component and for the entire system. To ensure the method's accuracy, we apply the fit between synthetic and observational photometry under different filters, including the recently published Gaia DR3 measurements. The positions of the components on the H-R diagram and the evolutionary tracks were used to estimate their masses and ages. We found that the system consists of 2.24 Gyr two F2.5 IV and F3.5 IV subgiant components with T_eff_A= 6800, T_eff_B= 6700, logg=4.19 m/s^2, logg=4.33 m/s^2, R_A=1.77 R_sun, R_B=1.34 R_sun, L_A=6.01 L_sun, L_B=3.25 L_sun and Z=0.011. Depending on the masses estimated by Al-Wardat's method, a new parallax value of 28.72+-0.30 mas was obtained. Which lies between the values given by DR2 and DR3. This research underscores the importance of precision and reliability in employing these methods and measurements in a dynamic context, deepening our understanding of such stellar systems.
#### Supernova Classification using the Recurrent Neural Network in the CSST Ultra-Deep Field Survey

 - **Abstract**
 We study supernova (SN) classification using the machine learning method of the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) in the Chinese Space Station Survey Telescope Ultra-Deep Field (CSST-UDF) photometric survey, and explore the improvement of the cosmological constraint. We generate the mock light curve data of Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) and core collapse supernova (CCSN) using SNCosmo with SALT3 SN Ia model and CCSN templates, and apply the SuperNNova (SNN) program for classifying SNe. Our study indicates that the SNN combined with the Joint Light-curve Analysis like (JLA-like) cuts can enhance the purity of the CSST-UDF SN Ia sample up to over 99.5% with 2,193 SNe Ia and 4 CCSNe, which can significantly increase the reliability of the cosmological constraint results. The method based on the Bayesian Estimation Applied to Multiple Species (BEAMS) with Bias Corrections (BBC) framework is used to correct the SN Ia magnitude bias caused by the selection effect and CCSN contamination, and the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method is employed for cosmological constraints. We find that the accuracy of the constraints on the matter density $\Omega_{\rm M}$ and the equation of state of dark energy $w$ can achieve 14% and 18%, respectively, assuming the flat $w$CDM model. This result is comparable to that from the current surveys that relied on spectroscopic confirmation. It indicates that our data analysis method is effective, and the CSST-UDF SN photometric survey is powerful in exploring the expansion history of the Universe.

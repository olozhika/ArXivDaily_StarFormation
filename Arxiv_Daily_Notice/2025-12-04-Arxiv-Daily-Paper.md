 - **Abstract**
 We consider an isolated Gaussian velocity vortex perturbation in an otherwise quiescent, electrically conducting, and rotating fluid permeated by a uniform magnetic field $\bf{B}$. Studies suggest a presence of strong azimuthal wave motions on the timescale of centuries within the Earth's liquid outer core at higher latitudes. To understand these long-period oscillations, we focus on magnetostrophic waves, a slow component of magnetic-Coriolis waves with $\bf{B}$ orthogonally aligned with the rotation vector $\bf{\Omega}$, which replicate the field lines in the azimuthal direction. We present an analytical solution to the magnetic-Coriolis wave equation in Cartesian coordinates. Later, with numerical solution, we validate our analytical estimates and show that magnetostrophic waves travel relatively faster along the magnetic field when $\bf{B} \perp \bf{\Omega}$ compared with the case when both are aligned. The study confirms that with a magnetic field $\bf{B}$ orthogonally aligned to the rotation vector $\bf{\Omega}$, wave vectors satisfying the condition $\bf{\Omega}\cdot\bf{k} \approx 0$, travel with Alfvén velocities along the magnetic field lines as a component of inertial-Alfvén waves. The timescales on which Alfvén waves travel are relatively short, and it is also less likely that inertial-Alfvén waves will be sustained inside the core at higher latitudes \citep{Davidson2017}. This study shows that, excluding the inertial-Alfvén waves contribution ($k_z\neq 0$), there exists intensified magnetostrophic wave propagation when $\bf{B} \perp \bf{\Omega}$, which can explain the strong periodic oscillations on the time scales of centuries along the azimuthal field at higher latitudes. Results show persistence of the magnetostrophic waves despite the lower Lehnert number $Le$, suggesting the plausible existence of a low-intensity azimuthal magnetic field in the Earth's core.

 - **Abstract**
 Observations of massive star-forming regions show that classical stellar wind models over-predict the luminosity of the X-ray emitting gas, indicating a significant fraction of wind energy is lost. In this paper, we present a multi-wavelength analysis of the giant HII region 30 Doradus and its central star cluster R136 using 2 Ms of Chandra X-ray Observatory data, combined with James Webb Space Telescope and Hubble Space Telescope imaging and Spitzer spectral-energy distributions, to investigate how the hot gas energy is lost through turbulent mixing, radiative cooling, and physical leakage. We compare the spatial and spectral properties of the hot gas with those of the warm ionized gas and dust. We find no significant correlation between the dust and hot gas temperatures, suggesting they are not directly coupled and that the dust resides in the swept-up shells where it is heated radiatively. H$\alpha$ and X-ray surface brightness profiles show that the X-rays peak interior to the H$\alpha$ shells, demonstrating partial confinement of the hot gas. The fragmented shell structure and bright X-ray interior that declines near the H$\alpha$ shell reflect efficient cooling from turbulent mixing at the hot-cold interface. We compare against recent simulations of stellar-feedback driven bubbles which have broad agreement with the morphology of the X-ray and H$\alpha$ emission, but the simulations produce a dip in the interior X-ray surface brightness and a lack of hard X-rays compared to the observations. These differences may suggest thermal conduction is important as mass-loading of the hot bubble could reproduce the X-ray observables.
#### A Wind-Driven Origin for the Firework Morphology of the Supernova Remnant Pa 30

 - **Abstract**
 Pa 30 -- the likely remnant of the Galactic type Iax supernova of 1181 AD -- displays an unusual, firework-like morphology, consisting of radial filaments extending from a common center, where a white dwarf (WD) currently drives a very fast wind (speed $\gtrsim 10^{4}$ km s$^{-1}$). We propose the filaments arose from the Rayleigh-Taylor-unstable nature of the interface between the circumstellar medium (CSM) and the shocked wind launched by the natal WD; the filaments then elongated intact due to the Kelvin-Helmholtz-stable nature of the large initial density contrast between the wind and CSM, supplemented by the slowly declining wind density profile (relative to homologously expanding ejecta). To support this interpretation, we present two-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations and derive the filament properties, including their speed, density, and temperature, all of which are consistent with observations. We suggest the filaments elongate until the wind and CSM densities become comparable at the contact discontinuity, which occurs within 1--10 years, and then truncate because the RTI halts. The subsequent KHI growth timescale across the current width of the filaments is longer than the age of Pa 30, so they remain intact. The filament-less central region in Pa 30 is therefore more likely a consequence of the finite timescale over which the RTI operates, rather than a wind termination shock. In general, firework-like filaments may form in other systems, provided there is a sufficiently large density contrast between the ejecta and its surroundings.
#### High-angular-resolution ALMA imaging of the inhomogeneous dynamical atmosphere of the asymptotic giant branch star W Hya

 - **Abstract**
 We present high-angular-resolution imaging of the asymptotic giant branch star W Hya with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) to probe the dynamics and chemistry in the atmosphere and inner wind. W Hya was observed with the longest baselines of ALMA at 250-268 GHz with an angular resolution of ~17x20 mas. ALMA's high angular resolution allowed us to resolve the stellar disk of W Hya, along with clumpy, irregularly shaped emission extending to ~100 mas: plume in the north-northwest, a tail in the south-southwest, and the extended atmosphere elongated in the east-northeast--west-southwest direction, with semimajor and semiminor axes of ~70 and 40 mas (~3.4 and 1.9 Rstar), respectively. We identified 57 lines, which include SiO, H2O, SO2, SO, HCN, AlO, AlOH, TiO, TiO2, OH, and some of their isotopologues. The molecular line images show spatially inhomogeneous molecular formation. Our ALMA data taken at phase 0.53 (minimum light) indicate global, accelerating infall within ~75 mas (3.6 Rstar) but also outflow at up to ~10 km/s in deeper layers. While 38 of the detected lines appear in absorption against the continuum stellar disk as expected, we detect nonthermal emission on top of the continuum over the stellar disk in 19 lines of SiO, H2O, SO2, and AlO. The emission of SiO, AlO, TiO, TiO2, SO, and SO2 coincides well with the clumpy dust cloud distribution obtained from contemporaneous visible polarimetric imaging in addition to H2O reported in our previous work. This lends support to the idea that SiO, H2O, and AlO are directly involved in grain nucleation. The overlap of SO/SO2 (possibly also TiO/TiO2) with the dust clouds suggests the formation of these molecules and dust behind shocks induced by pulsation and/or convection. We detect HCN emission close to the star, down to ~30 mas (~1.4 Rstar), which is consistent with shock-induced chemistry.

 - **Abstract**
 Solar flares emit X rays and high-energy (MeV-GeV) ions (Solar Energetic Particles, or SEPs). Astronomical observations show solar mass-protostellar fluxes are a factor $\Phi \approx 3 \times 10^2 - 3 \times 10^3$ times higher than the present-day Sun. Constraining $\Phi$ in the early solar system is important for modeling ionization in the Sun's protoplanetary disk, the extent of magnetorotational instability or magnetocentrifugal outflows, or even production of short-lived radionuclides. Recent interpretations of meteoritic data -- cosmogenic Ne in hibonite grains, initial $({}^{10}{\rm Be}/{}^{9}{\rm Be})_0$ ratios in Ca-rich, Al-rich inclusions (CAIs), or even inferences of live ${}^{7}{\rm Be}$ in CAIs -- have suggested values $\Phi > 10^5$, even as large as $\Phi \approx 6 \times 10^6$, which would make the young Sun extraordinarily active, even for a protostar. We constrain $\Phi$ by re-examining these data. We conclude: cosmogenic Ne was produced in hibonite grains as they resided in the disk; ${}^{36}{\rm Cl}$ was created in Cl-poor grains after the disk dissipated; ${}^{10}{\rm Be}$ was inherited from the molecular cloud, with almost no ($< 1\%$) ${}^{10}{\rm Be}$ created in the disk; and there is no evidence whatsoever for any live ${}^{7}{\rm Be}$ in CAIs. We show these data are consistent with a value $\Phi \approx 3 \times 10^3$ for the first $> 5$ Myr of the solar nebula. The early Sun evidently emitted a flux of X rays and SEPs not atypical for a protostar.
#### Comparison of Ne-22 core and shell distilled WD detonations in AREPO

 - **Abstract**
 We present three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of detonations in $1.0 \mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ white dwarfs that have undergone $^{22} \mathrm{Ne}$ distillation during crystallisation. These simulations, conducted with the moving-mesh code AREPO, aim to investigate the effects of chemical separation on the ejecta and spectra of such WDs undergoing thermonuclear explosions. The distillation process alters the internal chemical stratification of the star, concentrating neutron-rich material either in a central core or in an interior shell. We model both configurations as well as a homogeneous equivalent for each case with the same $^{22} \mathrm{Ne}$ content distributed evenly at all radii. Despite similar $^{56} \mathrm{Ni}$ yields between the core and shell models ($0.40$ and $0.45 \mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ respectively), the two models yield markedly different iron-group abundances. Both distilled models showed significantly enhanced production of $^{15} \mathrm{N}$ via the decay of $^{15} \mathrm{O}$. The $^{22} \mathrm{Ne}$-core model produces enhanced amounts of stable neutron-rich iron-group isotopes such as $^{58} \mathrm{Ni}$ and $^{54} \mathrm{Fe}$. We highlight observational signatures associated with these differences, including potentially enhanced [$\mathrm{Ni}_{\rm II}$] lines in nebular spectra. Synthetic TARDIS spectra at early times show only moderate differences. Our results suggest that white dwarf distillation, a process linked to delayed cooling in the Gaia Q branch population, may leave detectable nucleosynthetic fingerprints in a subset of Type Ia supernovae. These findings open additional pathways to probe progenitor evolution and the role of crystallisation in shaping the diversity of thermonuclear transients.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the effects of the nearby interstellar medium (ISM) on the locally measured cosmic-ray (CR) spectra. Using the GALPROP code we explore how variations in the local gas and source distributions affect spectral features at low energies. Comparing with recent Voyager 1 data taken in the local ISM, we show that for a realistic interstellar gas distribution, the nearest source of the low energy CR particles observed nearby the Solar system is constrained to be within the range ~150-200 pc distant. We find that the modelling supports the conclusion of Cummings et al. (2025) that there is a significant fraction of primary Boron in its observed spectrum at low energies. Our study shows that detailed modelling of the immediate Galactic environment is required to robustly infer Galactic CR propagation parameters from local measurements, and that accounting for nearby ISM structure can alleviate tensions between direct CR data and global propagation models.
#### A Deep Chandra X-ray Survey of a Luminous Quasar Sample at $z\sim$ 7

 - **Abstract**
 We present new Chandra observations of seven luminous quasars at $z>6.5$. Combined with archival Chandra observations of all other known quasars, they form nearly complete X-ray observations of all currently known $z\sim7$ quasars with $M_{1450}<-26.5$, except for J0313$-$1806 at $z=7.642$ and J0910$-$0414 at $z=6.636$. Together with existing ground-based NIR spectroscopy and ALMA observations, we investigate the correlations between X-ray emission (the X-ray luminosity $L_{\rm X}$ and the optical/UV-to-X-ray spectral slope $\alpha_{\rm OX}$) and various quasar properties (rest-UV luminosity $L_{\mathrm{2500\ \mathring{A}}}$, bolometric luminosity $L_{\rm bol}$, C IV blueshift, and infrared luminosity $L_{\rm IR}$). We find most $z>6.5$ quasars follow a similar $\alpha_{\rm OX}-L_{\mathrm{2500\ \mathring{A}}}$ relation as $z\sim1-6$ quasars, but also display a large scatter. We find a potential correlation between $\alpha_{\rm OX}$ and the C IV blueshift, suggesting a soft optical/UV-to-X-ray SED shape is frequently associated with fast disk winds. Furthermore, we analyze the X-ray spectrum of 11 quasars at $z>6.5$ with Chandra detection, and find the best-fit photon index $\Gamma$ is $2.41\pm0.27$, which is likely driven by high accretion rates of $z>6.5$ quasars. In addition, we find there are no significant correlations between either $L_{\rm X}$ and $L_{\rm IR}$, nor $L_{\rm bol}$ and $L_{\rm IR}$, suggesting no strong correlations between quasar luminosity and star formation luminosity for the most luminous quasars at $z>6.5$.

 - **Abstract**
 This paper presents an analysis of noise transients observed in LIGO data during the first part of the fourth observing run, using the unsupervised machine learning technique t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) to examine the behavior of glitch groups. Based on the t-SNE output, we apply Agglomerative Clustering in combination with the Silhouette Score to determine the optimal number of groups. We then track these groups over time and investigate correlations between their occurrence and environmental or instrumental conditions. At the Livingston observatory, the most common glitches during O4a were seasonal and associated with ground motion, whereas at Hanford, the most prevalent glitches were related to instrumental conditions.
#### Dynamical and Photometric Analysis of NGC 146 and King 14: Evidence for a Co-Moving, Unbound Cluster Pair

 - **Abstract**
 To understand the nature of the NGC 146-King 14 cluster pair, we conducted a detailed photometric, astrometric, and dynamical study using multiwavelength data from Gaia DR3, Pan-STARRS1, WISE, and TESS. Using a probabilistic approach, we identified 770 and 690 high-probability members of NGC 146 and King 14, respectively. Both clusters exhibit well-defined radial density profiles consistent with King models. We estimate the cluster ages as 20 $\pm$ 5 Myr and 50 $\pm$ 10 Myr from isochrone fitting, and distances of 2.98 $\pm$ 0.33 kpc and 2.51 $\pm$ 0.23 kpc from parallaxes after applying the Bailer-Jones criteria. The clusters show consistent mean proper motions. The mass function slopes (1.51 $\pm$ 0.18 and 1.50 $\pm$ 0.15) are close to the Salpeter value, and the extinction follows a normal Galactic reddening law (RV ~ 3.1). Three-dimensional mapping gives a projected separation of ~ 9 pc. Orbit integration using the galpy MWPotential2014 model shows that NGC 146 and King 14 move in nearly circular, disk-like orbits with similar mean orbital radii (Rm ~ 9 kpc) and orbital periods of roughly 255 Myr. A dynamical separation of ~ 32 pc indicates that both clusters share a common spatial and kinematic association, consistent with a co-moving pair. However, their relative velocity exceeds the escape velocity set by their combined mass, indicating they are not gravitationally bound. TESS light curves reveal seven variable stars, including $\gamma$ Doradus, SPB stars, and eclipsing binaries, though only one is a likely member. Overall, the clusters likely formed within the same giant molecular cloud and now exist as an unbound co-moving pair.

 - **Abstract**
 The NSF-DOE Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), beginning full operations in late 2025, will dramatically transform solar system science by vastly expanding discoveries and providing detailed characterization opportunities across all small body populations. This includes the co-orbiting 1:1 resonant Neptune Trojans, which are thought to be dynamically hot captures from the protoplanetary disk. Using the survey simulator $\texttt{Sorcha}$, combined with the latest LSST cadence simulations, we present the very first predictions for the Neptune Trojan yield within the LSST. We forecast a model-dependent median number of $\sim130-300$ discovered Neptune Trojans, and infer a notable 2:1 detection bias toward the recently emerged L5 cloud near the galactic plane versus the L4 cloud, reflecting the lower-cadence coverage in the Northern Ecliptic Spur region that suppresses L4 detections. The additionally simulated Science Validation survey will offer the very first early insights into this understudied cloud. Around 60\% of detected main survey Neptune Trojans will meet stringent color light curve quality criteria, increasing the sample size more than fourfold compared to existing datasets. This enhanced sample will enable robust statistical analyses of Neptune Trojan color and size distributions, crucial for understanding their origins and relationship to the broader trans-Neptunian population. These comprehensive color measurements represent a major step forward in characterizing the Neptune Trojan population and will facilitate future targeted spectroscopic observations.
#### X TrA through the eyes of MATISSE: More evidence of clumpy molecular layers around C-type asymptotic giant branch stars

 Aims. The goal of this study is to further the understanding of the wind formation mechanism in asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars through the analysis of the close environment (within a few stellar radii) of the carbon star X TrA. Methods. X TrA was observed for the first time with the Mid-Infrared SpectroScopic Experiment instrument (MATISSE) in the L and N bands in low spectral resolution mode (R=30), and its close surroundings were mapped in specific wavelength ranges corresponding to specific molecules ($C_2H_2$ and HCN, at 3.1 and 3.8 $\mu$m) and dust (amorphous carbon and, for example, Sic at 11.3 $\mu$m), via image reconstruction techniques. Results. The angular diameter of the star ranges from 10 mas in the L band pseudo-continuum (3.5 $\mu$m) to 20 mas at 3.1 and 11.3 $\mu$m. The reconstructed images show some mild elongated features (along the east-west direction) and asymmetric protrusions, which are most evident around 3.1 $\mu$m. Imaging results highlight the clumpy nature of the circumstellar environment, starting from the photospheric region up to more distant layers. Conclusions. The angular diameters found for X TrA in the image data are in agreement with previous photospheric diameter estimates (following VLTI/MIDI 8-13 $\mu$m observations), and their wavelength dependence is similar to values found for other carbon stars observed with MATISSE (R Scl and V Hya). The 3.1 $\mu$m images presented here show highly asymmetric features, another case of a C-rich star with irregular morphologies close to the stellar disk; this supports the notion that the $C_2H_2+HCN$ abundance distribution usually originates from a clumpy layer around carbon stars.

 - **Abstract**
 The primordial structure of Jupiter remains uncertain, yet it holds vital clues on the planet's formation and early evolution. Recent work used dynamical constraints from Jupiter's inner moons to determine its primordial state, thereby providing a novel, formation-era anchor point for interior modeling. Building on this approach, we combine these dynamical constraints with thermal evolution simulations to investigate which primordial structures are consistent with present-day Jupiter. We present 4,250 evolutionary models of the planetary structure, including compositional mixing and helium phase separation, spanning a broad range of initial entropies and composition profiles. We find that Jupiter's present-day structure is best explained by a warm ($4.98_{-2.57}^{+3.00}\, \mathrm{k_B\, m_u^{-1}}$), metal-rich dilute core inherited from formation. To simultaneously satisfy constraints on Jupiter's primordial spin, however, its envelope must have been significantly warmer ($9.32_{-0.58}^{+0.48}\, \mathrm{k_B\, m_u^{-1}}$) at the time of disk dispersal. We determine Jupiter's primordial radius to be $1.89_{-0.49}^{+0.40}\, \mathrm{R_J}$. These results provide new constraints on Jupiter's formation, suggesting that most heavy elements were accreted early during runaway gas accretion, and placing bounds on the energy dissipated during the accretion shock.

 - **Abstract**
 Although historically classified into discrete subclasses, there is growing evidence that indicates that core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) categories often overlap, reflecting continuous variations in progenitor structure, mass-loss history, and circumstellar environments rather than strictly distinct channels. In this review, we explore the proposed continua that link hydrogen-rich Type II SNe to stripped-envelope explosions (IIb-Ib-Ic), and that extend further into interaction-dominated and superluminous events. We discuss the physical processes-stellar winds, binary interaction, eruptive outbursts, and circumstellar interaction-that may produce graded outcomes across classes, while highlighting where observational evidence supports or challenges smooth transitions. We propose that CCSNe are better viewed as a multidimensional continuum of explosion outcomes, where traditional subclasses act as reference points rather than strict boundaries. Future progress will rely on large, homogeneous datasets and advanced modeling to disentangle true evolutionary sequences from apparent overlaps, ultimately connecting progenitor pathways to the observed diversity of explosions

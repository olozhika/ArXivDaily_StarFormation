 - **Abstract**
 Understanding the Milky Way disc formation requires characterising its structural and kinematic properties as functions of stellar age. Using red giant stars from APOGEE DR17 and Gaia DR3, we model the age-dependent stellar kinematics with a quasi-isothermal distribution function and fit disc parameters as a function of age using non-parametric splines. We identify a transition from thick to thin disc populations around 10 Gyr ago. Stars older than this have short scale lengths ($\sim$1.7 kpc), typical of the thick disc, while younger stars exhibit increasing scale length with decreasing age, consistent with inside-out formation of the thin disc. This transition coincides with the end of the starburst triggered by the Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus (GSE) merger. Stars formed around 10 Gyr ago exhibit a dip in scale length, even shorter than that of the thick disc. Comparison with an Auriga simulation suggests that this scale-length dip reflects gas disc shrinking caused by the transition from a cold to hot gas accretion mode. We propose the following disc formation scenario: (1) the thick disc formed under cold-mode accretion; (2) the GSE merger triggered a starburst and increased the total mass of the Galaxy, causing the transition to hot-mode accretion; (3) rapid gas consumption led to temporary shrinking of the star-forming gas disc; and then (4) thin disc grows in an inside-out fashion, as the size of the star-forming gas disc grows via hot-mode smooth gas accretion.

 - **Abstract**
 Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are brief, high-energy bursts of radio waves from extragalactic sources, and their origin remains an open question. In this paper, we perform a comprehensive analysis of the FRB population using the first CHIME/FRB catalog, focusing on their energy and redshift distribution, with careful consideration of selection effects. We investigate a range of models, including the Schechter function and the broken power-law function for the energy distribution, and several redshift evolution models, such as the star formation history (SFH) model, as well as models incorporating time delays relative to the SFH or additional redshift evolution factors. Our results indicate that the energy distribution of FRBs is best described by the Schechter function, with a power-law index of $\gamma = -1.49^{+0.37}_{-0.27}$ and a characteristic cutoff energy of $E_\mathrm{c} = 2.82^{+2.43}_{-1.47} \times 10^{41}$ erg. Furthermore, we find no evidence for redshift evolution in the energy distribution of FRBs. In terms of their redshift distribution, our analysis shows that it follows the cosmic SFH, without requiring additional delayed components or redshift evolution factors, suggesting that most FRBs likely originate from young stellar populations. Simultaneously, we infer a local volumetric rate of $\Phi_0 = 4.68^{+4.66}_{-2.39} \times 10^{4} \rm \ Gpc^{-3}yr^{-1}$ for $E>10^{39}$ erg. These results, robust against CHIME observational biases, may provide new insights into the underlying properties of the FRB population.
#### A Melody in the Noise: Modeling Echoes of the Crab Nebula

 - **Abstract**
 Pulses from the Crab pulsar are often followed by ``echoes'', produced by radiation that was deflected by small filamentary structures in the Crab nebula and thus traveled via longer paths. We describe a simplified but detailed model that treats the filaments as cylinders of dense, neutral material with a thin ionized skin. In this picture, echoes are produced when the line of sight crosses the skin at glancing incidence, which naturally leads to the large electron column density gradients required to get the observed delays even with electron densities comparable to those inferred from optical line emission ratios. We compare the properties of the predicted echoes with those of a relatively isolated observed one identified during daily monitoring with CHIME. We find that the delays of the simulated echoes follow closely the near quadratic evolution known to be a feature of these echoes, and that, unlike in previous models, we match the characteristic observed asymmetry between incoming and outgoing arcs, with the size of the gap in between a consequence of the skin crossing time. However, our model fails to quantitatively reproduce the magnifications of the echoes. We believe this likely is because the filaments are not as smooth as envisaged, so that a given echo results from many images. Nevertheless, our results strongly support the hypothesis that the nebula is filled with small-scale filamentary structures, which may well be substructures of the larger filaments that are seen in optical images.
#### Exploring Mixing Thresholds in Asteroseismic Stellar Evolution Models

 - **Abstract**
 Inferences from observations clearly show that mixing in stars extends beyond the convective boundaries defined by mixing length theory. This triggered the proposal of a variety of prescriptions to include additional mixing in stellar models. These prescriptions typically introduce free parameters to set the extent of the additional mixing and may also introduce numerical parameters. In the case of exponential overshooting, one must decide the threshold at which the exponential decay of the mixing coefficient can be treated as zero. Using the MESA stellar evolution code, I explore the effect of varying this parameter on asteroseismic models of main-sequence stars with growing convective cores. From this, I conclude that overshoot_D_min should be set to $10^{-2}$ cm$^2$/s or lower for these stars. The default value in MESA is four orders of magnitude higher than this recommendation, which results in discontinuous evolution.
#### Hybrid Black Hole-Disk Driven Jets: Steady Axisymmetric Ideal MHD Modeling

 - **Abstract**
 Improved observational precision in relativistic jets has underscored the need for tractable theoretical models. In this study, we construct a semi-analytical hybrid jet model that incorporates both black hole-driven and disk-driven components within the framework of steady, axisymmetric, ideal MHD. We derive a condition that determines the launching sites of cold outflows, introducing a new constraint on the magnetic field configuration threading the accretion disk. Using the Bernoulli equation and critical point analysis, we derive flow solutions along various magnetic field lines. Our hybrid jet model shows that discontinuities in field-line angular velocity lead to clear velocity shear and density jumps at the interface between the two jet components. These features are accompanied by localized enhancements in velocity and density, potentially explaining the observed limb-brightening.

 - **Abstract**
 The formation of Neptune planets with orbital periods less than 10\,days remains uncertain. They might have developed similarly to longer-period counterparts, emerged from rare collisions between smaller planets, or could be the remnant cores of stripped giant planets. Characterizing a large number of them is important to advance our understanding of how they form and evolve. We aimed at confirming the planetary nature and characterizing the properties of a close-in Neptune-type transiting exoplanet candidate revealed by TESS around the star TOI-5795 (V = 10.7 mag), 162 pc away from the Sun. We monitored TOI-5795 with the HARPS spectrograph for two months to quantify periodic variations in radial velocity (RV) to estimate the mass of the smaller companion. We combined these RV and TESS photometry. High-angular-resolution speckle and adaptive optics imaging excluded contamination from nearby sources. We found that the parent star is a metal-poor (${\rm [Fe/H]}=-0.27\pm0.07$), G3\,V star ($T_{\rm eff}=5718\pm50$\,K), with $R_{\star}=1.082\pm0.026\,R_{\sun}$, $M_{\star}=0.901^{+0.055}_{-0.037}\,M_{\sun}$ and $10.2^{+2.5}_{-3.3}$\,Gyr. We estimated that the planet has an orbital period of $P_{\rm orb}=6.1406325 \pm 0.0000054$ days and an orbital eccentricity compatible with zero. Having a mass of $23.66^{+4.09}_{-4.60}\,M_{\oplus}$, a radius of $5.62\pm 0.11\,R_{\oplus}$ and an equilibrium temperature of $1136\pm18$\,K, it can be considered as a hot super-Neptune at the edge of the Neptune desert. We simulated planet-formation processes but found almost no successful matches to the observed planet's mass and orbit, suggesting that post-formation dynamical events may have shaped its current state.
#### Submillimeter Class II methanol masers near the massive protostar S255IR NIRS3: evolution and excitation of the $J_1 -J_0$ A$^{-+}$ series and a new maser line at 345.919 GHz

 - **Abstract**
 We present the results of the further investigation of the Class II methanol maser emission in the $14_1 - 14_0$ A$^{-+}$ transition at 349.1 GHz discovered in 2016 in the remarkable core S255IR-SMA1, harboring a $\sim$20 M$_\odot$ protostar NIRS3, which exhibited a disk-mediated accretion burst in 2015. The present study is based on the observations of this object with ALMA in Band 7 at the largest baselines, which provide the angular resolution of $\sim$15 mas. We estimated physical conditions in the region from which comes the maser emission, and in the surroundings, using the presumably quasi-thermal methanol lines in our bands and the CH$_3$CN $19_\mathrm{K} - 18_\mathrm{K}$ line series. The total flux density in the $14_1 - 14_0$ A$^{-+}$ line in 2021 is about two times higher than in 2019. A maser emission of about the same intensity in 2021 is detected for the first time in the $12_1 - 12_0$ A$^{-+}$ transition at 336.9 GHz. The physical conditions in the masering and non-masering regions are similar. The masers are apparently excited by the radiation of the central source. Unfortunately, the existing models cannot adequately take into account this radiation. The $18_{-3}-17_{-4}$ E transition at 345.919 GHz shows characteristics of maser emission, too.
#### Jet-Driven Formation of Bipolar Rings in Planetary Nebulae: Numerical Simulations Inspired by NGC 1514

 - **Abstract**
 We conduct three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of jets launched into a dense shell, reproducing two rings in a bipolar structure that resemble the two dusty rings of the planetary nebula (PN) NGC 1514. The scenario we simulate assumes that a strong binary interaction enhanced the mass loss rate from the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stellar progenitor of NGC 1514, and shortly thereafter, the main-sequence companion accreted mass from the AGB star, launching a pair of jets. We find that adiabatic flows, where radiative losses are negligible, produce prominent rings, as observed in the infrared in NGC 1514. In contrast, when radiative cooling is significant, the rings are thin and faint. Our results reinforce the prevailing notion that jets play a substantial role in shaping planetary nebulae (PNe). More generally, as the binary companion to the central star of NGC 1514 avoided common envelope evolution, our results suggest that jets play a major role in many binary systems experiencing stable mass transfer at high rates. This conclusion complements the view that jets play a significant role in unstable mass transfer, specifically in common envelope evolution. Studies of strongly interacting binary systems, whether stable or not, should include jets. If jets continue to be active after ring formation, the outcomes are circum-jet rings, as observed in some other PNe and core-collapse supernova remnants.

 - **Abstract**
 We present an overview of our recent results from the BLOeM campaign in the Small Magellanic Cloud ($Z=0.2\,{\rm Z}_{\odot}$). Using nine-epoch VLT/FLAMES spectroscopy, we investigated the multiplicity of 929 massive stars. Our findings reveal contrasting binary properties across evolutionary stages: O-type stars show an intrinsic close-binary fraction of $70\%$, and early B-type dwarfs/giants reach ${\sim80}\%$, exceeding higher-metallicity samples. In contrast, B0-B3 supergiants drop to ${\sim40}\%$, and A-F supergiants to ${\sim8}\%$; intrinsic variability likely inflates the latter, so the true multiplicity may be lower. OBe stars display distinct binary properties consistent with a post-interaction origin. These results have profound implications for massive-star evolution at low metallicity, including the production of exotic transients, gravitational-wave progenitors, and ionising radiation in the early Universe.

 - **Abstract**
 LTT-9779 b is an inhabitant of the hot Neptune desert and one of only a few planets with a measured high albedo. Characterising the atmosphere of this world is the key to understanding what processes dominate in creating the hot Neptune desert. We aim to characterise the reflected light of LTT-9779 b at high spectral resolution to break the degeneracy between clouds and atmospheric metallicity. This is key to interpreting its mass loss history which may illuminate how it kept its place in the desert. We use the high resolution cross-correlation spectroscopy technique on four half-nights of ESPRESSO observations in 4-UT mode (16.4-m effective mirror) to constrain the reflected light spectrum of LTT-9779 b. We do not detect the reflected light spectrum of LTT-9779 b despite these data having the expected sensitivity at the level 100 ppm. Injection tests on the post-eclipse data indicate that TiO should have been detected for a range of different equilibrium chemistry models. Therefore this non-detection suggests TiO depletion in the western hemisphere however, this conclusion is sensitive to temperature which impacts the chemistry in the upper atmosphere and the reliability of the line list. Additionally, we are able to constrain the top of the western cloud deck to $P_{\text{top, western}}<10^{-2.0}$ bar and the top of the eastern cloud deck $P_{\text{top, eastern}}<10^{-0.5}$ bar, which is consistent with the predicted altitude of MgSiO$_3$ and Mg$_2$SiO$_4$ clouds from JWST NIRISS/SOSS. While we do not detect the reflected light spectrum of LTT-9779 b, we have verified that this technique can be used in practice to characterise the high spectral resolution reflected light of exoplanets so long as their spectra contain a sufficient number of deep spectral lines. Therefore this technique may become an important cornerstone of exoplanet characterisation with the ELT and beyond.
#### Isolating the gravitational influence of Uranus's winds requires close passages inward of the rings

 - **Abstract**
 Close orbits by a Uranus Orbiter and Probe (UOP) could be used to deduce Uranus's multipolar gravity field to higher precision and angular degree than the J2 and J4 currently measured from ground-based ring occultations and the Voyager 2 flyby. We examine Jn sensitivity limits obtained from simulations of candidate UOP trajectories, pairing these with Uranus interior and wind models to perform retrievals from the gravity moments. We consider zonal wind profiles derived from recent feature-tracking data, assuming that zonal winds extend into the planet along cylinders, with a radial decay function similar to those that explain Jupiter and Saturn gravity. Present knowledge of J2 and J4 permits a fairly wide range of possible wind depths in Uranus, up to 1,800 km or 7% by radius. Measuring additional gravity moments is essential to separate this unknown wind depth from other interior properties of interest, but J6 is found to be too dominated by bulk rotation to be a useful probe of the wind depth. Odd moments arising from Uranus's observed north-south asymmetric flow are strong functions of the wind depth, but the usefulness of J3 is hindered by its sensitivity to present uncertainties in the wind profile. The even moment J8, or the odd moments J5 and J7, are the best probes of the depth of Uranus's winds. J8, and most likely J5 and J7, are measurable in a highly inclined orbit making >~10 pericenter passages inward of the $\zeta$ ring, approximately 1,000-2,500 km above Uranus's cloud tops.
#### Identification of Candidate Halos Hosting Massive Black Hole Seeds in the \textit{Renaissance} Simulations with Support Vector Machines

 - **Abstract**
 The nature of the origins of supermassive black holes remains uncertain. Multiple possible seeding pathways have been proposed across a variety of mass scales, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. One such channel is a direct collapse black hole (DCBH), thought to form from the deaths of supermassive stars in pristine atomic cooling halos in the early universe. In this work, we investigate the ability to identify halos likely to form a DCBH based on their properties using a support vector machine (SVM). We implement multiple methods to improve the accuracy of the model, including selecting subsets of critical features and optimizing SVM hyperparameters. We find that our best model requires quantities relevant to star formation, such as the metallicity, incident flux of Lyman-Werner radiation, and halo stellar mass. The SVMs produced from this work can serve as probabilistic and holistic seeding prescriptions for DCBHs in cosmological simulations.

 - **Abstract**
 To support the development of the data processing pipeline and the scientific performance assessment for the Cool Planet Imaging Coronagraph (CPI-C) on the China Space Station Telescope (CSST), we have developed the end-to-end instrument simulation program, CPISM. This paper details the core modules of CPISM that simulate the CPI-C instrument, focusing on the simulation of the high-contrast imaging optical system and the visible-band science camera. We modeled key optical components, such as the transmission apodizing filter, the wavefront corrector, and the focal plane mask using the HCIPy package. A $10^{-8}$ contrast dark hole region, consistent with design specifications, was simulated using the Electric Field Conjugation (EFC) optimization method, and broadband observation effects were considered. For the science camera, which is an electron multiplying charge-coupled device (EMCCD), we established a detailed model encompassing photon collection, charge transfer, electron multiplication (EM), and readout processes, based on test data. This model simulates complex instrumental features including dark current, charge transfer efficiency, clock-induced charge, multiplication noise factor, and various readout effects like striping and drift. We also proposed and validated an improved statistical model for the EM process to enhance simulation efficiency. CPISM can generate simulated images containing rich instrumental details, closely similar to the expected real observational data, thus laying the foundation for the development and verification of CPI-C data processing algorithms and preparations for future scientific research.
#### Detection of Lensed Gravitational Waves from dark matter halos with deep learning

 - **Abstract**
 Lensed gravitational waves (GWs) provide a new window into the study of dark matter substructures, yet the faint interference signatures they produce are buried in detector noise. To address this challenge, we develop a deep learning framework based on a residual one-dimensional convolutional neural network for lensed GW identification under multiband observations. The model directly processes multiband waveforms from binary neutron star systems, covering the early inspiral observed by the DECi-hertz Interferometer Gravitational wave Observatory (DECIGO) and the late inspiral observed by the Einstein Telescope (ET), corresponding approximately to the wave-optics and geometrical-optics regimes, respectively. It enables end-to-end classification of five classes: pure noise, unlensed GWs, and three representative lensed GWs corresponding to singular isothermal sphere (SIS), cored isothermal sphere (CIS), and Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profiles. A dataset of 10^6 simulated samples was constructed with signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) ranging from 5 to 100. The deep learning model with multiband observations achieves an accuracy of 97.0% and a macro-averaged F1 score of 0.97, significantly exceeding the single-detector performance, where DECIGO and ET reach 72.8% and 62.3%, respectively. Even in the low-SNR regime (SNR < 20), the model maintains an accuracy above 63%, while in the high-SNR regime (SNR > 80), its accuracy approaches 99.8%. These results demonstrate that multiband GW observations effectively enhance the detection of lensed GWs within complex noise environments, providing a robust and efficient pathway for the automated identification of lensed GWs in future multiband observations.
#### Interstellar medium phases and abundances in the central parsec: A JWST MIRI/MRS view of the Galactic center

 - **Abstract**
 We used newly obtained observations from the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) equipped with the Medium Resolution Spectrometer (MRS) aboard the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) to extract spectra covering the entire spectral range from 5 to 27~$\mu$m in the CND and in the CC. We used the photoionization code CLOUDY to generate synthetic spectra with the same spectral range and resolution, simulating a wide range of gas phases and abundances. We then determined the contribution of each phase to the spectra. Once the abundances and contribution from each phase of the gas were determined, we identified four dominant phases and performed a spatial analysis to determine their contribution to each spaxel of the datacubes. We find that in both the CND and the CC, the bulk of the emission originates from warm ionized gas with temperatures of between $10^4$ and $10^{4.8}$~K. In the CND, molecular gas contributes significantly to the flux and is spatially structured, while the CC shows minimal molecular gas content, as is expected from these regions. Coronal gas is detected in both regions at the interface between molecular and warm ionized gas. The observed abundance pattern (enhanced CNO and $\alpha$ elements with suppressed Fe) indicates a chemically young environment, recently enriched by core-collapse supernovae and stellar winds, with a limited contribution from older Type Ia supernovae. This favors a scenario of massive, recent star formation rather than cumulative long-term enrichment.
#### Recombination Clumping Factor of Physically Defined Intergalactic Medium at the Epoch of Reionization

 - **Abstract**
 The recombination clumping factor, $C$, is a key parameter in modeling cosmic reionization, but its value is sensitive to the definition of the Intergalactic Medium (IGM). We investigate the clumping factor using the GAMER adaptive mesh refinement cosmological hydrodynamical simulation code. We introduce a new, physically-motivated definition of the IGM based on the effective transmission factor of ionizing photons. We perform large-scale, full-box simulations with varying intensities of the uniform ultraviolet background, and we find that our physically-defined clumping factor is significantly lower than the values derived from traditional overdensity thresholds. We also introduce an analytic model that distinguishes between the volume-weighted and mass-weighted averages of the neutral fraction, and we find the difference in reionization timing of $\Delta z \sim 2$ depending on the assumed clumping factor and the relation between the volume-weighted and mass-weighted neutral fractions. Our zoom-in simulations further show that, while SN feedback increases the clumping factor locally, the effect is limited to $\sim 100$ kpc scales and does not significantly alter the global clumping factor. The substantially lower clumping factor reduces the required ionizing photon budget, potentially alleviating tension for reionization scenarios driven by rare, bright sources like active galactic nuclei.
#### Ultra extreme high-frequency-peaked BL Lacs: a potential population of MeV synchrotron blazars?

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the potential existence of a new population of BL Lacs, called ultra extreme high-energy-peaked BL Lacs (UEHBLs), whose synchrotron emission component peaks in the MeV band, extending the blazar sequence beyond its current limit. To model the spectral energy distribution of these new sources, we apply the hybrid shock-turbulence acceleration framework previously developed for extreme high-frequency-peaked BL Lacs. We present three representative realizations that produce synchrotron peaks between $0.2$ and $2$ MeV and evaluate their multiwavelenght signatures. Our results show that UEHBLs would be undetectable with current GeV (Fermi) and future TeV (CTA) facilities due to severe Klein-Nishina suppression of inverse Compton scattering, but are ideal targets for proposed MeV missions such as COSI, AMEGO-X, and e-ASTROGAM. We further identify a sample of hard X-ray sources from the Swift-BAT catalogs that exhibit the expected spectral properties of UEHBLs, potentially representing the first observational hints of this population. If confirmed, UEHBLs would provide unique insight into particle acceleration in relativistic jets, imposing strong constraints on the maximum achievable electron energies. We also discuss the expected polarization and variability signatures, including the possibility of synchrotron-driven thermal instabilities leading to MeV flares. These findings underscore the critical importance of the MeV band for discovering and characterizing the most extreme accelerators among blazars.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the processing of an observation of Sagittarius A (Sgr A) with the Tomographic Ionized-carbon Mapping Experiment (TIME), part of the 2021-2022 commissioning run to verify TIME's hyperspectral imaging capabilities for future line-intensity mapping. Using an observation of Jupiter to calibrate detector gains and pointing offsets, we process the Sgr A observation in a purpose-built pipeline that removes correlated noise through common-mode subtraction with correlation-weighted scaling, and uses map-domain principal component analysis to identify further systematic errors. The resulting frequency-resolved maps recover strong 12CO(2-1) and 13CO(2-1) emission, and a continuum component whose spectral index discriminates free-free emission in the circumnuclear disk (CND) versus thermal dust emission in the 20 km s$^{-1}$ and 50 km s$^{-1}$ molecular clouds. Broadband continuum flux comparisons with the Bolocam Galactic Plane Survey (BGPS) show agreement to within $\sim$5% in high-SNR molecular clouds in the Sgr A region. From the CO line detections, we estimate a molecular hydrogen mass of between $5.4 \times 10^5 M_\odot$ and $5.7 \times 10^5 M_\odot$, consistent with prior studies. These results demonstrate TIME's ability to recover both continuum and spectral-line signals in complex Galactic fields, validating its readiness for upcoming extragalactic CO and [C II] surveys.

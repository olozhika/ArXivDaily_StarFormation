#### Balmer Transition Signatures from Gas-Enshrouded, Dust-Poor Active Galactic Nuclei

 - **Abstract**
 Little red dots (LRDs), a population of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) recently discovered by JWST, show distinctive Balmer-transition features, including prominent Balmer absorption, pronounced Balmer breaks, and large equivalent widths of broad $\mathrm{H}\alpha$ emission, all of which indicate the presence of dense gas surrounding their central black holes. A further key property of LRDs is their large Balmer decrements with broad $\mathrm{H}\alpha/\mathrm{H}\beta$ line-flux ratios far exceeding the Case B recombination value. These ratios of $\mathrm{H}\alpha/\mathrm{H}\beta>3$ have often been interpreted as evidence for heavy dust extinction ($A_V\gtrsim 3$ mag), however such dust would inevitably produce strong near-to-mid infrared re-emission that is hardly seen in JWST/MIRI observations. To investigate the physical origin of these observed Balmer features, we perform radiation transfer calculations through dust-free, dense gas. We show that the observed large Balmer decrements ($\mathrm{H}\alpha/\mathrm{H}\beta$ and $\mathrm{H}\alpha/\mathrm{H}\gamma$) naturally arise from Balmer resonance scattering without invoking dust. At sufficiently high densities ($n_\mathrm{H} \gtrsim 10^{{8}-{10}}~\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$), the elevated multiple Balmer-line ratios converge to values that closely mimic dust reddening, explaining why LRD spectra resemble obscured AGNs. Furthermore, when the Balmer break and broad Balmer lines originate in the same dense gas, their strengths are physically linked, allowing us to constrain the density structure and infer a low broad-line region gas mass of $\sim O(10~M_\odot)$. Such a small gas reservoir would be enriched by even a single supernova, implying that LRDs with observed low-metallicity signatures likely experienced minimal star formation in their nuclei.

 - **Abstract**
 It has been over 24 years since the iconic Crab Nebula has been visited by the high spatial resolution eye of the Hubble Space Telescope. The expanding nebula is dynamic on these timescales, with many of the outer filaments of the nebula known to show proper motions of 0.3'' or more per year. Over time, it has become increasingly difficult to compare the fine scale structure of the nebula with recent data at other wavelengths. We have re-observed the Crab in an HST Cycle 31 program using the WFC3 camera and filters similar to those previously used to make the existing mosaic that dates from 1999-2000 and was obtained with the WFPC2 camera. Two central fields were observed with the F487N filter, providing an uncontaminated hydrogen band for comparison. We also observed two primarily continuum band filters (F547M and F763M), allowing us to study the optical synchrotron nebula component of the Crab's emission. We compare these new data to the first epoch of WFPC2 data as well as to more contemporaneous NIR/MIR imagery from JWST. Finally, we highlight two previously unrecognized groupings of filaments with similar emission characteristics that are nearly diametrically opposed from the pulsar but whose origin remains uncertain.

 - **Abstract**
 Telescope bibliographies record the pulse of astronomy research by capturing publication statistics and citation metrics for telescope facilities. Robust and scalable bibliographies ensure that we can measure the scientific impact of our facilities and archives. However, the growing rate of publications threatens to outpace our ability to manually label astronomical literature. We therefore present the Automated Mission Classifier (amc), a tool that uses large language models (LLMs) to identify and categorize telescope references by processing large quantities of paper text. A modified version of amc performs well on the TRACS Kaggle challenge, achieving a macro $F_1$ score of 0.84 on the held-out test set. amc is valuable for other telescopes beyond TRACS; we developed the initial software for identifying papers that featured scientific results by NASA missions. Additionally, we investigate how amc can also be used to interrogate historical datasets and surface potential label errors. Our work demonstrates that LLM-based applications offer powerful and scalable assistance for library sciences.
#### Synthetic polarization observations of magnetized pillars in HII regions: The limitations of the Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi method

 - **Abstract**
 We investigated the morphology and strength of magnetic fields in pillar-shaped structures at the boundaries of HII regions by combining three-dimensional radiation-magnetohydrodynamic, R-MHD, simulations with synthetic polarimetric observations. Our analysis focuses on the first pillar formed self-consistently in the simulation and is used as a proof of concept to test the applicability of the Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi (DCF) method under conditions dominated by external agents. The pillar arises as the ionization front compresses a dense clump, producing a magnetically aligned, elongated structure whose morphology and field configuration closely resemble those observed in real systems such as the pillars of M16. Synthetic dust-polarization maps at 850 $\mu$m reproduce the large-scale magnetic morphology of the simulated pillar, confirming that polarimetry is a reliable tracer of magnetic field geometry. However, magnetic field strengths inferred using DCF-type methods systematically overestimate intrinsic values from the simulations by factors $\gtrsim 2$. We attribute this discrepancy to the fact that field alignment and amplification are primarily driven by external gas pressure from the expanding HII region rather than internal turbulence, thus violating key assumptions of the DCF method. Our results highlight the need for caution when applying classical DCF-based analysis to pillars or other structures shaped by external compressions.
#### CPI-C: Cool Planet Imaging Coronagraph on Chinese Space Station Survey Telescope

 - **Abstract**
 Cool Planet Imaging Coronagraph (CPI-C) on Chinese Space Station Survey Telescope (CSST) is proposed to direct image the cool planets around nearby solar-type stars (within 40 pc). The core scientific objective of CPI-C is to conduct high-contrast directly imaging surveys of exoplanets ranging in size from Neptune-like to Jupiter-like, located at separations of 0.5 to 5 AU from their host stars, and to perform systematic spectroscopic analysis of the detected planets through high-precision multi-band photometry. CPI-C employs a step-transmission apodization technique to suppress the diffraction noises from the telescope pupil and a precise phase correction technique to eliminate the speckle noises due to imperfections of the optical surfaces. The contrast requirement is better than $10^{-8}$ at an inner working angle (IWA) of $3-4\lambda/D$, in the visible wavelength from 600 nm to 900 nm. CPI-C will be the first space-based instrument capable of directly imaging the reflection light from the cool exoplanets in the visible wavelength enabling the measurement of key physical parameters such as the effective temperature, surface gravity, radius, mass, and other key parameters. The potential observation results will significantly contribute to further understand the formation and evolution mechanisms of planets, which will also lay a solid foundation for future confirmation of the Earth-twins in the next generation space flagship missions.
#### Varying core-envelope coupling efficiency identified from stellar rotation--activity relation

 - **Abstract**
 Core-envelope coupling provides a reasonable explanation of the spin-down stalling of stars in open clusters, which was not predicted by classical gyrochronology. However, it remains an open question whether the coupling efficiency is constant or variable. M dwarfs, possessing thicker convective envelopes and thus longer coupling timescales than other late-type stars, are ideal objects for this investigation. In this letter, we present a new analysis using LAMOST and DESI spectra to construct the rotation--activity ($R_{\rm{HK}}^{'}$--Ro) relation for M dwarfs. The new relation consists of three distinct regimes of fast, intermediate, and slow rotation, closely matching the three sequences of gyrochronology, namely the ``Convective'' sequence, ``Gap'', and ``Interface'' sequence. Our study reveals, for the first time, a variable activity decay rate in the intermediate-rotation regime (i.e., the ``Gap'' region). This implies a varying core-envelope coupling efficiency, peaking towards the end of this region. It also coincides with the well-known stage of stalled stellar spin-down.

 - **Abstract**
 Fallback in core-collapse supernovae plays a central role in setting compact-remnant masses and may produce late-time emission. In hydrogen rich progenitors, the reverse shock arising at the hydrogen-helium interface has the potential to dramatically enhance fallback, yet its overall impact across a broad explosion-energy range has not been systematically quantified. Using one-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations for metal-poor progenitors with $M_{\rm ZAMS}=18$-$28\,M_\odot$ and models with and without hydrogen envelopes, we explore fallback over explosion energies of $10^{48}$-$10^{52}\,{\rm erg}$. We find a robust and universal mass-transition behaviour: when the explosion energy reaches only $2$-$3$ times the binding energy of the hydrogen envelope, the reverse shock returns to the centre and sharply increases the remnant mass by $\gtrsim 2\,M_\odot$. Above this threshold, the reverse shock escapes and hydrogen-rich and stripped-envelope progenitors yield nearly identical remnant masses. By normalizing the results with the envelope binding energy, we show that all progenitor models converge to a common fallback relation. We further provide a simple analytic prescription that connects explosion energy, hydrogen-envelope binding energy, and final compact-remnant mass. This relation provides an important link between progenitor properties and compact-remnant masses, and is useful for population-synthesis and galactic chemical-evolution studies.

 - **Abstract**
 We explore the roles of the three competitors, namely, gravity, turbulence, and magnetic fields, in controlling star formation (SF) within dense, massive clumps identified in the ATLASGAL survey. By examining scaling relations, virial parameters, and turbulent energy spectra, we evaluate the dynamical state of these clumps. We observe a weak velocity dispersion-size relation (sigma proportional to L^0.11), which is much shallower than the classical Larson-like relations, suggesting that turbulence does not mainly drive internal dynamics. The turbulent energy spectrum, E(k) proportional to k^-1.21, is also less steep than what is expected for both incompressible and compressible turbulence. We equally observe a decreasing trend in the virial parameter with increasing mass (alpha_vir proportional to M^-0.37), indicating that more massive clumps are increasingly gravitationally bound. These trends indicate an increasing relative dominance of gravity over turbulence at smaller scales, aligning with multiscale collapse scenarios; however, the absolute energy balance remains unquantifiable with the current data. Although magnetic fields are not directly measured, their potential influence is considered in the interpretation of pressure balance and dynamical support. Our findings imply that gravitational processes appear to primarily regulate the structure and evolution of massive clumps.

 - **Abstract**
 Nickel, one of the most stable elements alongside iron, is the most abundant heavy element beyond iron in cosmic rays. With DAMPE's excellent charge resolution and broad energy range, a high-precision energy spectrum provides valuable insights into the acceleration sources of heavy nuclei and their propagation through the interstellar medium. In this analysis, we report the direct measurement of cosmic-ray nickel spectrum from 10 GeV/n to 2 TeV/n with nine years of flight data. The nickel spectrum is consistent with a single power law with spectral index -2.60 +/- 0.03 from 40 GeV/n to 1 TeV/n. This work provides an accurate measurement of differential flux of nickel with kinetic energy extending to TeV/n for the first time.

 - **Abstract**
 Stripped-envelope supernovae (SESNe), including Type IIb, Ib, and Ic supernovae (SNe), originate from the explosions of massive stars whose outer envelopes have been largely removed during their lifetimes. The main stripping mechanism for the hydrogen (H) envelope in the progenitors of SESNe is often considered to be interaction with a binary companion, while that for the helium (He) layer is unclear. We conducted photometric and spectroscopic observations of the Type Ib SN 2021efd, which shows signs of interaction with H-free circumstellar material (CSM). Around 30 days after the r-band light curve (LC) peak, until at least ~ 770 days, its LCs display excessive luminosity compared to regular SESNe and at least three distinct peaks. The light curve evolution is similar to that of SN 2019tsf, whose previously unpublished spectrum at 400 days is also presented here. The nebular spectrum of SN 2021efd shows narrow emission lines (~ 1000 km/s) in various species. Our observations suggest that SN 2021efd is a Type Ib SN interacting with CSM with the following parameters: The estimated CSM mass, composition, and distribution are at least a few times 0.1 M_sun, H-free, and clumpy, respectively. Based on the estimated ejecta properties, we conclude that this event is a transitional SN whose progenitor was experiencing He-layer stripping at the epoch of the explosion, and was on the way to becoming a carbon-oxygen star from a He star. The estimated CSM properties suggest that the progenitor had some episodic mass ejections with a rate of ~ 0.001-0.01 M_sun/yr for the last decade and slightly smaller before this final phase at least from ~ 200 years before the explosion, for the assumed CSM velocity of 100 km/s. For the case of ~ 1000 km/s, the necessary mass-loss rate would be increased by a factor of ten, and the timescales decreased by a factor of ten.

 - **Abstract**
 The Sun periodically emits intense bursts of radio emission known as solar radio bursts (SRBs). These bursts can disrupt radio communications and be indicative of large solar events that can disrupt technological infrastructure on Earth and in space. The risks posed by these events highlight the need for automated SRB classification, providing the potential to improve event detection and real-time monitoring. This would advance the techniques used to study space weather and related phenomena. A dataset containing images of radio spectra was created using data recorded by the Compound Astronomical Low frequency Low cost Instrument for Spectroscopy and Transportable Observatory (e-Callisto) network. This dataset comprises three categories: empty spectrograms; spectrograms containing Type II SRBs; and spectrograms containing Type III SRBs. These images were used to fine-tune several popular pre-trained deep learning models for classifying Type II and Type III SRBs. The evaluated models included VGGnet-19, MobileNet, ResNet-152, DenseNet-201, and YOLOv8. Testing the models on the test set produced F1 scores ranging from 87\% to 92\%. YOLOv8 emerged as the best-performing model among them, demonstrating that using pre-trained models for event classification can provide an automated solution for SRB classification. This approach provides a practical solution to the limited number of data samples available for Type II SRBs.
#### Laboratory rotational spectroscopy and interstellar search for the protein precursor 4-oxobutanenitrile (HCOCH$_2$CH$_2$CN)

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding the presence and distribution of prebiotic precursors in the interstellar medium (ISM) is key to tracing the chemical origins of life. Among them, 4-oxobutanenitrile (\ch{HCOCH2CH2CN}) has been identified in laboratory simulations as a plausible intermediate in the formation of glutamic acid, a proteinogenic amino acid. Here, we report its gas-phase rotational spectrum, measured using two complementary techniques: chirped-pulse Fourier transform microwave (CP-FTMW) spectroscopy (2$-$18 GHz) and free-jet millimeter-wave (FJ$-$AMMW) absorption spectroscopy (59.6$-$80 GHz). Quantum chemical calculations revealed nine low-energy conformers, of which the TC conformer was assigned based on the measured spectra. The resulting spectroscopic parameters were used to search for the molecule in the ultradeep spectral survey of the G+0.693-0.027 molecular cloud, located in the Galactic Center. No signal attributable to 4$-$oxobutanenitrile was detected. A stringent upper limit to its column density was derived ($N<$ 4 $\times$10$^{12}$ cm$^{-2}$), corresponding to a molecular abundance of $<$ 2.9 $\times$10$^{-11}$ relative to H$_{2}$. This upper limit lies well below the observed abundances of simpler structurally related species containing $-$HCO and $-$CN groups, underscoring the challenge of detecting increasingly complex prebiotic molecules in the ISM and the need for future, more sensitive astronomical facilities.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Comets, asteroids, planetesimals, free-floating planets and brown dwarfs, are continuously injected into the intra-cluster environment after expulsion from their host planetary systems or binary system. The dynamics of large populations of such free-floating comets (ffcs) in a star cluster environment is not yet fully understood. Aims. We investigate the dynamical evolution of comet populations in star clusters, and characterize the kinematics and ejection rates of ffc in a star cluster. Moreover, we determine whether a different initial energy distribution affects the mass segregation of the less massive population. Methods. We carry out simulations using the N-body code NBODY6++GPU-MASSLESS (Flammini Dotti et al. 2025), which allows fast integration of star clusters that contain large numbers of massless particles, to characterize the dynamics of populations of low-mass particles with sub-virial and super-virial distributions. Results. Comets do not participate in the mass segregation process, similarly to planet-size objects, regardless of their initial energy distribution. The latter is slightly changing the whole dynamical evolution at the start of the simulation. We only observe an initial relaxation or collapse of the objects for super-virial and sub-virial ratios, respectively. The external regions of the ffcs population tend to be pulled back in the cluster core at the end of the simulation, suggesting the gravitational pull of the stars is pulling them back in the core. This phenomenon occurs at later times if the system in virial equilibrium. Compared to less massive bodies, brown dwarfs experiences more mass segregation the inner regions tend to be more mixed with the stellar population
#### JWST and HST observations of the host galaxy and supernova, SN 2024aihh in EP240801a at z=1.67

 - **Abstract**
 We present James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations of the counterpart of EP240801a, at z=1.67, the first fast X-ray transient (FXT) identified as an X-ray flash (XRF) by the Einstein Probe (EP) and Fermi-GBM. Our observations reveal strong photometric and spectroscopic evidence for an associated broad-lined Type Ic supernova (SN) SN 2024aihh, the most distant spectroscopically identified gamma ray-burst (GRB)-SN to date. The SN exhibits similar luminosity and light curve evolution to the proto-type GRB-SN 1998bw with an absolute magnitude of the SN at $\sim$23 days rest-frame of $M_{F140W} \approx$-19 mag. The SN is located in a host galaxy with complex morphology at a large ($\sim$6 kpc) offset in a region of relatively low surface brightness. The region around the SN has a modest star formation rate and is dominated by an intermediate mass-weighted age (1.4$\pm$0.3 Gyr) population, despite the apparent presence of a young, massive broad-lined Type Ic SN progenitor. These observations demonstrate that observations with HST and JWST can greatly extend the redshift range over which the GRB/FXT-SN connection can be studied, including in relatively low luminosity, X-ray rich events. They demonstrate little apparent evolution in the SN properties from local examples despite EP240801a originating from an epoch 10 Gyr ago.
#### The multiphase interstellar medium as a common origin for magnetic misalignment and TB parity violation

 - **Abstract**
 We present an original data analysis and a physical model that provide new insights into the origin of, and relationship between, two observables of the dusty, polarized Galaxy at intermediate and high latitudes: (i) the misalignment between HI filamentary structures and magnetic fields and (ii) the positive $TB$ correlation measured in Planck data suggesting parity violation in the interstellar medium (ISM). We confirm an observational link between the two effects and find that both are predominantly produced at large angular scales ($\geq 10^\circ$, multipoles $\ell \leq 20$) with a significantly stronger signal in the northern hemisphere. We propose a model in which filaments and magnetic fields appear misaligned in projection because they are sourced by cold and warm gas phases distributed in different proportions in the Solar neighborhood, from the wall of the Local Bubble to larger distances. These projection effects at large angular scales can produce coherent signatures that propagate to smaller scales in power spectra without invoking local, small-scale filament misalignment. Within this frame, HI filaments remain statistically aligned with the magnetic field in 3D, although with a projected scatter of tens of degrees that requires further investigation. The multiphase, geometrical model presented in this work is supported by Planck polarization data at 30 GHz, where synchrotron radiation dominates, and at 217 and 353 GHz, where dust emission dominates. Our analysis also incorporates starlight polarization measurements. The model introduced here suggests a new interpretation of two unexplained observables and emphasizes the role of the large-scale magnetized ISM in shaping polarized Galactic emission, which has important implications for both Galactic astrophysics and cosmological foreground characterization.

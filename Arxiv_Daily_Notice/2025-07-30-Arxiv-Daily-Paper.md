 - **Abstract**
 The globular cluster Palomar 5 (Pal 5) is in the process of being tidally shredded as it orbits the Milky Way. Its core is currently at a heliocentric distance of ~21 kpc, near apogalacticon (~18 kpc), and it reaches ~5-7 kpc at perigalacticon. Pal 5's leading and trailing arms stretch over 20 degrees on the sky, making them sensitive probes of the Milky Way's mass distribution. In this work, we search for red giant members of Pal 5 using spectroscopic data from APOGEE DR17 and photometric and astrometric data from Gaia DR3. Based on position and proper motion, we identify eight members of Pal 5: six in the core and two in the stream. The clustering algorithm HDBSCAN finds these same eight. We then use chemical tagging with APOGEE abundances to search for additional members across five APOGEE fields overlapping Pal 5. While several dozen candidates are identified, most deviate (some significantly) from known kinematic and color-magnitude trends, suggesting that they are less likely to be true members. We estimate the expected number of giants in the APOGEE pointings based on the area and stellar mass of the streams. Given APOGEE's limiting magnitude, we find that few, if any, new giants are expected, especially if the stream is more diffuse at these locations. Our results support the presence of density variations in Pal 5's tidal streams, consistent with earlier studies attributing such features to baryonic perturbers in the Milky Way, dark matter subhaloes, or interactions with passing globular clusters.

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar activity variability is one of the main obstacles to the detection of Earth-like planets using the RV method. The aim of this work is to measure the effect of activity in the spectra of M dwarfs and detect activity-sensitive lines in the NIR. We took advantage of the simultaneous observations of HARPS and the newly commissioned NIRPS spectrograph to carry out a blind search of the most activity-sensitive spectral lines in the NIR using NIRPS spectra and known activity indicators in the optical from HARPS as a reference. We analysed the spectra of Proxima (M5.5V) and Gl 581 (M3V), two M dwarfs with different activity levels and internal structures. Spectral lines were identified for both stars and their profiles were fitted using different models. We found hundreds of lines sensitive to activity for both stars; the Proxima spectra were more affected. For Proxima, 32% of the identified lines can be used to measure the rotation period of the star, while for Gl 581 the numbers drops to 1%. The fraction of lines sensitive to activity increases with increasing line depth. A list of 17 lines with rotation period detection for both stars is provided. Stellar activity is able to affect a significant number of spectral lines in the NIR, and methods should be developed to mitigate those effects at the spectral level. The line distortions detected here are expected to come mainly from the flux effect due to temperature contrasts between active regions and the quiet photosphere; however, we cannot rule out the possibility that core-emission from chromospheric activity or Zeeman splitting are also affecting some lines. The new line lists presented here can be used to improve the RV extraction and the detection of RV variability due to stellar activity signals, and to help false positive detection and the modelling of activity variability, thereby enhancing exoplanet detection in the NIR.

 - **Abstract**
 Planned and ongoing campaigns for the acquisition of high-quality local measurements of the Galactic magnetic field (GMF) at interstellar cloud locations have generated intense interest in the use of such measurements to accurately backtrack Ultra High-Energy Cosmic Rays (UHECR) through the Milky Way, a crucial aspect of charged-particle astronomy. However, the inherent sparsity of these measurements raises concerns regarding the feasibility of this approach. We assessed the achievable accuracy of UHECR backtracking using mock sparse local GMF data derived from the Jansson & Farrar 2012 (JF12) GMF model and mock UHECR events. We created mock UHECR datasets that trace back within a 3 degree angular range from the galaxy M82 (a hypothesized UHECR source), and we investigated the impact on such backtracking attempts of varying GMF measurement sparsity and of varying GMF strength, which we emulated by rescaling the strength of the ordered components of the JF12 model. We found that: (a) for an average GMF strength of $1\mu G$, satisfactory backtracking results for magnetic rigidities of $10^{20}$ eV can be obtained even with very sparse measurements ($ \sim 1600$ pc); (b) when the average GMF strength is significantly increased ($\sim$ factor of 10) the accuracy of backtracking breaks down at measurement spacings of 400 pc. These findings emphasize on one hand that sparsity is not an automatic deal-breaker for the utility of local GMF measurements in UHECR backtracking. On the other hand, we also confirm that important challenges remain on the path from sparse local GMF measurements to precise charge-particle astronomy, especially in directions of high-strength ordered magnetic fields. This underscores the importance of using all available complementary magnetic field measurements and sophisticated reconstruction techniques to enable accurate backtracking of UHECR.
#### Rotational Dynamics in Pulsational Pair-Instability Supernovae: Implications for Mass-Loss and Transient Events

 - **Abstract**
 Pulsational pair-instability supernovae (PPISNe) are transient events occurring in progenitor stars with helium cores of approximately 32-65 solar masses, where rapid electron-positron pair production induces pressure loss, collapse, and pulsations driving episodic mass loss. The number, strength, and duration of these pulses can lead to shell collisions that produce shock-powered transients, potentially explaining some of the most luminous events, such as superluminous supernovae, and other rare transients. Rapid progenitor rotation lowers the PPISN mass threshold and influences the dynamics, energetics, and chemical composition of PPISN-driven pulses. In this study, we computed 1D evolutionary models of massive, rotating PPISN progenitor stars with zero-age main-sequence masses of 85-140 solar masses and solar metallicity and 10% solar metallicity. Our analysis reveals strong correlations between PPISN ejected mass and total energy as well as between ejected mass and peak ejected shell velocity. Additionally, moderate correlations indicate that higher initial PPISN progenitor mass leads to greater mass ejection and energy release, while negative correlations show that rapid rotation appears to reduce mass ejection and kinetic energy of the shells. Subsequent pulses lead to hydrogen-poor, carbon- and oxygen-enriched ejected shells, indicating the effect of rotationally-induced chemical mixing in PPISN-driven episodic mass loss with implications for their transients. We model the light curve and synthetic spectra that arise from the collision of two H-poor shells for one of our models using the radiation transport code SuperLite. We find that shock-heated H-poor PPISN shell collisions from rapidly rotating progenitors can lead to moderately luminous H-poor transients that share some similarities with observed SLSN-I events.
#### Preferential alignments of exoplanetary orbital planes in Milky Way spiral arms

 - **Abstract**
 Special orientations of the orbital planes may be reminiscent of the specific conditions that triggered and drove the star formation processes and how these are related to local and global Galactic kinematics. For a special sample of 66 extrasolar planets discovered with the microlensing method it is possible to determine the position angle of the planets in the sky relative to their hosts. We test the hypothesis that such orientations are randomly distributed against the possibility that the orbital planes follow some preferential alignment. We find that planets in the Scutum-Centaurus arm show a significant alignment with the Galactic plane, with an isotropic distribution disfavored by a factor of 10. Bulge planets and disk planets outside this major arm are instead compatible with isotropic distributions or show weak alternative preferences at most. Using the method proposed here, the future Roman microlensing survey will be able to identify and quantify preferential orientations in all structures from the Sun to the bulge with high confidence and accuracy.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the discovery of activity emanating from (18916) 2000 OG44 (alternately designated 1977 SD), a minor planet previously reported to be both an extinct comet or an asteroid on a cometary orbit. We observed 2000 OG44 with a thin tail oriented towards the coincident anti-solar and anti-motion vectors (as projected on the sky) in images we acquired on UT 2023 July 24 and 26 with the Apache Point Observatory 3.5-meter Astrophysical Research Consortium telescope (New Mexico, USA). We also include observations made in Arizona with the Vatican Advanced Technology Telescope at the Mount Graham International Observatory and the Lowell Observatory Lowell Discovery Telescope near Happy Jack. We performed dynamical simulations that reveal 2000 OG44 most likely originated in the Oort cloud, arriving within the last 4 Myr. We find 2000 OG44, which crosses the orbits of both Jupiter and Mars, is at present on an orbit consistent with a Jupiter-family comet (JFC). We carried out thermodynamical modeling that informed our broader diagnosis that the observed activity is most likely due to volatile sublimation.
#### A North-South Metallicity Asymmetry in the Outer Galactic disk -- Evidence for the Pericentric Passage of the Sagittarius Dwarf Galaxy

 - **Abstract**
 We present maps of the mean metallicity distributions on the Galactocentric $R$--$Z$ plane at different azimuthal angles using red clump stars selected from the LAMOST and APOGEE surveys. In the inner disk ($R < $ 11\,kpc), the metallicity distribution is symmetric between the upper and lower disk. However, we find a North-South metallicity asymmetry in the outer disk ($R > 11$\,kpc), especially towards the anti-Galactic center ($-5^\circ < \Phi < 15^\circ$) direction. By further dissecting the map in age space, we detect this asymmetry across all mono-age stellar populations. However, the asymmetry is less pronounced in older populations ($\tau > 8$ Gyr) compared to younger ones ($\tau < 6$\,Gyr). This reduced significance likely stems from three factors: larger age uncertainties, fewer stars in the outer disk, and the kinematically hotter nature of older populations. The observed metallicity asymmetry may be the consequence of the purturbation of the recent pericentric passage through the Galactic disk and tidal force of the well-known Sagittarius dwarf galaxy.

 - **Abstract**
 The Quintuplet cluster, located in the Galactic centre, is one of the few young massive clusters in the Milky Way. It allows us to study dozens of massive, post main sequence stars individually, providing unique insights into the properties of the most massive stars. Our goal is to study the radio continuum emission of the most massive stars in the cluster. We carried out a total of nine observations (three in the C- and six in the X-band) of the Quintuplet cluster with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array in A-configuration. We cross-matched the detected sources with infrared stellar catalogues to ensure cluster membership, calculated their spectral indices, quantified variability, and inferred clumping-scaled mass-loss rates We present the most complete catalogue of radio stars in the Quintuplet cluster to date, with a total of 41 detections, and the deepest images of the cluster in the 4 to 12 GHz range (reaching an rms noise level of $2.3\, \mu\mathrm{Jy/beam}$ in the X-band). The six year baseline of our observations allowed us to perform a robust variability assessment, finding that around $60\%$ of the Quintuplet radio-stars are variable on timescales of months to years. We derived the spectral indices of 28 out of the 41 sources. Based on their spectral indices and variability, we classify 11 of them as colliding-wind binaries, seven as strictly thermal sources, and ten as ambiguous. Including the ambiguous sources, we estimate a multiplicity fraction of ($75\pm22\%$). We also computed upper limits for the mass-loss rates of the thermal radio-stars, finding them in agreement with typical values for WNh and WC stars. Finally, we compare these results to the ones obtained from our analogous study of the Arches cluster.

 - **Abstract**
 Colliding wind binaries (CWBs) are promising sources of high-energy gamma-ray emission driven by shock acceleration of particles at wind interaction zones. The nearby CWB system $\gamma^2$ Velorum (WR 11), composed of a Wolf-Rayet (WR) and an O-star, has been recently associated with GeV gamma-ray emission observed by Fermi-LAT, including evidence of orbital variability. This offers a valuable opportunity to test models of phase-dependent hadronic emission and absorption in CWBs. We aim to explain both the spectral energy distribution (SED) and orbital variability of gamma-ray emission from $\gamma^2$ Velorum using a physically motivated phase-dependent hadronic model. We consider the injection of accelerated relativistic protons based on the WR wind's kinetic energy intercepted at the wind collision region (WCR), and calculate the resulting phase-dependent hadronic gamma-ray emission assuming a proton conversion efficiency $\eta_p$ and accounting for energy-dependent diffusion, advection, conical shock interception and the evolution of the effective acceleration volume, assumed to scale with the WCR, with the orbital phase. Gamma-ray emission from hadronic interactions is attenuated by $\gamma$ - $\gamma$ absorption, calculated via full angular integration over both stellar photon fields. Our model successfully reproduces the observed SED and is consistent with the apastron-to-periastron flux ratio, resulting in a dip in emission at periastron passage and an increase during apastron. Our findings support the conclusion that the observed orbital modulation is primarily driven by geometric variations of the WCR. This underscores the significant influence of evolving orbital geometry on the high-energy gamma-ray light curves of $\gamma^2$ Velorum.
#### Nighttime Cloud Detection, Tracking and Prediction with All-Sky Cameras

 - **Abstract**
 This paper presents a novel method for real-time nighttime cloud detection, tracking, and prediction using all-sky cameras, aimed at enhancing the efficiency of ground-based robotic telescopes. Ground-based telescopes are vulnerable to adverse weather conditions, particularly cloud cover, which can lead to the loss of valuable observation time and potential damage to the telescope. Existing methods for cloud detection have limitations in accuracy, particularly under varying illumination conditions such as gibbous moon phases. To address these challenges, we developed an algorithm that uses the temporal incoherence of image sequences from all-sky cameras. The method computes difference images to highlight moving cloud structures, applies Otsu thresholding to generate binary cloud maps, and uses mathematical morphology techniques to reduce noise from bright stars and other artifacts. Segmented cloud regions are then tracked across successive frames, allowing estimation of a velocity vector and enabling short-term predictions of cloud movement. Our approach achieves reliable cloud detection and tracking, providing predictions up to 15 minutes into the future - a capability critical for robotic telescopes that rely on look-ahead scheduling. The system was validated against extensive historical data from the Liverpool Telescope's Skycam A and T systems, achieving a false positive rate of approximately 1% and a similar false negative rate, depending on cloud thickness and speed. By improving cloud forecasting and observational scheduling, the system offers a valuable tool for enhancing the operational reliability of robotic telescopes.

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs) can strip planetary atmospheres, reducing the potential habitability of terrestrial planets. While flares have been observed for decades, stellar CMEs remain elusive. Extreme ultraviolet (EUV) emissions are sensitive to both flares and CME-induced coronal dimming. We assess the detectability of stellar CME-induced EUV dimming events by adapting a known "Sun-as-a-star" dimming technique -- validated by the Solar Dynamics Observatory's EUV Variability Experiment (EVE) -- to stellar conditions. We adapt the solar data to reflect a range of stellar intensities, accounting for intrinsic brightness, distance, and interstellar medium (ISM) attenuation. We generate synthetic light curves for two different missions: the legacy EUV Explorer (EUVE) and the proposed ESCAPE mission. Our results indicate that dimming detections are well within reach. EUVE's broadband imager was capable of detecting stellar CMEs -- albeit with limited spectral (temperature) resolution -- but that was not part of the observing plan. EUVE's spectroscopic survey lacked sufficient sensitivity for CME detections. Optimizing modern instrument design for this task would make the observation fully feasible. In this work, we present a tool to explore the stellar-CME detection parameter space. Our tool shows that an instrument with performance similar to ESCAPE, setting a 600-second integration period, and integrating the spectra into bands, any star with an X-ray flux $\geq 2.51 \times 10^{-12}$ergs$^{-1}$~cm$^{-2}$ should have a $\geq 3\sigma$ detection even for a modest few-percent dimming profile, regardless of ISM attenuation. Such measurements would be crucial for understanding the space weather environments of exoplanet host stars and, ultimately, for evaluating planetary habitability.
#### JCMT POL-2 observations of magnetic fields potentially shaped by outflows in the pre-planetary nebulae CRL 618 and OH231.8+4.2

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first observations of magnetic fields in pre-planetary nebulae (PPNe) made with the POL-2 polarimeter on the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT). We observed the PPNe CRL 618 and OH231.8+4.2 in 850 $\mu$m polarized light. In both cases, we observe ordered magnetic fields that appear to arise from dusty circumstellar material that has been swept up by the passage of outflows driven by the central post-Asymptotic Giant Branch (post-AGB) star. CRL 618 shows a magnetic field aligned with one of the most extreme position angles of the outflowing bullets ejected from the central source. We hypothesize that polarized emission in CRL 618 may preferentially arise from material in the walls of the dust cavity opened by the ejected bullets. Conversely, OH231.8+4.2 shows a magnetic field that is aligned approximately perpendicular to the outflow direction, which may preferentially arise from an infrared-bright dense clump embedded near the base of the outflow. Despite CRL 618 being carbon-rich and OH231.8+4.2 being oxygen-rich, there is no significant difference in the polarization fractions of the two sources. This suggests that at linear resolutions $\sim 10^{4}$ au, the complexity of the magnetic field geometry on scales smaller than the beam, rather than grain composition, sets the measured polarization fraction of these sources.

 - **Abstract**
 Turbulence and magnetic fields are components of the interstellar medium and are interconnected through plasma processes. In particular, the magnetic flux transport in the presence of magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence is an essential factor for understanding star formation. The theory of Reconnection Diffusion (RD), based on statistics of Alfvénic turbulence, predicts a dependence of the diffusion coefficient of the magnetic field on the Alfvénic Mach number $M_A$. However, this theory does not consider the effects of compressibility which are important in the regime of supersonic MHD turbulence. In this work, we measure the diffusion coefficient of magnetic fields in sub-Alfvénic MHD turbulence, with different sonic Mach numbers $M_S$. We perform numerical simulations of forced turbulence in periodic domains from the incompressible limit to the supersonic regime. We introduce two methods to extract the diffusion coefficient, based on the analysis of tracer particles. Our results confirm the RD assumption regarding the correspondence between the diffusion of magnetic field and that of fluid Lagrangian particles. The measured diffusion rate provided by incompressible turbulence agrees with the suppression predicted by the RD theory in the presence of strong magnetic fields: $D \propto M_A^3$. Our simulations also indicate an increase in RD efficiency when the turbulence is compressible. The dependency on $M_A$ and $M_S$ from the simulations can be described by the relation $D \propto M_A^\alpha$, where $\alpha(M_S) \approx 3/(1 + M_S)$. This quantitative characterization of $D$ is critical for modeling star formation in turbulent molecular clouds and evaluating the efficiency of this transport compared to other mechanisms.

 - **Abstract**
 High center-of-mass electromagnetic~(EM) interactions could produce decaying heavy leptons and hadrons, leading to neutrino generation. These processes might occur in the most extreme astrophysical scenarios, potentially altering the expected gamma-ray and neutrino fluxes in both the hadronic and the leptonic pictures. For instance, neutrinos could arise from high-redshift EM cascades, triggered by gamma rays beyond $10^{18} \; \text{eV}$ scattering background photons, from radio to ultraviolet energy bands. Such energetic gamma rays are predicted in cosmogenic models and in scenarios involving non-standard physics. On astrophysical scales, leptonic production of neutrinos could take place in active galactic nuclei cores, where several-TeV gamma rays interact with the X-ray photons from the hot corona. We explore these scenarios within the CRPropa Monte Carlo code framework, developing dedicated tools to account for leptonic production and decay of heavy leptons and hadrons. In particular, the latter are performed by interfacing with the PYTHIA event generator. With these novel tools, we characterise the spectrum and flavour composition of neutrinos emerging from cosmological EM cascades and from leptonic processes in the core of active galactic nuclei. Finally, we investigate the leptonic production of neutrinos in the context of the IceCube detection of NGC~1068.

 - **Abstract**
 We have reprocessed the data archived from the Parkes 70-cm pulsar (PKS70) survey with an expanded DM search range and an acceleration search. Our goal was to detect pulsars that might have been missed in the original survey processing. Of the original 43842 pointings, 34869 pointings were archived, along with 440 additional pointings for confirmation or timing. We processed all of these archived data and detected 359 known pulsars: 265 of these were detected in the original survey, while an additional 94 currently known pulsars were detected in our reprocessing. A few among those 94 pulsars are highly accelerated binary pulsars. Furthermore, we detected 5 more pulsars with DMs higher than the original survey thresholds, as well as 6 more pulsars below the nominal survey sensitivity threshold (from the original survey beams with longer integrations). We missed detection of 33 (of the 298) pulsars detected in the original survey, in part because portions of the survey data were missing in the archive and our early stage candidate sifting method. We discovered one new pulsar in the re-analysis, PSR J0540$-$69 which has a spin period of 0.909 s and resides in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). This new pulsar appeared in three PKS70 beams and one additional L-band observation that targeted the LMC pulsar PSR B0540$-$69. The numerous pulsar detections found in our re-analysis and the discovery of a new pulsar in the LMC highlight the value of conducting multiple searches through pulsar datasets.

 - **Abstract**
 Star-forming regions are essential for studying very young stellar objects of various masses. They still contain a significant amount of dust and gas. We present a study of light curves of stars in the field of the Chamaeleon I association. We use automatic spectral classification with MKCLASS to identify the spectral types of the stars in the field with a light curve from the NEOWISE and Gaia surveys. The light curves are analysed using the software Peranso and astropy. We also used VSX to identify the variability type. Based on astrometry, we have identified 92 stars, 73 of which are members of the association. We received light curves for 55 stars from the Gaia survey and for 69 stars from the ALLWISE/NEOWISE survey. For 28 of them, it was possible to determine the types of variables, mostly T Tauri and Orion variables. The spectral types of the members are mostly cooler M-type stars, with one being a possible chemically peculiar (CP) star. The non-members associated with light curve measurements include spectral types A-G with one CP candidate.

 - **Abstract**
 Strange quark stars (SQSs), namely compact stars entirely composed of deconfined quark matter, are characterized by similar masses and compactness to neutron stars (NSs) and have been theoretically proposed to exist in the Universe since the 1970s. However, multiwavelength observations of compact stars in the last 50 years have not yet led to an unambiguous SQS identification. This article explores whether SQSs could form in the supernova (SN) explosion of an evolved star (e.g., carbon-oxygen, or Wolf-Rayet) occurring in a binary with the companion being a neutron star (NS). The collapse of the iron core of the evolved star generates a newborn NS and the SN explosion. Part of the ejected matter accretes onto the NS companion as well as onto the newborn NS via matter fallback. The accretion occurs at hypercritical (highly super-Eddington) rates, transferring mass and angular momentum to the stars. We present numerical simulations of this scenario and demonstrate that the density increase in the NS interiors during the accretion process may induce quark matter deconfinement, suggesting the possibility of SQS formation. We discuss the astrophysical conditions under which such a transformation may occur and possible consequences.

 - **Abstract**
 The hydrogenation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) is crucial to understanding molecular hydrogenation formation in the interstellar medium. This process also helps to elucidate the weakening of the aromatic bonds in PAHs, which may function as a carbon reservoir. Tunneling can significantly promote the hydrogenation process in a low to moderate temperature range. We present the hydrogenation sequence of the newly observed PAH molecule, indene, and clarify the tunneling rule at temperature in photodissociation region (PDR) and dark molecular cloud conditions. In addition, we report fit parameters to be utilized in astronomical modeling. The hydrogenation sequence was studied using simple hydrogenation rules and confirmed by barriers from density functional theory (DFT). To make our kinetic studies useful to modelers, we implemented a Monte Carlo method based program to generate and optimize random initial fit parameters (alpha, beta, gamma, and T0) to achieve the statistically best fit. We find that indene hydrogenation follows rules similar to those of other PAHs, such as pentacene, coronene, and corannulene, with binding energies for odd numbered hydrogenation steps ranging from 0.5 to 2 eV and barriers around 0.13 eV for the first, fifth, and seventh hydrogenation steps. The third hydrogenation step is the rate limiting step, similar to what is found for other PAHs. Even numbered hydrogenation steps have lower barriers and lead to more stable intermediates as a result of radical recombinations. The hydrogenation sequence follows a scheme that strongly depends on the PAH's shape, the number of aromatic rings, and the presence of five membered rings. Furthermore, we observe that tunneling plays an important role in the hydrogenation of indene at temperatures between 30 and 75 K, which corresponds to the temperatures of dust in PDRs.
#### The Cooling of Old White Dwarfs in 47 Tucanae

 - **Abstract**
 We analysed the cooling of white dwarfs in the globular cluster 47 Tucanae using deep observations from the Hubble Space Telescope that resolve the white dwarf cooling sequence to late enough cooling times that the white dwarf core has begun to crystallise and the envelope has become convectively coupled to the core. At such late cooling times, both the state of matter assumed for ions in the treatment of element diffusion and the thickness of the outer H envelope become important considerations for modelling white dwarf cooling. Using the stellar evolution software Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA), we created a suite of white dwarf cooling models for different treatments of element diffusion, as well as different values of the white dwarf mass and H envelope thickness parameters. Three different diffusion scenarios were considered: i) the standard MESA implementation, which implicitly uses an ideal gas approximation for the ions, ii) a custom modified implementation that accounts for non-ideal gas effects, and iii) no diffusion. An unbinned likelihood analysis was performed to compare these cooling models to the observations. This work both constrains the values of parameters important for modelling white dwarf cooling and tests the implementation of element diffusion in MESA to late cooling times. We find that models with thicker H envelopes are preferred and that the standard MESA diffusion treatment produces a best-fitting model that well reproduces the cumulative white dwarf luminosity functions of the observations.

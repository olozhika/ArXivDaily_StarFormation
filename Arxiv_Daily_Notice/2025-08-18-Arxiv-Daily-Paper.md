 - **Abstract**
 Using cosmological radiation-hydrodynamical simulations, we study the effect of accreting supermassive black holes (SMBHs) on nearby dark-matter (DM) haloes in the very early universe. We find that an SMBH with a spectral energy distribution (SED) extending from the near-ultraviolet to hard X-rays, can produce a radiation background sufficient to delay gravitational collapse in surrounding DM haloes until up to $10^7$ M$_\odot$ of zero-metallicity gas is available for the formation of Population III (Pop III) stars or direct-collapse black holes (DCBHs). We model three scenarios, corresponding to an SMBH located at physical distances of 10, 100, and 1000 kpc from the Pop III host DM halo. Using these three scenarios, we use the SED to compute self-consistent photoionization, photoheating, and photodissociation rates. We include the effects of Compton scattering and gas self-shielding. The X-ray portion of the spectrum maintains an elevated free-electron fraction as the gas collapses to high density. This stimulates H2 formation, allowing the gas to cool further while counteracting the dissociation of H2 by Lyman-Werner radiation. As a result, a large cluster of Pop III stars is expected to form, except in the case with the most intense radiation in which a DCBH may instead form. Our simulated Pop III clusters have comparable HeII 1640 luminosities to the recently discovered Pop III host candidate near GN-z11, observed by the James Webb Space Telescope. In two of the scenarios we consider, the resulting clusters could be detectable using the telescope's NIRSpec instrument out to z ~ 15.

 - **Abstract**
 How does molecular cloud chemistry change with metallicity? In this work, we study the relation between molecular hydrogen ($H_2$) and carbon monoxide (CO) at $1/2$ and $1/5$ solar metallicity using ultraviolet absorption spectroscopy obtained as part of the UV Legacy Library of Young Stars as Essential Standards (ULLYSES) Hubble Space Telescope (HST) program. We determine CO column densities or upper limits for a sample of 50 lines of sight through the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds (LMC and SMC). $^{12}$CO is detected along eight lines of sight and $^{13}$CO is detected along two. Combining our new CO column densities with $N_{H_2}$ measurements from the literature, we find that the evolution of $N_{CO}(N_{H_2})$ from the Milky Way to the LMC and SMC is a relatively shallow function of metallicity. Taking $N_{CO}>3\times10^{15}$ cm$^{-2}$ as a threshold value above which CO emission is likely to be detectable at the distance of the Magellanic Clouds, the $\log_{10} N_{H_2}$ at which a sightline has a 50% probability of having $N_{CO}$ above this threshold is 20.8 in the Milky Way, 20.9 in the LMC, and 21.1 in the SMC. This is an 0.3 dex change in threshold $\log_{10} N_{H_2}$ over an 0.7 dex change in metallicity. We compare our measurements with $N_{CO}(N_{H_2})$ relations from literature chemical models and find that the measured relations agree best with models in which the dynamical timescale is longer than the chemical timescale for $H_2$ but shorter than the chemical timescale for CO.
#### $r$-process Abundance Dispersion in the Globular Cluster M5 using Keck Archival Data

 - **Abstract**
 We studied $28$ RGB stars in the mildly metal-rich globular cluster M5 ([Fe/H] $= -1.29$) using archival high-resolution spectra from the Keck Observatory archive (KOA) to better understand the $r$-process in globular clusters. Previous studies (M15, M92, and NGC 2298) have shown $r$-process dispersion in varying amounts, hinting at the source of the $r$-process in those clusters. We extend these dispersion studies to the more metal-rich cluster M5 by studying the rare-earth peak, specifically the elements Ba, Nd, and Eu. We separately analyze the different stellar generations, as traced by the abundance of Na and O. Based on the Nd and Eu abundances, we report a tenuous detection of $r$-process dispersion that is dependent on the generation and element. Based on a log-likelihood dispersion study accounting for measurement errors, Nd has an intrinsic first generation abundance spread of $\sigma_{1G}(\text{Nd}) = 0.15_{-0.07}^{+0.10}$ and an $2\sigma$ upper limit on the second generation spread of $\sigma_{2G}(\text{Nd}) < 0.28$. The upper limits on the Eu intrinsic spread are $\sigma_{1G}(\text{Eu}) < 0.34$ and $\sigma_{2G}(\text{Eu}) < 0.16$. A potential dispersion implies the cluster gas was inhomogeneously polluted, either due to an event concurrent with the formation of the cluster or due to clouds of disparate composition that coalesced to form the cluster.
#### Explosions of pulsating red supergiants: a natural pathway for the diversity of Type II-P/L supernovae

 - **Abstract**
 Red supergiants (RSGs), which are progenitors of hydrogen-rich Type II supernovae (SNe), have been known to pulsate from both observations and theory. The pulsations can be present at core collapse and affect the resulting SN. However, SN light curve models of such RSGs commonly use hydrostatic progenitor models and ignore pulsations. Here, we model the final stages of a 15 solar-mass RSG and self-consistently follow the hydrodynamical evolution. We find the growth of large amplitude radial pulsations in the envelope. After a transient phase where the envelope restructures, the pulsations settle to a steady and periodic oscillation with a period of 817 days. We show that they are driven by the $\kappa\gamma$-mechanism, which is an interplay between changing opacities and the release of recombination energy of hydrogen and helium. This leads to complex and non-coherent expansion and contraction in different parts of the envelope, which greatly affect the SN progenitor properties, including its location in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. We simulate SN explosions of this model at different pulsations phases. Explosions in the compressed state result in a flat light curve (Type II-P). In contrast, the SN light curve in the expanded state declines rapidly, reminiscent of a Type II-L SN. For cases in between, we find light curves with various decline rates. Features in the SN light curves are directly connected to features in the density profiles. These are in turn linked to the envelope ionization structure, which is the driving mechanism of the pulsations. We predict that some of the observed diversity in Type II SN light curves can be explained by RSG pulsations. For more massive RSGs, we expect stronger pulsations that might even lead to dynamical mass ejections of the envelope and to an increased diversity in SN light curves.

 - **Abstract**
 It is known that massive red supergiants (RSGs) become hydrodynamically unstable and experience radial pulsations before they explode. Still, the vast majority of supernova (SN) models assume RSG progenitors in hydrostatic equilibrium. Here, we self-consistently follow the hydrodynamic evolution of RSGs with different masses and the development of radial envelope pulsations. Pulsations significantly alter the observable pre- and post-SN properties, and their importance increases substantially as a function of initial mass. We demonstrate that it is not advisable to infer core masses, let alone initial masses, from a single pre-SN luminosity and effective temperature of high-mass RSGs, as these quantities can vary by an order of magnitude during the pulsation. For all masses considered, we find that pulsations can naturally lead to "early-excess" emission in SN light-curves and to variations in the early photospheric velocity evolution compared to hydrostatic models that can help break the degeneracies in type-II SNe. We compare to SN 2023ixf, for which a pulsating RSG progenitor was discovered. We demonstrate that its pre- and post-SN characteristics agree very well with our exploding pulsating RSG model, while hydrostatic stellar models are not well-suited. The data coverage at early times is insufficient to break all the degeneracies in the progenitor and SN parameters, but we find some constraints on the explosion phase. We show that there is no evidence for the claimed pulsation period of the SN 2024ggi progenitor, as it is consistent with the orbital period of Spitzer. This study emphasizes the importance of hydrodynamical pre-SN stellar models for studying SNe and implies an important shift in our understanding of the last stages of massive star evolution, the interpretation of pre-SN properties, the connection between SNe and their progenitors, and the missing RSG problem.
#### SQ-A: A Collision Triggered Starburst in Intra-Group Medium of Stephan's Quintet

 - **Abstract**
 We present new observational evidence supporting the hypothesis that SQ-A, a starburst in the intra-group medium (IGrM) of Stephan's Quintet (SQ), is triggered by a high-speed collision between two gas systems, one associated with the IGrM (v~6900 km/s) and another with the intruder galaxy NGC7318b (v~6000 km/s). The new ALMA CO(2-1) dataset has angular resolutions between 0.2" and 7.0" and the new VLA HI datacube an angular resolution of 6.6" * 7.9". The CO maps show that the two gas systems are bridged by another system with an intermediate velocity of ~6600 km/s, whereas the HI data show that the component of v~6600 km/s fits well into a gap in the more extended v~6000 km/s component, albeit with a displacement of ~5 kpc. Both the bridge and the complementary distributions between different gas systems are common features of starbursts triggered by cloud-cloud collision. An analysis of clumps (sizes of 100--200 pc) reveals very diversified star formation (SF) activity in clumps belonging to different kinematic systems, with the molecular gas depletion time of the v~6900 km/s clumps more than 10 times longer than that of the v~6600 km/s clumps. The results are consistent with a scenario in which the enhanced SF activity (and the starburst) in the system of v~6600 km/s is due to gas compression generated in cloud-cloud collisions, whereas the suppression of SF in the v~6900 km/s system is due to vortices (i.e. gas rotation) generated in more complex collisions involving dense clouds and diffuse intercloud gas accompanied by blast-wave shocks.
#### Discovery of H$α$ Emission from a Protoplanet Candidate Around the Young Star 2MASS J16120668-3010270 with MagAO-X

 - **Abstract**
 2MASS J16120668-3010270 (hereafter 2MJ1612) is a young M0 star that hosts a protoplanetary disk in the Upper Scorpious star-forming region. Recent ALMA observations of 2MJ1612 show a mildly inclined disk ($i$=37$^\circ$) with a large dust-depleted gap (R$_\text{cav}\approx$0.4" or 53 au). We present high-contrast H$\alpha$ observations from MagAO-X on the 6.5m Magellan Telescope and new high resolution sub-mm dust continuum observations with ALMA of 2MJ1612. On both 2025 April 13 and 16, we recovered a point source with H$\alpha$ excess with SNR $\gtrsim$5 within the disk gap in our MagAO-X Angular and Spectral Differential (ASDI) images at a separation of 141.96$\pm$2.10 mas (23.45$\pm$0.29 au deprojected) from the star and position angle (PA)= 159.00$\pm$0.55$^\circ$. Furthermore, this H$\alpha$ source is within close proximity to a K band point source in SPHERE/IRDIS observation taken on 2023 July 21 \citep{sphere2025sub}. The astrometric offset between the K band and H$\alpha$ source can be explained by orbital motion of a bound companion. Thus our observations can be best explained by the discovery of an accreting protoplanet, 2MJ1612 b, with an estimated mass of 4$M_\text{Jup}$ and H$\alpha$ line flux ranging from (29.7 $\pm$7.5)$\times$10$^{-16}$ ergs/s/cm$^2$ to (8.2$\pm$3.4)$\times$10$^{-16}$ ergs/s/cm$^2$. 2MJ1612 b is likely the third example of an accreting H$\alpha$ protoplanet responsible for carving the gap in its host disk, joining PDS 70b and c. Further study is necessary to confirm and characterize this protoplanet candidate and to identify any additional protoplanets that may also play a role in shaping the gap.

 - **Abstract**
 Aims: To investigate the physical processing of PAHs in high-mass star-forming environments. This study aims to characterize how the PAH ionization fraction varies across different H II regions and to search for spectroscopic evidence of the processing or destruction of PAH molecules in intense radiation fields. Methodology: We utilized mid-infrared integral field spectroscopic data from the JWST's Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) in its Medium Resolution Spectroscopy (MRS) mode. One-dimensional spectra were extracted for each of the four H II regions. We measured the integrated fluxes of the prominent PAH emission features at 7.7, 8.6, and 11.3 micron and calculated key diagnostic flux ratios to probe the physical state of the PAH population. Results: The four H II regions in NGC 5457 exhibit significant diversity in their PAH spectral characteristics. The diagnostic F(8.6)/F(11.3) ratio, a tracer of PAH ionization, varies from 0.23 to 0.62 across the sample. The region with the highest ionization (highest F(8.6)/F(11.3)) shows the lowest F(7.7)/F(8.6) ratio (1.13), while the region with the lowest ionization has the highest F(7.7)/F(8.6) ratio (2.38). Conclusion: The observed spectral diversity is primarily driven by variations in the PAH ionization state, which is governed by the local radiation field intensity. The strong anti-correlation between the F(7.7)/F(8.6) and F(8.6)/F(11.3) ratios provides a new, powerful diagnostic for PAH processing. This trend is interpreted as an evolutionary sequence where increasingly harsh radiation fields not only ionize the PAH population but also alter the surviving cations, consistent with the selective destruction of the carriers of the 7.7 micron feature.
#### Improving Air Shower Simulations by Tuning Pythia 8/Angantyr with Accelerator Data

 - **Abstract**
 We present a combined analysis of the Pythia 8 event generator using accelerator data and evaluate its impact on air shower observables. Reliable simulations with event generators are essential for particle physics analyses, achievable through advanced tuning to experimental data. Pythia 8 has emerged as a promising high-energy interaction model for cosmic ray air shower simulations, offering well-documented parameter settings and a user-friendly interface to enable automatic tuning efforts. Using data from collider and fixed-target experiments, we first derive tunes for each domain separately, before tuning both domains simultaneously. To achieve this, we define a core set of observables and quantify their dependence on selected parameters. The tuning efforts are based on gradient descent and Bayesian methods, the latter providing a full uncertainty propagation of the parameters to the observables. Results for the impact of a combined analysis for the Pythia 8/Angantyr event generator on air shower observables, such as particle densities at ground level and energy deposit profiles, are presented.

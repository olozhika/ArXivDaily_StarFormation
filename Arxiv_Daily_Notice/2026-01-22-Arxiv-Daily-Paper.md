#### Sample-efficient non-Gaussian noise reduction in gravitational wave data via learnable wavelets

 - **Abstract**
 We introduce $\texttt{WaveletNet}$, a wavelet-based neural network architecture to identify and reduce non-Gaussian noise in gravitational wave data. Traditionally, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been widely used as a flexible machine learning method to mitigate non-Gaussian noise. However, training CNNs requires many data samples, especially when the input data segments are long. Glitches that mimic high-mass black hole signals are empirically known to have a wavelet-like structure. We exploit this property in $\texttt{WaveletNet}$ by using simple neural networks to learn the best family of wavelets to model glitches in the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA O3 data. Due to its simplicity, our framework is significantly more sample-efficient than CNNs. As a use case, we build upon the $\texttt{TIER}$ method and show how $\texttt{WaveletNet}$ can improve the performance of any search pipeline. We take potential GW candidates from the pipeline, and then downweight the candidates having noisy strain regions in their vicinity. We use our framework in a modular way: we provide an output score which can be added to the pipeline's existing detection statistic score for the candidates. We test our method using candidates from the $\texttt{IAS-HM}$ search pipeline and show that it improves the search sensitive volume by up to 15% for high-mass, asymmetric binaries.
#### Cosmo-FOLD: Fast generation and upscaling of field-level cosmological maps with overlap latent diffusion

 - **Abstract**
 We demonstrate the capabilities of probabilistic diffusion models to reduce dramatically the computational cost of expensive hydrodynamical simulations to study the relationship between observable baryonic cosmological probes and dark matter at field level and well into the non-linear regime. We introduce a novel technique, Cosmo-FOLD (Cosmological Fields via Overlap Latent Diffusion) to rapidly generate accurate and arbitrarily large cosmological and astrophysical 3-dimensional fields, conditioned on a given input field. We are able to generate TNG300-2 dark matter density and gas temperature fields from a model trained only on ~1% of the volume (a process we refer to as `upscaling'), reproducing both large scale coherent dark matter filaments and power spectra to within 10% for wavenumbers k <= 5 h Mpc^-1. These results are obtained within a small fraction of the original simulation cost and produced on a single GPU. Beyond one and two points statistics, the bispectrum is also faithfully reproduced through the inclusion of positional encodings. Finally, we demonstrate Cosmo-FOLD's generalisation capabilities by upscaling a CAMELS volume of 25 (Mpc h^-1)^3 to a full TNG300-2 volume of 205 (Mpc h^-1)^3$ with no fine-tuning. Cosmo-FOLD opens the door to full field-level simulation-based inference on cosmological scale.
#### MeV absorption in gamma-ray bursts as a probe of their progenitor winds

 - **Abstract**
 A small fraction of X-ray photons from gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), after escaping the relativistic jet, are scattered by electrons in the circumburst medium. Subsequent photon-photon absorption between the incoming MeV $\gamma$-rays and the back-scattered X-rays generate electron-positron pairs, enriching the surrounding medium with leptons. We investigate how these back-scattered photons modify the prompt GRB spectrum through $\gamma-\gamma$ absorption. In a dense and pair-loaded wind environment, the emerging spectra exhibit a broad attenuation structure, whose morphology is sensitive to the low-energy spectral index $\alpha$. In particular, spectra with $\alpha > -1$ develop a pronounced, saddle-shaped absorption between 1 and 100 MeV (rest frame). Such external MeV absorption could account for the spectral curvature seen in some bright GRBs, and may point to enhanced mass loss from their progenitor stars, consistent with early observations of core-collapse supernovae.
#### The failed failed-supernova scenario of M31-2014-DS1

High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE)

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.14497

 - **Abstract**
 I examine a recently proposed failed-supernova scenario for the fading of the yellow supergiant event M31-2014-DS1, and find that it requires unlikely fine-tuned parameters to work, if at all. In the failed-supernova scenario, most of the yellow supergiant collapsed to form a black hole. Due to the energy carried by neutrinos from the cooling, collapsing core, gravity decreases, leading to the ejection of a small fraction of the outer envelope, some of which remains bound. The fallback accreted gas possesses large angular-momentum fluctuations due to the pre-collapse envelope convection. The fallback material forms intermittent accretion disks around the black hole that launch jets (or disk wind), which unbind most of the bound material. The failed-supernova scenario for M31-2014-DS1 requires that only <1% of the bound material be accreted by the black hole, but the jets do not shut down the backflow for over 10 years. I find this fine-tuned requirement unlikely. I also find that, due to the rapid radiative cooling of the outflow interaction zone with the outer gas, the expected radiation is about an order of magnitude or more above the observed value. These, as well as earlier challenges raised against the failed-supernova scenario, make the alternative type II intermediate-luminosity optical transient scenario, in which fading is due to dust ejection in a violent binary interaction, more likely. The fading event M31-2014-DS1 does not support the failed-supernova scenario predicted by the neutrino-driven explosion mechanism of core-collapse supernovae.
#### Searching for Isolated Black Hole Candidates within 15 pc of the Solar System in Gaia DR3

 - **Abstract**
 Theoretical models predict that the Galaxy hosts $10^8$-$10^9$ black holes formed from the complete gravitational collapse of heavy stars and that most of these black holes are isolated, without any companion. Within 15 pc of the Solar System ($\sim 50$ ly), there may be a few black holes. If located inside one of the Local Interstellar Clouds - which occupy 5-20% of this local volume - an isolated black hole could produce detectable electromagnetic emission via accretion from the interstellar medium, given the capabilities of current or near-future observatories. However, precise predictions remain challenging due to large uncertainties in the expected accretion spectra. Outside these clouds, the accretion rate would be too low in any standard model to yield a detectable electromagnetic signal. While astrometric detection via gravitational perturbation of nearby stars is conceivable, the local stellar density is too low for this method to be realistically successful. We have searched the Gaia DR3 catalog for candidate isolated black holes accreting from the interstellar medium and identified five sources. All candidates lie close to the Galactic plane, making them likely spurious astrometric solutions, for instance caused by unmodelled background sources (crowding) and/or unmodelled binarity; nevertheless, they cannot be definitively ruled out without follow-up observations.
#### Extra modes in helium-core-burning stars probing an infra core cavity

 - **Abstract**
 Dipole mixed modes observed in the oscillation pattern of red giant stars probe the radiative regions in the stellar core. Oscillation spectra of helium-core-burning stars sometimes show extra peaks that remain unexplained by the dipole mixed-mode pattern expected from the coupling of a radiative cavity in the stellar core and a pressure cavity in the stellar envelope. We use the asymptotic expansion developed for a multi-cavity star in order to characterize these extra peaks. The analytical resonance condition of the multi-cavity gravito-acoustic modes, with two inner gravity cavities and an outer pressure cavity, helps us explain that the apparent extra peaks are dipole mixed modes that follow the 3-cavity oscillation pattern. The derivation of the two asymptotic period spacings associated with the two distinct regions in the radiative core provides an estimate of the full radiative cavity. Our results provide new constraints for analysing the overshoot or mixing in the core of helium-core-burning stars. An important structure discontinuity inside the radiative core may explain the larger than expected observed period spacings.
#### Small scale turbulence alongside with large scale turbulence in a z~sim 2 star Forming Galaxy with outflowing wind, revealed by Multi-point structure functions

 - **Abstract**
 Recently, Goldman (2024) obtained evidence for a large scale compressible, Burgers turbulence in the ism of a gravitationally lensed, star-forming galaxy at $z = 1.87$, with an outflowing wind. The turbulent timescale on the largest spatial scale has been found to be ~500 Myr . This together with the large spatial scale of~ 6.4 kpc suggest a large scale generating mechanism (such as tidal interaction or merger) that lasted for ~500 Myr. On the other hand, the outflowing wind is much younger and is probably the result of the intense star formation. Therefore, could it be that the star formation drives also turbulence on small scales? In the present work we utilize multi-point second order structure functions to find whether there exists also a small scale turbulence in this galaxy, and if so, try to identify its drivers. We obtained evidence for small scale turbulence whose largest spatial scale ~240 pc for the nebular gas velocity field and ~ 290 pc$ for the outflowing wind velocity field. These values suggest that stellar sub clumps or giant star clusters with an high concentration of young massive stars could be responsible for both the outflow and for the small scale turbulence.

 - **Abstract**
 Aims. Massive stars impact their surrounding initiating star-formation along their photo-dissociation region. Once the HII region is formed it is unclear if and how the second generation of stars impacts its aspect and evolution. Methods. We performed high spectral resolution (R ~ 23400) Ha Fabry-Perot observations in five fields covering the Galactic HII region NGC 7538 and lead profiles multi-gaussian fitting to extract the parameters as peak intensity, width and velocity. We then analyse the kinematics of the ionised gas building kinematic diagrams and second order structure functions for every field. Results. The observations reveal a general blue-shifted ionised gas flow larger than 11 km s-1 in NGC 7538, consistent with previous studies. Profiles originating from features that are dark in Ha due to extinction or from outside the region show velocity dispersion larger than the one typically found for the Warm Interstellar Medium. The analysis of kinematic diagrams and second-order structure functions reveals non-thermal motions attributed to turbulence and large-scale velocity gradients. In the direction of the HII region itself the turbulence seems to be shock-dominated, with a characteristic scale length between ~ 0.72 and 1.46 pc. In this context, we propose that the kinematics of the central part of the region could be explained by the superposition of the outflow coming from IRS1 and a wind bow shock formed ahead IRS6.
#### A Theory of transmission spectroscopy of planetary winds: Spectral-line saturation and limits on mass-loss inference

 - **Abstract**
 Transmission spectroscopy is a key technique in the characterization of exoplanet atmospheres and has been widely applied to planets undergoing hydrodynamic escape. While a robust analytic theory exists for transmission spectra of hydrostatic atmospheres, the corresponding interpretation for escaping atmospheres has so far relied on numerical modeling. In this work, we develop a theory of transmission spectroscopy in hydrodynamically escaping atmospheres by coupling the standard transmission geometry to a steady-state, spherically symmetric, isothermal outflow. This approach yields closed-form expressions and allows the optical depth inversion problem to be examined. The analytic solution reveals that transmission spectroscopy of planetary winds naturally separates into two regimes. In an opacity-limited regime, transmission depths retain sensitivity to the atmospheric mass-loss rate. Beyond a critical threshold, however, spectral-line cores become saturated and no longer provide a unique constraint on the mass flux. This transition is marked by a sharp analytic boundary of the form $\sigma(\lambda)\times \dot M \le C_{sat}$, where $C_{sat}$ is a constant set by the thermodynamic and geometric properties of the wind. This condition specifies when the inversion between transmission depth and mass-loss rate admits a real solution. Once it is violated, the effective transit radius is no longer controlled by opacity or mass loss, but by the geometric extent of the absorbing wind. These results demonstrate that spectral-line saturation in transmission spectroscopy corresponds to a fundamental loss of invertibility between absorption and atmospheric mass loss, rather than a gradual weakening of sensitivity. The theory provides a physically transparent explanation for why strong transmission line cores often fail to constrain mass-loss rates, while weaker lines and line wings remain diagnostic.
#### Alkali recondensation into chondrules

 - **Abstract**
 While sub-mm melt droplets should rapidly lose alkali elements in a vacuum at liquidus temperatures, chondrules are only modestly depleted in them (by less than one order of magnitude). The detection of sodium in olivine cores has previously suggested very high saturating partial pressures of gaseous sodium, but we show that alkalis were lost during heating and recondensed at lower temperatures, essentially in the present-day chondrule mesostases. This recondensation was accompanied by mass-dependent enrichment in light isotopes (for multi-isotope alkalis such as K and Rb), but its limited extent indicates a cooling acceleration (or "quenching"). The isotopic fractionation also constrains the ratio of the chondrule density and the cooling rate prior to the quench around $10^{-6}\:\mathrm{kg.m^{-3}.K^{-1}.h}$ suggesting densities above $\sim 10^{-6}\:\mathrm{kg/m^3}$. In a nebular context, this is achievable by radial and vertical concentrations near pressure bumps.
#### Magneto-Archeology of White Dwarfs. Revisiting the fossil field scenario with observational constraints during the red giant branch

 - **Abstract**
 The detection of strong, large-scale magnetic fields at the surface of only the oldest population of white dwarfs might point towards a hidden internal magnetic field slowly rising to the surface. In addition, strong magnetic fields have recently been measured through asteroseismology in the radiative interiors of red giant stars, the progenitors of white dwarfs. To investigate the potential connection between these observations, we revisit the fossil field framework by using the asteroseismic detections to constrain the strength of such magnetic fields as they evolve to the white dwarf stage. We assume that the magnetic field was either created during the main sequence core convection or that it fills the radiative interior as the star evolves on the red giant branch. From these, we evolve the magnetic flux, allowing for magnetic diffusion along the evolution of a 1.5Msun modelled star. We find that measured field strengths in red giants attributed to the hydrogen-burning shell are compatible with the field amplitudes and emergence timescales of magnetized white dwarfs. On the contrary, magnetic fields generated solely from a convective-core dynamo on the main-sequence and detectable during the red giant branch would be buried too deep in the star and not match the breakout timescales and the field strengths of magnetic white dwarfs. A broadly magnetized internal radiative zone during the red giant branch is therefore key for the fossil field theory to connect magnetic fields observed along the late evolution of stars.

 - **Abstract**
 Planetesimal formation likely lasted for millions of years in the Solar nebula, and the cold classicals in the Kuiper belt are suggested to be the direct products of streaming instability. The presence of minor planetary bodies in the outer Solar System and the exo-Kuiper belts provide key constraints to planet formation models. In this work, we connected dust drift and coagulation, planetesimal formation, N-body gravity, pebble accretion, planet migration, planetary core accretion, gap opening, and internal photoevaporation in one modeling framework. We demonstrate that multiple classes of minor planets, or planetesimals, can form during disk dissipation and remain afterwards, including a scattered group, a resonant group and a dynamically cold group. Significant growth by pebble accretion was prevented by both dynamical heating due to the giant planet in the system and rapid dispersal of the disk towards the end of its lifetime. We also conducted a parameter study which showed that this is not a universal case, where the outcome is determined by the competition for dust between planetesimal formation and pebble accretion. Combining this scenario with sequential planet formation, this model provides a promising pathway towards an outer Solar System formation model.
#### The EBLM project XVI. Spin-orbit alignment of the low mass eclipsing binary EBLM J0021-16

 - **Abstract**
 Thousands of tight ($<1$ AU) main sequence binaries have been discovered, but it is uncertain how they formed. There is likely too much angular momentum in a collapsing, fragmenting protostellar cloud to form such binaries in situ, suggesting some post processing. One probe of a binary's dynamical history is the angle between the stellar spin and orbital axes -- its obliquity. The classical method for determining stellar obliquity is the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect. It has been applied to over 100 hot Jupiters, but to less than a dozen stellar binaries. In this paper, we present the Rossiter-McLaughlin measurement of EBLM J0021-16, a $0.19M_\odot$ M-dwarf eclipsing a $1.05M_\odot$ G-dwarf on a 5.97 day, almost-circular orbit. We combine CORALIE spectroscopy with TESS photometry of primary and secondary eclipses and star spot modulation. We show that the orbital axis is well-aligned with the primary star's spin axis, with a true 3D obliquity of $\psi=4.01\pm0.54^{\circ}$. EBLM J0021-16 becomes one of only a handful of eclipsing binaries where a true obliquity has been measured. Finally, we derive the M-dwarf's mass and radius to a fractional precision better than 1\%. The radius of the M dwarf is inflated by 6\% ($7.4\sigma$) with respect to stellar models, consistent with many other M-dwarfs in the literature.
#### Limb Asymmetries on WASP-39b: A Multi-GCM Comparison of Chemistry, Clouds, and Hazes

 - **Abstract**
 With JWST, observing separate spectra of the morning and evening limbs of hot Jupiters has finally become a reality. The first such observation was reported for WASP-39b, where the evening terminator was observed to have a larger transit radius by about 400 ppm and a stronger 4.3 $\mu$m CO$_2$ feature than the morning terminator. Multiple factors, including temperature differences, photo/thermochemistry, clouds and hazes, could cause such limb asymmetries. To interpret these new limb asymmetry observations, a detailed understanding of how the relevant processes affect morning and evening spectra grounded in forward models is needed. Focusing on WASP-39b, we compare simulations from five different general circulation models (GCMs), including one simulating disequilibrium thermochemistry and one with cloud radiative feedback, to the recent WASP-39b limb asymmetry observations. We also post-process the temperature structures of all simulations with a 2D photochemical model and one simulation with a cloud microphysics model. Although the temperatures predicted by the different models vary considerably, the models are remarkably consistent in their predicted morning--evening temperature differences. Several equilibrium-chemistry simulations predict strong methane features in the morning spectrum, not seen in the observations. When including disequilibrium processes, horizontal transport homogenizes methane, and these methane features disappear. However, even after including photochemistry and clouds, our models still cannot reproduce the observed ${\sim}2000$ ppm asymmetry in the CO$_2$ feature. A combination of factors, such as varying metallicity and unexplored parameters in cloud models, may explain the discrepancy, emphasizing the need for future models integrating cloud microphysics and feedback across a broader parameter space.
#### Adaptive Reconstruction of Cluster Halos (ARCH): Integrating Shear and Flexion for Substructure Detection
 - **Authors:** Jacob Shpiece, David M. Goldberg
 - **Subjects:** Subjects:
Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO)
 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21686

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.21686

 - **Abstract**
 We present ARCH (Adaptive Reconstruction of Cluster Halos), a new gravitational lensing pipeline for cluster mass reconstruction that applies a joint shear-flexion analysis to JWST imaging. Previous approaches have explored joint shear+flexion reconstructions through forward modeling and Bayesian inference frameworks; in contrast, ARCH adopts a staged optimization strategy that incrementally filters and selects candidate halos rather than requiring a global likelihood model or strong priors. This design makes reconstruction computationally tractable and flexible, enabling systematic tests of multiple signal combinations within a unified framework. ARCH employs staged candidate generation, local optimization, filtering, forward selection, and global strength refinement, with a combined fit metric weighted by per-signal uncertainties. Applies to Abell 2744 and El Gordo, the pipeline recovers convergence maps and subcluster masses consistent with published weak+strong lensing results. In Abell 2744 the central core mass within 300$h^{-1}$ kpc is $2.1\times 10^{14} M_\odot h^{-1}$, while in El Gordo the northwestern and southeastern clumps are recovered at $2.6\times 10^{14} M_\odot h^{-1}$ and $2.3\times 10^{14} M_\odot h^{-1}$. Jackknife resampling indicates typical 1$\sigma$ uncertainties of $10^{12}-10^{13} M_\odot h^{-1}$, with the all signal and shear+$\mathcal{F}$ reconstructions providing the most stable results. These results demonstrate that flexion, when anchored by shear, enhances sensitivity to cluster substructure while maintaining stable cluster-scale mass recovery.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a substantial update to the MESA Isochrones and Stellar Tracks (MIST) library, extending the MIST model grids and isochrones down the white dwarf (WD) cooling sequence with realistic physics for WD cooling timescales. This work provides a large grid of MESA models for carbon-oxygen core WDs with hydrogen atmospheres (spectral type DA/DC), descended from full prior stellar evolution calculations. The model tracks, isochrones, and WD cooling timescale contours are available on the MIST project website and at this https URL. Our WD models provide a very large, publicly available grid with detailed physics for WD cooling timescales: realistic interior and envelope compositions, with element diffusion and heavy-element sedimentation, nuclear burning at the base of the WD hydrogen envelope, core crystallization, and C/O phase separation. As a large grid of open-source stellar evolution models, these WD models provide both out-of-the-box model tracks for comparison with observations and a framework for building further WD models to investigate variations in WD physics.
#### Helium-burning blue large-amplitude pulsators: A Population Study with BPASS

 - **Abstract**
 Blue Large-Amplitude Pulsators (BLAPs) are a class of radially pulsating stars with effective temperatures ranging from 20,000 to 35,000 K and pulsation periods between 7 and 75 minutes. This study utilizes the Binary Population and Spectral Synthesis (BPASS) code to investigate helium-burning stars as a formation channel for BLAPs in the Milky Way. The progenitor stars have initial masses of 3-6 $M_{\odot}$, resulting in BLAPs with final masses of 0.5-1.2 $M_{\odot}$. Based on a constant star formation rate of 3 $ M_{\odot}\text{yr}^{-1}$ and solar metallicity (Z = 0.020), population synthesis predicts approximately 14,351 helium-burning BLAPs in the Milky Way: 12,799 with Main Sequence (MS) companions and 1,551 with evolved/compact-object companions. Helium-burning BLAPs show prolonged lifetimes in the pulsation region and a narrow stellar age range for entering this regime (log(t/yr) = 8.0-8.6), unlike pre-white dwarf models. BLAPs with MS companions typically form via Roche lobe overflow, leading to longer orbital periods ($\sim$100 days). Those with evolved/compact-object companions form through common envelope evolution, resulting in shorter periods. While Galactic extinction makes most BLAPs faint (apparent magnitudes $>$ 25), future surveys like WFST and VRO LSST are expected to detect approximately 500-900. This research establishes helium-burning stars as a significant BLAP contributor and offers testable predictions regarding their binary properties and Galactic distribution.
#### Fermi detection of $γ$-rays from the radio-quiet Seyfert galaxy NGC 3281

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.21958

 - **Abstract**
 We report the detection of significant $\gamma$-ray emission with $\it Fermi$-LAT from the radio-quiet Seyfert 2 galaxy NGC 3281, with a luminosity of $5.9\,(\pm 1.7)\times10^{41}\rm\,erg\,s^{-1}$ at a significance of $6.22\,\sigma$ (TS = $42.81$). The power-law photon index is $2.61~(\pm 0.24)$, indicative of a soft spectrum. The star formation activity in NGC 3281 is insufficient to explain its $\gamma$-ray luminosity based on the empirical relation between the infrared and $\gamma$-ray luminosities observed in other sources. The multiwavelength spectrum can be explained as due to inverse Compton scattering by relativistic electrons in the corona or jet of seed photons from the corona, disk and torus. The source is Compton-thick and attenuation of GeV photons due to pair production in the corona is nonnegligible (with an optical depth of about 10). The intrinsic $\gamma$-ray luminosity is inferred to be $3.4\,\times10^{42}$ and $2.2\,\times10^{41}\rm\,erg\,s^{-1}$ for the corona and jet model, respectively. The observed $\gamma$-ray and radio luminosities is roughly consistent with the known correlation between the two quantities, among the lowest luminosity regime. The jet origin is valid only if the radio emission is dominated by the jet.
#### Origin of gas in the Magellanic Bridge: MeerKAT detection of HI 21-cm absorption

 - **Abstract**
 HI 21-cm absorption lines are investigated to determine the origin of the neutral atomic hydrogen (HI) of the Magellanic Bridge (MB). Using the MeerKat Absorption Line Survey (MALS) data we report the detection of an HI absorption line at a peak signal-to-noise ratio of 10 caused by MB gas against the radio source J033242.97-724904.5. In combination with earlier data obtained with the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) our new detected HI line permits the exploration of the MB atomic hydrogen gas across 4-6 kpc. The radial velocity profiles from the ATCA data and new data from MALS are analysed. Apart from the excitation conditions, the radial velocity structure of the HI gas seen in emission and absorption is investigated. Eventually the gas-to-dust ratio is quantified to identify the origin of the MB gas being either from the SMC (Small Magellanic Cloud) or the LMC (Large Magellanic Cloud). The HI absorption lines towards lines of sight separated by several kpc consistently coincide with the densest and perhaps coolest gas at the lower radial-velocity limit of the corresponding HI emission profiles. The gas-to-dust ratio is found to be consistent with an origin of the MB gas from the LMC. The large scale velocity distribution as seen from the HI absorption features favors the LMC-SMC direct collision scenario over the close fly-by scenario, as also currently found by numerical simulations.
#### Revisiting 3C 279 jet morphology with space VLBI at 26 microarcsecond resolution

 - **Abstract**
 We present observations of the blazar 3C 279 at 22 GHz using the space VLBI mission RadioAstron on 2018 January 15. Images in both total intensity and fractional polarization are reconstructed using RML method implemented in the eht-imaging library. The electric vector position angles are found to be mostly aligned with the general jet direction, suggesting a predominantly toroidal magnetic field, in agreement with the presence of a helical magnetic field. Ground-space fringes were detected up to a projected baseline length of $\sim 8$G$\lambda$, achieving the angular resolution of around 26$\mu$as. The fine-scale structure of the relativistic jet is found in our study extending to a projected distance of $\sim 180$ parsec from the radio core. However, the filamentary structure reported by previous RadioAstron observations of 2014 is not detected in our current study. We discuss potential causes for this phenomenon, together with a comparison using public 43 GHz data from the BEAM-ME program, showing a significant drop in the jet's total intensity. The optically thick core is observed with a brightness temperature of $ 1.6 \times 10^{12}$ K, consistent with equipartition between the energy densities of the relativistic particles and the magnetic field. This yields an estimated magnetic field strength of 0.2 G.
#### Detection of HI filament: Pair Stacking vs. Filament Stacking

 - **Abstract**
 It is anticipated that the faint 21 cm signal emitted by neutral hydrogen within cosmic filaments can be detected. However, because of the signal's weakness, stacking techniques are necessary. We assessed two stacking methods--pair stacking and filament stacking--using the EAGLE and IllustrisTNG simulations. Pair stacking leverages the fact that cosmic filaments serve as the connectors between cosmic web nodes, while filament stacking directly aggregates cosmic filaments identified by galaxy distributions. Our analysis indicates that, although pair stacking is convenient, it faces contamination from massive structures, the signal from filament gets very weak after the contamination is removed. Conversely, HI detection via filament stacking appears more viable. The column density exceeds $10^{17} \,{\rm cm}^{-2}$ even when all halos are masked, and it is nearly 10 times higher than what is achieved with pair stacking. The effectiveness of filament stacking could further increase with a high number density galaxy catalog and better spatial resolution in radio observation intensity mapping. With the advent of new optical and radio data, the future detection of HI filaments looks promising.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Recent Monte Carlo simulations and laboratory studies of interstellar ices have proposed an alternative pathway involving the radical-molecule H-atom abstraction reaction in the overall mechanism of methanol (CH3OH) formation in dark molecular clouds. Aims. A computational study was conducted to investigate the contribution of the radical-molecule H-atom abstraction route in CH3OH formation in interstellar ices, both in non-shocked and shocked environments, and to examine how the physical conditions of the interstellar medium (ISM) affect the overall CH3OH synthesis pathway. Methods. A set of chemical models were ran using the gas-grain chemical code UCLCHEM to systematically explore methanol synthesis in various physical scenarios, including non-shock and low- and high-velocity C-shocks. Results. This work demonstrated for the first time that, under non-shock and shocked-influenced environments, the primary reaction leading to the formation of methanol in the inner layers of interstellar ices is indeed the radical-molecule H-atom abstraction route. However, such route is dependent on the gas kinetic temperature (Tk), gas volume density (nH2 ), velocity of the C-shock wave (vshock), and cosmic ray ionisation rate ({\zeta}). Furthermore, gaseous formaldehyde may trace C-type shocks and serve to differentiate methanol formation pathways in low-velocity C-shocked environments, as its abundance varies more significantly than that of CH3OH with the inclusion of the H-atom abstraction reaction in UCLCHEM. The H2CO/CH3OH ratio thus represents a potential diagnostic tool for this purpose.
#### The Diamond Ring in Cygnus X: Advanced stage of an expanding bubble of ionised carbon

 - **Abstract**
 The "Diamond Ring" in Cygnus X, southwest of the DR21 ridge, is a nearly circular structure of $\sim$6 pc in diameter, prominent in FIR emission and enclosed by clumpy molecular clouds traced in CO. It hosts an HII region, visible in cm emission, and resembles a classical expanding HII bubble routinely seen in the 158 $\mu$m [CII] line. However, SOFIA FEEDBACK observations in the spectrally resolved [CII] line reveal instead a slightly tilted ring of $\sim$10$^3$ M$_\odot$ expanding slowly at $\sim$1.3 km s$^{-1}$, with a bulk line-of-sight (LOS) velocity near $-2$ km s$^{-1}$. The central "Diamond" is an unrelated dense clump at $\sim$7 km s$^{-1}$. The driving source, classified from IR spectroscopy, is a B0.5e star that powers the HII region. Unlike typical 3D shells, this marks the first case where we detect only a slowly expanding CII ring. We suggest the HII region and CII bubble, initially formed by a massive star, expanded outward from a flat slab of molecular gas nearly in the plane of the sky. The ring is now confined by swept-up material of the slab, while shell components moving perpendicular to the LOS have dissipated, leading to a reduction in expansion. Dedicated simulations tracing the evolution of the CII bubble support this geometry, consistent with previous reports of HII region evolution in flat molecular clouds. We propose that the "Diamond Ring" represents the terminal phase of an expanding CII bubble driven by stellar winds and thermal pressure.
#### Tomographic Distance Measurements to the Smith Cloud with SDSS-V Milky Way Mapper3

 - **Abstract**
 High velocity clouds supply the Milky Way with gas that sustains star formation over cosmic timescales. Precise distance measurements are therefore essential to quantify their mass inflow rates and gauge their exact contribution to the Galaxy's gas supply. We use a sample of 1,293 SDSS-V BOSS stellar spectra within 10 degrees of the high-velocity Smith Cloud (SC) to trace Na I absorption and dust extinction as functions of distance. By fitting ISM-corrected MaStar templates to each spectrum, we isolate residual equivalent widths and extinction then compare trends in the SC region to a same-latitude control field. Stars beyond 1 kpc toward the SC exhibit a significant Na I equivalent width excess ($>$0.1 Angstroms, $>$3sigma) relative to the control. Joint fits of Na I equivalent width and Av against both low and high-velocity H I column densities show that the low-velocity component is strongly correlated with both quantities, while the high-velocity term is marginally significant in extinction and consistent with zero in Na I, consistent with a patchy, low dust-to-gas ratio. Given that the excess Na I begins at distances $<2$ kpc uniquely in the direction of the Cloud, and previous estimates of the SC place it at 12.4 $\pm$ 1.3 kpc, further investigation of its distance is warranted.

#### Searching for the Shortest-wavelength Aromatic Infrared Bands: No Evidence for the Predicted 1.05 $μ$m Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon Feature

 - **Abstract**
 Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are responsible for a variety of near- and mid-infrared spectral features in Galactic and extragalactic sources. A feature at 1.05 $\mu$m arising from electronic transitions in PAH cations is predicted by laboratory experiments but has never been observationally confirmed. We conduct a dedicated search for this feature in absorption on a highly-extinguished sight line toward BD+40 4223, a blue supergiant in Cyg OB2, using the TripleSpec spectrograph at Palomar Observatory. We place a $5\sigma$ upper limit on the feature strength of $\Delta\tau_{1.05}/A_{V} < 5.6 \times10^{-3}$, ruling out theoretical estimates with $> 10\sigma$ significance. We constrain the effective temperature of BD+40 4223 to be $\log_{10}\left(T_{\rm eff}\right)=4.41\pm0.03$ and infer that it is veiled by $6.39\pm0.05$ magnitudes of visual extinction, consistent with but more constraining than previous determinations. As dust on the sight line toward BD+40 4223 appears typical of the diffuse interstellar medium, this non-detection challenges existing models of PAH material properties and/or charge distribution.
#### Cosmological Simulation with Population III Stellar Feedback and Metal Enrichment I: Model Description And Convergence Test

 - **Abstract**
 We present a new Pop III + Pop II subgrid framework implemented in the moving-mesh code {\sc arepo}, designed to study the impact of Pop III feedback on star formation in the early universe. The framework combines primordial non-equilibrium chemistry, metal-line cooling, IMF-sampled stellar evolution with SN feedback, and approximate Lyman-Werner (LW) and ionizing radiation transport. We run a suite of $1c{\rm Mpc}/h$ box simulations with different initial conditions and resolutions from $z=127$ to $z=10$. The highest gas mass and spatial resolution in the fiducial simulation reach $\sim10\,{\rm M_{\odot}}$ and $\sim4\,{\rm pc}$, respectively. The model successfully reproduces the UV-inferred Pop II star formation rate density (SFRD) from recent JWST observations across all initial conditions, with only minor variation driven by local halo interactions and LW irradiation. We find that the volume filling factor of metal-enriched gas converges to $\sim1\%$ at $z=10$. Convergence is achieved once subhalos with $M_{\rm subhalo}\gtrsim 10^{6.5}\,{\rm M_{\odot}}$ are resolved, and the total stellar mass at $z=10$ is largely insensitive to initial conditions or the resolution considered in this work. A fiducial simulation requires $\sim 10^4$ CPU hours, making the framework computationally tractable for larger box simulations and enabling future large parameter studies of stellar physics or environment effects such as Pop III IMF variations, X-ray radiation, or the streaming velocity at high redshift.

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.12531

 - **Abstract**
 Traditional interstellar polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) diagnostics rely on empirical band ratios, which often suffer from information loss and sample-selection bias. We introduce a machine learning framework that bypasses these limitations by treating the complete 2.75-20 micron emission spectrum as a high-dimensional fingerprint. Using a Random Forest classifier trained on a dataset of 23,653 spectra, we achieve a robust classification F1-score of about 0.96 across 12 size and charge categories. Our model maintains high performance on synthetic mixtures of unseen molecules. Feature importance analysis reveals that PAH size diagnostics are not universal but highly charge-dependent; while neutral size is traced mainly by C-H stretching modes, sizing ionized species also relies on the morphology of 6-8 micron C-C complexes, with the 12.5 micron feature emerging as a robust cross-charge tracer. This approach provides a robust, data-driven pathway for decoding the physical conditions of the interstellar medium.
#### ALMA Band 9 CO(6--5) Reveals a Warm Ring Structure Associated with the Embedded Protostar in the Cold Dense Core MC 27/L1521F

 - **Abstract**
 Infall and outflows, coupled with magnetic fields, rapidly structure the gas around newborn protostars. Shocks from interacting components encode the temperature and density distribution, offering a direct probe of the earliest evolution history. However, interferometric observations characterizing warm envelopes using high-excitation lines remain scarce. We present ALMA Band 9 observations of the Taurus dense core MC 27/L1521F, which hosts a Class 0 protostar, targeting the CO($J$=6-5) line at an angular resolution of $\sim$2\arcsec\ ($\approx$300 au). We detect an off-centered ring-like structure with a diameter of $\sim$1000 au that was not identifiable in previous low-$J$ CO data, where emission close to the systemic velocity is strongly affected by optical depth. The ring shows a typical peak brightness temperature of $\sim$3 K at our resolution. Excitation considerations indicate that the detected CO($J$=6-5) emission likely arises from relatively warm ($T \gtrsim 20$ K) and dense ($n({\rm H_2}) \gtrsim 10^{5}$ cm$^{-3}$) gas embedded within the surrounding cold, dense core. The morphology and kinematics suggest an energetic and localized shock-heating event, potentially linked to dynamical gas--magnetic-field interactions in the earliest protostellar phase. Our results demonstrate that high-$J$ CO observations provide a powerful new window on warm and dense gas components, enabling a more direct view of the physical processes operating at the onset of star formation.

 - **Abstract**
 Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) stars significantly contribute to the chemical composition of the universe. In their outflows, complex chemistry takes place, which critically depends on the local temperature. Therefore, if we want to accurately model the AGB environment, we need accurate cooling rates. The CO molecule is abundant in AGB outflows, and has a dipole moment, which enables it to cool through emission from its rotational transitions. We therefore expect it to significantly contribute to cooling in this environment, even at low temperatures ($10$ K $\leqslant T\leqslant 3000$ K). Currently, CO cooling rates are available for ISM-like conditions, which encompasses a different parameter regime, with generally lower densities and velocity gradients, compared to AGB winds. Therefore, these ISM cooling rates might not be applicable to the AGB regime. In this paper, we compute CO cooling rates for hydrodynamics simulations of AGB outflows. To evaluate the net cooling rate, we calculate the energy level distribution of CO self-consistently, using the non Local Thermodynamical Equilibrium (NLTE) line radiative transfer code Magritte. We verify whether already existing CO cooling rate prescriptions for the interstellar medium (ISM) are applicable for this regime. We noticed minor differences between these prescriptions and our calculated cooling rates in general. However, when used far outside their originally intended parameter regimes, significant differences occur. Therefore, we propose a new CO cooling rate prescription for the AGB environment and we study how the computed cooling rate varies depending on input parameters.
#### Tracking the dynamical, chemical and spectral evolution of molecular cores with PrestaLine: Gorynych

 - **Abstract**
 We present PrestaLine: Gorynych, a comprehensive numerical tool designed to model the dynamical, chemical, and spectral evolution of collapsing molecular cores from the prestellar phase to protostellar accretion. The code integrates three key components: (1) Kamelung, a 1D hydrodynamics module simulating gravitational collapse up to first hydrostatic core (FHSC) formation followed by an accretion of envelope onto a young star; (2) Presta, a chemical evolution module post-processing density and temperature profiles to compute time-dependent molecular abundances; and (3) Uran(IA), a radiative transfer module generating synthetic molecular line spectra. We apply Gorynych to compare low-mass (5 Msun) and high-mass (50 Msun) cores, finding that their dynamical evolution is remarkably similar, with differences primarily in spatial scaling. Chemical evolution reveals sharp abundance changes during the FHSC transition, particularly for CO, H2O, and HCO+, though pre-collapse chemical initialization has minimal impact on most species. Spectral maps of 13CO(2-1), HCO+(3-2), and H2O(110--101) lines show distinct kinematic signatures of infall and depletion, with high-mass cores exhibiting spatially extended emission. Our results highlight Gorynych's utility to couple theoretical collapse models and observations, providing a framework to diagnose core evolution and initial conditions from molecular line data.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the multi-temperature structure of the intracluster medium (ICM) in the Centaurus cluster core observed with XRISM/Resolve. Thanks to its high energy resolution, Resolve enables us to measure fine structures of highly ionized emission lines from Si to Fe and to directly determine the excitation temperature and the ionization temperature from the emission line ratio diagnostics. The observed spectrum in the Centaurus core is well-represented by a double-temperature thermal plasma at collisional ionization equilibrium state rather than an isothermal one. The line ratio diagnostics also support this biphasic temperature structure. Particularly, the observed line ratios show a trend of increasing ionization temperature with atomic mass, while the ionization and excitation temperatures of Fe show nearly the same temperature. The resultant line ratios, which are well-represented by the two temperatures ICM, ~ 1.6 and ~ 3 keV, are also fairly consistent with the expected numbers when assuming the radial single-temperature ICM was projected in the cluster core along the line of sight. Due to the limited low-energy sensitivity of the Resolve with the gate valve closed, we investigated the effect of the cool component using the XMM-Newton/RGS spectrum, but it ultimately did not affect our results. The observed flux ratio between the Fe XXV He alpha resonance and forbidden lines shows an about 20% reduction, suggesting the presence of resonant scattering.
#### Gaps and Rings: A Near-Universal Trait of Extended Protoplanetary Discs

 - **Abstract**
 Substructures such as rings, gaps, and cavities are commonly observed in protoplanetary discs and are thought to play a key role in dust evolution and planet formation. However, a fraction of the extended discs (68% dust radii > 30 AU) in nearby star-forming regions remain unresolved, leaving their substructure content uncertain and thereby limiting our understanding of dust evolution and the initial conditions for planet formation across the full disc population. We aim to investigate the presence of substructures in previously unresolved, extended discs to assess whether all extended protoplanetary discs in the Solar neighbourhood exhibit substructures. We present new high-resolution ($\sim$0.12") ALMA Band 6 continuum observations at 1.33 mm of 26 previously unresolved, extended discs within 200 pc, completing the high-resolution sample of extended discs in Taurus, Ophiuchus, Chamaeleon, Lupus, Upper Scorpius, Upper Centaurus-Lupus and Lower Centaurus-Crux. We analyse radial intensity profiles using Frankenstein and Galario to detect substructures. Seventeen discs show clear substructures, while nine appear compact and structureless, smooth or ambiguous due to inclination or possible binarity/late-stage infall. We detect $^{12}$CO J=2-1 emission in 15 discs, with extended emission in four. Combined with literature data, our complete sample of 730 protoplanetary discs reveals that nearly all extended discs exhibit substructures, $\sim$91% detected in the full sample, and up to $\sim$98% when correcting for high-inclination systems where substructures may be hidden. Substructures are a near-universal feature of extended protoplanetary discs. They are more commonly detected in larger, massive discs and around higher-mass stars, and structured discs retain their dust mass over time. This supports the scenario in which dust traps, possibly induced by giant planets, shape disc morphologies.
#### H$_2$ Ortho-Para Spin Conversion on Inhomogeneous Grain Surfaces. II. impact of the rotational energy difference between adsorbed ortho-H$_2$ and para-H$_2$ and implication to deuterium fractionation chemistry

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate how the H$_2$ ortho-to-para ratio (OPR) and dueterium fractionation in star-forming regions are affected by nuclear spin conversion (NSC) on dust grains. Particular focus is placed on the rotational energy difference between ortho-H$_2$ (o-H$_2$) and para-H$_2$ (p-H$_2$) on grain surfaces. While the ground state of o-H$_2$ has a higher rotational energy than that of p-H$_2$ by 170.5 K in the gas phase, this energy difference is expected to become smaller on solid surfaces, where interactions between the surface and adsorbed H$_2$ molecules affect their rotational motion. A previous study by Furuya et al. (2019) developed a rigorous formulation of the rate for the temporal variation of the H$_2$ OPR via the NSC on grains, assuming that adsorbed o-H$_2$ has higher rotational energy than adsorbed p-H$_2$ by 170.5 K, as in the gas phase. In this work, we relax the assumption and re-evaluate the rate, varying the rotational energy difference between their ground states. The re-evaluated rate is incorporated into a gas-ice astrochemical model to study the evolution of the H$_2$ OPR and the deuterium fractionation in prestellar cores and the outer, cold regions of protostellar envelopes. The inclusion of the NSC on grains reduces the timescale of the H2 OPR evolution and thus the deuterium fractionation, at densities of >10$^4$ cm$^{-3}$ and temperatures of <14-16 K (depending on the rotational energy difference), when the ionization rate of H$_2$ is 10$^{-17}$ s$^{-1}$.

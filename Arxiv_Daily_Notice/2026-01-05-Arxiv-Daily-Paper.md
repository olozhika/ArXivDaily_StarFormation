#### Born in the Dark: The Catastrophic Collapse of Fuzzy Dark Matter Solitons as the Origin of Little Red Dots

 - **Abstract**
 JWST surveys have uncovered a population of compact, red sources ("Little Red Dots," LRDs) at $z \ge 5$ that exhibit broad Balmer emission yet remain X-ray faint, implying heavy obscuration with $N_H \ge 10^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$. We propose that LRDs may trace a short-lived, obscured phase associated with rapid baryonic inflow inside the deep solitonic cores of fuzzy dark matter (FDM) halos. Combining the soliton size scaling with (i) the observed compact radii ($r_e \sim 30-100$ pc) and (ii) the requirement that Compton-thick columns be achievable within a region of order the core radius, we find that particle masses $m$ few $\times 10^{-22}$ eV are plausible for soliton masses $M_s \sim 10^8 - 10^9 M_\odot$; we adopt $m_{22}=2$ as a fiducial choice. A conservative mass-budget estimate for the obscuring column, together with isothermal hydrostatic stratification, indicates that configurations reaching $N_H \ge 10^{24} - 10^{25}$ cm$^{-2}$ require densities for which radiative losses (cooling and/or diffusion) occur faster than the dynamical time, suggesting that a long-lived static hot atmosphere is unlikely (an "Opacity Crisis") and that rapid inflow or radiation-pressure-driven evolution is favored. Using $512^3$ pseudo-spectral Schrödinger-Poisson simulations of idealized soliton mergers, we illustrate that compact, high-density soliton cores can form via violent relaxation under representative scalings. We discuss observational implications and tests, and outline the need for future radiation-hydrodynamic modeling to predict demographics and detailed spectra.
#### Measurement of the extragalactic background light at 8600Å using dark cloud shadow and the CaII-triplet lines

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.00308

 - **Abstract**
 We present results of a measurement of the near infrared Extragalactic Background Light using the dark-cloud method. Long-slit spectra covering the opaque core of the intermediate--latitude globule DC303.8-14.2 and the almost unobscured off area were measured using nodding-along-the-slit measuring technique providing a differential spectrum free of most of the foreground components. A template for the only remaining major foreground component, the scattered integrated starlight dominated by the strong Ca II triplet lines at 8498, 8542, 8664$Å$, from the dark core itself was constructed using the GAIA RVS spectral database. The derived EBL intensity is $1.62\pm 0.76(\sigma_{stat})\, 10^{-9} erg\, cm^{-2} s^{-1}Å^{-1} sr^{-1}$ or $13.8\pm6.5(\sigma_{stat})$nW m$^{-2}$sr$^{-1}$; this represents a tentative detection at $2.1\sigma$, level.

 - **Abstract**
 Supernova (SN) 2025coe at a distance of $\sim$25 Mpc is the third-closest calcium-strong (CaST) transient. It was discovered at a large projected offset of $\sim$34 kpc from its potential host galaxy NGC 3277. Multiband photometry of SN 2025coe indicates the presence of two peaks at day $\sim$2 and day $\sim$11 after explosion. Modeling the bolometric light curve, we find that the first peak can be reproduced either by shock cooling of a compact envelope ($R_\mathrm{env}$ $\approx $6-40 $R_{\odot}$; $M_\mathrm{env}$ $\approx $0.1-0.2 $M_{\odot}$) or by interaction with close-in circumstellar material (CSM; $R_{\mathrm{CSM}} \lesssim 8 \times10^{14}$ cm), or a combination of both. The second peak is dominated by radioactive decay of $^{56}$Ni ($M_{\mathrm{ej}} \approx $0.4-0.5 $M_{\odot}$; $M_{^{56}\mathrm{Ni}} \approx 1.4 \times 10^{-2}$ $M_{\odot}$). SN 2025coe rapidly evolves from the photospheric phase dominated by He I P-Cygni profiles to nebular phase spectra dominated by strong [Ca II] $\lambda \lambda$7291, 7323 and weak [O I] $\lambda \lambda$6300, 6364 emission lines. Simultaneous line profile modeling of [Ca II] and [O I] at nebular phases shows that an asymmetric core-collapse explosion of a low-mass ($\lesssim$3.3 $M_{\odot}$) He-core progenitor can explain the observed line profiles. Alternatively, lack of local star formation at the site of the SN explosion combined with a low ejecta mass is also consistent with a thermonuclear explosion due to a low-mass hybrid He-C/O white dwarf + C/O white dwarf merger.

 - **Abstract**
 Cloud coverage is one of the crucial elements of site testing in astronomy. All-sky camera (ASC) images are beneficial for our research on cloud coverage. In this paper, we propose ASCNet, an innovative model specifically designed for classifying nighttime ASC images collected at the Muztagh-ata site from 2022 March to 2024 June. ASCNet integrates ResNet34 with an ASCModule, which employs Depthwise Dilated Convolution and embeds lightweight Squeeze-and-Excitation attention within its branches to extract fine-grained texture information from the luminance channel. The data set is partitioned by category, with 70% of images assigned to the training set and 30% to the test set. The model's performance is assessed by comparing its predictions on the test set with manually annotated labels, yielding a consistency rate of 92.7%. All evaluation metrics of ASCNet are as follows: Accuracy 92.66%, Precision 83.26%, Recall 84.25%, and F1-Score 83.67%, and both ablation and comparative experiments demonstrate significant superiority over other models. A confusion matrix is utilized to analyze the differences between manual classification and model classification. The statistical results demonstrate the model's excellent classification performance and its robust generalization ability, illustrating that ASCNet has potential for application in future astronomical image classifications.
#### Hadronic Origin of Sub-PeV Gamma-Ray Emission from LHAASO J0621+3755

 - **Abstract**
 Very High Energy (VHE) gamma rays are primarily estimated to arise from high-energy electromagnetic interactions in pulsars and their halo through electron inverse Compton (IC) scattering. Hadronic channels like neutral pion decay have also been proposed to produce TeV-PeV gamma rays from the Pulsar halo. The neutral pions are expected to be generated from cosmic ray (CR) protons interacting with the ambient/cloud. The recent observations of sub-PeV gamma rays from the halo of pulsar PSR J0622+3749 by the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory Kilometre-Square Array (LHAASO-KM2A) detector provide a platform to explore different channels of their production. Previous studies support consistency with the leptonic modeling of the halo, which attributes its origin to slow diffusion in the interstellar medium. In this work, we investigated the possibility of proton-proton channel as the origin of these photons. To explain the observed gamma rays with energy $\sim 4$ TeV by the High-Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) telescope till 200 TeV by the LHAASO observatory, one requires the CR proton luminosity to be $\eta_p\sim 0.1$ of the pulsar PSR J0622+3749 spin-down luminosity. In this case, we have considered the protons propagating in a one-zone superdiffusion environment, specifically $\alpha = 1$ in a cloud of gas density 1 per cm$^{3}$.

 - **Abstract**
 Complex organic molecules (COMs), the building blocks of life, have been extensively detected under various physical conditions, from quiescent clouds to star-forming regions. They therefore serve as excellent tracers for the local physical and chemical properties of these environments. Proper models that are capable of grasping the formation and destruction of COMs are crucial to understanding observations. However, given that distinct COMs may be detected from different locations and at varying times, we improve UCLCHEM - a gas-grain chemical code - to a one-dimensional, time-dependent model, tailored to protostars. In this update, we examine two stages of a protostar: the prestellar and heating stages, incorporating a simple radiative mechanism for both the internal and external radiation fields of the cloud. This approach relies on the key assumption that the dust and gas temperatures are completely coupled. Ultimately, we implement an updated version of our model to interpret observations obtained through both single-dish and interferometry under varying conditions, including a SgrB2(N1) hot core, massive Galactic clumps and a hot core in Orion. We show that our model could reproduce these observations well, highlighting that some COMs are positioned at a higher temperature in the envelope, whereas others are from the lower temperature, potentially leading to misinterpretation when using a single-point model. In a particular case of SgrB2(N1), the best model indicates that the cosmic-ray ionisation rate significantly exceeds the value typically used for the standard interstellar medium. Our model shows as an efficient computational tool particularly useful for better insights into observations of COMs.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first XRISM/Resolve observations of the active galactic nucleus, NGC 1365, obtained in 2024 February and July. NGC 1365 is known for rapid transitions between Compton-thick and Compton-thin states, along with strong absorption from a highly ionized wind. During our observations, the source is found in a persistent low-flux state, characterized by a decrease in hard-X-ray luminosity and significant line-of-sight obscuration. In this state, XRISM/Resolve reveals clear Fe\,\textsc{xxv} and Fe\,\textsc{xxvi} absorption lines together with, for the first time in this source, corresponding emission lines. These features may arise either from reemission from a photoionized wind (P Cygni profile) or from collisionally ionized gas associated with outflow-driven shocks in the interstellar medium. We estimate the wind launch radius to be approximately $10^{16}~\mathrm{cm}$ ($\sim 10^4 R_{\mathrm{g}}$), consistent with the location of the X-ray broad-line region. We also resolve a broadened Fe K$\alpha$ line by $\sigma \sim 1300$ km s$^{-1}$ placing it at similar scales to the wind, consistent with radii inferred from disk-broadening models and the variability of the Fe K$\alpha$ broad line. The similarity of the Fe K$\alpha$ profile to the H$\beta$ wing and broad Pa$\alpha$ width indicates that the X-ray-emitting region is likely cospatial with the optical/IR broad-line region and originates from the same gas.

 - **Abstract**
 Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are common luminous astrophysical transients. SNe Ia serve as distance indicators for measuring the expansion rate of the universe and play important roles in galactic nucleosynthesis. However, ambiguities persist regarding the nature of their stellar progenitors and explosion mechanisms. The recent discovery of \textit{Gaia} hypervelocity white dwarfs (WDs) has provided direct evidence in support of helium-ignited double degenerate SNe Ia. In this study, we investigate the outcomes of helium-ignited double-degenerate WD mergers by performing a set of 3D hydrodynamical simulations with two different codes: \texttt{AREPO} and \texttt{FLASH}. We consider two distinct binary WD systems close to helium ignition, evolving each with both codes while keeping initial conditions fixed. The first binary WD model produces a double detonation of the primary WD and the hypervelocity ejection of the surviving secondary, similar to the canonical dynamically driven double degenerate double detonation (D6) scenario. In the second model, the secondary also undergoes a core detonation, resulting in the complete disruption of both WDs. Notably, despite utilizing distinct numerical solvers, nuclear reaction networks, and mesh strategies, \texttt{AREPO} and \texttt{FLASH} produce broadly consistent outcomes for both sets of initial conditions. While the nucleosynthetic yields differ due to the different nuclear reaction networks employed, the overall agreement between the simulations demonstrates the robustness of the numerical modeling of this scenario. Our results strongly support the viability of both the D6 and quadruple detonation channels for at least some SNe Ia. We explore the prospective observational signatures of this channel, including in the X-rays using \textit{XRISM's} \textit{RESOLVE}.

 - **Abstract**
 We conduct simulations of $\sim$kpc-scale cool clouds in the circumgalactic medium (CGM), using initial conditions sampled from a highly resolved cosmological magneto-hydrodynamical zoom-in of a Milky Way-like galaxy. We select ten distinct cold clouds with masses of $m_{\rm{cloud}}$ $\sim$ $10^{4.5-5}$ M$_\odot$, originally resolved at a mass resolution of $m_{\rm{gas}}$ $\sim$ $200$ M$_\odot$. To further resolve small-scale features and physics, we implement a targeted refinement scheme within spherical regions co-moving with each cloud, thereby boosting the local mass resolution by a factor of 1000, reaching $m_{\rm{gas}}$ $\sim$ $0.2$ M$_\odot$ (spatial resolution, $r_{\rm{gas,cloud}}$ $\sim$ $O(\rm{pc})$). The selected clouds have diverse properties, across a broad parameter space, resulting in heterogeneous evolution. For the clouds we study, radiative cooling is the dominant physical process enabling cloud survival, while magnetic fields play a comparatively smaller role. The motion of these clouds is governed not only by drag forces that decelerate them, but also by acceleration from momentum exchange with the complex background velocity field, which can cause them to move faster than ballistic projectiles set by their initial velocities. Our results suggest that the non-trivial details of realistic cosmological initial conditions -- specifically the complex density, temperature, and velocity fields -- may play an important role in subsequent cloud evolution, and that sampling the output of an existing large-scale simulation provides a self-consistent approach to capture these effects without ad hoc assumptions.

 - **Abstract**
 The Lagrangian Particles (LP) module of the PLUTO code offers a powerful simulation tool to predict the non-thermal emission produced by shock accelerated particles in large-scale relativistic magnetized astrophysics flows. The LPs represent ensembles of relativistic particles with a given energy distribution which is updated by solving the relativistic cosmic ray transport equation. The approach consistently includes the effects of adiabatic expansion, synchrotron and inverse Compton emission. The large scale nature of such systems creates boundless computational demand which can only be satisfied by targeting modern computing hardware such as Graphic Processing Units (GPUs). In this work we presents the GPU-compatible C++ re-design of the LP module, that, by means of the programming model OpenACC and the Message Passing Interface library, is capable of targeting both single commercial GPUs as well as multi-node (pre-)exascale computing facilities. The code has been benchmarked up to 28672 parallel CPUs cores and 1024 parallel GPUs demonstrating $\sim(80-90)\%$ weak scaling parallel efficiency and good strong scaling capabilities. Our results demonstrated a speedup of $6$ times when solving that same benchmark test with 128 full GPU nodes (4GPUs per node) against the same amount of full high-end CPU nodes (112 cores per node). Furthermore, we conducted a code verification by comparing its prediction to corresponding analytical solutions for two test cases. We note that this work is part of broader project that aims at developing gPLUTO, the novel and revised GPU-ready implementation of its legacy.
#### The role of Bethe-Heitler pair production in reconnection-driven flares in M87*

 - **Abstract**
 Rapid TeV flares have been observed from the core of the active galaxy M87. These have been attributed to inverse Compton scattering of disk photons by electrons and positrons accelerated in transient reconnection layers formed in baryon-poor regions of the magnetosphere of the central black hole, M87*. It was previously shown that even a small number of protons accelerated in the same layers can lead to bright GeV proton-synchrotron flares, if protons receive $\gtrsim20\%$ of the dissipated power for reconnecting fields of $\sim$100 G. We aim to investigate the role of Bethe-Heitler pair production in the emission of reconnection-driven flares from M87* in this physical regime. We perform numerical calculations that incorporate inelastic collisions between relativistic protons and photons, as well as photon-photon pair production, and compute the non-thermal radiation from the layer. The numerical calculations are also supported by analytical estimates. We find that disk photons act as targets for Bethe-Heitler pair production. The resulting pairs emit very high-energy synchrotron photons ($\gtrsim$0.1 TeV), which are subsequently attenuated by the disk photon field, leading to further pair production. The synchrotron emission of these secondary pairs produces soft photons, as part of an electromagnetic cascade, enhancing pion production and photon-photon attenuation down to tens-of-GeV energies.

 - **Abstract**
 When two massive stars orbit each other, their winds create a shock cone. In some cases, an evolved, carbon-rich Wolf-Rayet (WR) star's wind collides with that of an orbiting OB star, condensing into dust downstream. This dust is then seen as large spiral structures that eventually move into the interstellar medium. Among these colliding wind binaries, the archetype system WR104 has become an enigma. Aperture masking interferometry with Keck revealed an evolving face-on dust spiral with multiple rungs of dust visible from years of observations. In contrast to direct imagery, recent spectroscopic results implied that the orbit must have an inclination quite different from the face-on geometry. We examined the ASAS and ASAS-SN photometry to put further constraints on the geometry of the orbit. Through a phase-binning of the light curve, we find that the recent g-band light curve is brightest at a time when the OB star is in front of the WR star in our line of sight, with the lowest flux happening at the opposite conjunction. We fit the light curve with an illustrative model for scattering eclipses, which then allows us to infer an inclination of the system of $(41.8^{+13.0}_{-14.9})^\circ$. This inclination agrees with the recent spectroscopic orbit and presents challenges to previous interpretations of high-angular resolution images of the dust plume. We provide a qualitative geometric model for the dust plume to reconcile these results and show how WR104 can provide a means to study the properties of WR dust in detail.

 - **Abstract**
 Using the Spitzer and WISE images, we discovered 42 mid-IR luminous dusty supernovae with local integral-field spectroscopy data. The observed mid-IR emission indicates the presence of newly formed dust, or pre-existing dust heated by the radiation from the supernovae or circumstellar medium interactions. We carried out a systematic analysis of the supernova host environments and their dust properties, for understanding the dust-veiled exploding stars, and whether such an intense dust production process is associated with their local environments. We find that dusty supernovae prefer the locations with higher EW(H{\alpha}), lower metallicity, and heavier host extinctions compared to typical SN types, and they show the same increasing sequence in the values of EW(H{\alpha}) and oxygen abundance from hydrogen-rich, type IIn and hydrogen-poor dusty supernovae. These differences in environmental properties of different dusty SN types indicate the diversity of their progenitors. We also found that one marginal correlation is a negative correlation between the SN dust mass and star formation rate. This means that SNe would be more mid-IR luminous and more dust-rich at the region with lower star formation rate. However, the SN dust mass show no correlation with the metallicity and the host extinction, which were thought to be key factors affecting the mass-loss history of progenitors and the CSM environment of SNe. Therefore, the dust formation process in SNe might be insensitive to metallicity and the dust condition of their host environments.

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar winds interact with the partially ionized interstellar medium (ISM), forming astrospheres. A key feature of this interaction is the hydrogen wall - secondary interstellar atoms produced via charge exchange near the tangential discontinuity separating the stellar wind from the ionized ISM component. This secondary component is decelerated and heated compared to primary interstellar hydrogen, making the hydrogen wall detectable through Lyman-$\alpha$ absorption spectra toward nearby stars. Such structures have been observed by the Hubble Space Telescope around the Sun and other stars. In this paper, we propose that another feature of the stellar wind/partially ionized ISM interaction may also be detectable in Lyman-$\alpha$ spectra: the neutral stellar wind. It forms via charge exchange between supersonic stellar wind protons and interstellar atoms penetrating deep into the astrosphere due to their long mean free paths. We present a parametric numerical analysis of astrospheric structures and their synthetic Lyman-$\alpha$ absorption spectra. Using a 2D kinetic-hydrodynamic model, we vary the terminal wind velocity while maintaining constant dynamic pressure to keep the astrosphere size consistent. For winds slower than the solar wind (terminal velocities $V_0 \lesssim 200$ km/s), charge exchange efficiency in the supersonic region increases dramatically, producing a distinct and observable absorption feature from the neutral wind. This signature is negligible for solar-like winds ($V_0 \approx 400$ km/s) but emerges as a direct spectroscopic diagnostic for winds up to $\sim 200$ km/s. Detecting this neutral wind absorption offers a novel method to directly constrain stellar wind velocities.

 - **Abstract**
 Observations of linear structure connecting pulsars to gamma-ray halos reveal injection of TeV electrons into the interstellar medium (ISM). In some cases, this could be attributed to nearly scattering-free electron transport along large-scale magnetic fields connected to pulsar winds with very slow diffusion across the field lines. In this work we model this process with a magnetic flux tube emerging from the pulsar and attached to the ISM magnetic field. We show that particles in this case have an anisotropic distribution of magnetic pitch angle, such that the overall emission is highly beamed. We apply this model to pulsar tails and filaments, including the extended X-ray and TeV emission associated with PSR J1740+1000 and the misaligned X-ray jet in the Guitar Nebula, to constrain their particle population and magnetic fields.

 - **Abstract**
 The Milky Way's nuclear star cluster (NSC) is a unique laboratory to study the formation and evolution of dense stellar systems around a supermassive black hole. Previous work suggests that most stars in the NSC are old; however, the detailed age and metallicity distributions remain uncertain. We constrain the star formation history (SFH) and metallicity of a poorly explored region located $\sim$3 pc from SagittariusA*. We analyse VLT/NACO imaging in an intermediate-band filter centred at 2.24 $\mu$m, complemented by $H$-band data. We construct completeness-corrected $K$-band luminosity functions (LFs), clearly identifying the Red Clump and Red Giant Branch Bumps. The SFH is derived by fitting cumulative LFs with MIST, PARSEC, and BaSTI models spanning a wide range of ages and metallicities, using Monte Carlo sampling to estimate uncertainties. Metallicity constraints are refined using spectroscopic measurements from the literature. The stellar population is predominantly old and metal-rich: $75.6 \pm 9.5$% of the stellar mass formed $\gtrsim 10$ Gyr ago, with median [M/H] $\sim +0.35$. An intermediate-age component at 2-3 Gyr contributes $20.8 \pm 8.7$%, while minor populations are present at $\sim$400 Myr ($0.9 \pm 0.8$%) and 20 Myr ($3.6 \pm 1.4$%), the latter representing a small but non-negligible young population. Systematic uncertainties from stellar models, binning, photometric range, unresolved binaries, and filter choice are assessed. These results indicate early dominant formation, a significant 2-3 Gyr episode, and minor recent activity, consistent with spectroscopic measurements and with properties of the inner NSC and nuclear stellar disc.
#### First spectroscopic identification of the main sequence in Westerlund 1

 - **Abstract**
 Being the most massive known young stellar cluster in the Milky Way, Westerlund 1 (Wd1) constitutes an ideal benchmark for understanding the evolution of massive stars. However, the cluster age remains highly controversial (~4-10 Myr), hindering the use of Wd1 as a reference for massive star evolution. One of the main issues is high foreground extinction, which has so far prevented the detection of the main sequence. Using infrared spectroscopy we seek to detect the cluster's main sequence for the first time, to characterise the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, and to use the cluster's turn-off to obtain a robust age estimate. We obtained multi-epoch, near-infrared VLT/KMOS spectroscopic observations of Wd1 to map its population of massive stars. The spectra of ~110 members were analysed with CMFGEN models to derive stellar parameters, populate the cluster Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, and compare it with isochrones from evolutionary models. Our observations returned 47 new spectroscopically identified cluster members, with spectral types O9-B1 III-V. The cluster turn-off indicates an age of 5.5+/-1.0 Myr at a distance of 4.23+0.23-0.21 kpc, displaying a moderate degree of coevality. We demonstrate that our estimate of the age of Wd1 is robust against reasonable changes in the distance and extinction law, and the adopted rotational velocity and metallicity of the stellar isochrones. We further find that ~65% of the OB stars with multi-epoch coverage exhibit radial-velocity variability. Infrared observations of the unevolved stellar population support a single episode of star formation with an age of ~5.5 Myr, reinforcing its potential as a benchmark for massive star evolution and providing a reference sample for future binary population studies.

#### Drifters on the edge of town: $λ$ Boötis stars in clusters

 - **Abstract**
 $\lambda$ Boötis stars are a subset of chemically peculiar A-stars that display Solar abundances in lighter elements (C, N, O, S, etc.) but a deficiency in Iron-peak elements. This difference has been attributed to the A-stars accreting pristine (metal deficient) gas from the Interstellar Medium. However, the recent discovery of $\lambda$ Boötis stars in clusters challenges this theory, due to the presence of ionising radiation from intermediate/massive ($>$5 M$_\odot$) stars, which could prevent accretion of pristine ISM gas. We use $N$-body simulations to track the dynamical histories of A-stars during the evolution of a star cluster. We find that some stars leave the confines of the cluster and travel beyond the tidal radius, where they may be able to accrete pristine ISM gas. These A-stars then sometimes move back into the inner regions of the cluster, but the photoionising radiation flux they receive is not high enough to prevent $\lambda$ Boötis abundances from occurring in these A-stars. We find that A-stars can develop $\lambda$ Boötis abundances and subsequently form a wide ($>100$ au) binary system, meaning that observations of binary systems that have different abundances between the component stars would not rule out the ISM accretion scenario. Whilst we have shown that $\lambda$ Boötis stars can reside in and around star clusters, further research is required to assess the validity of the accretion rates required to explain their abundance patterns.

 - **Abstract**
 We present revised stellar ages for 23 pre-main sequence K- and M-type stars in the Upper Scorpius star-forming region, derived by using stellar dynamical masses to constrain isochronal ages from five pre-main sequence stellar evolutionary models. We find that mass-constrained stellar ages for all model sets are more consistent with the older, ~8-11 Myr age for Upper Sco derived using earlier-type stars. Additionally, applying the independent mass constraint to isochronal ages tends to 1) increase stellar ages for most model sets, and 2) decrease age scatter for individual sources between model sets. Models that account for global magnetic fields consistently produce the best match to our observations: they change comparatively little when the mass constraint is applied, and produce 9-10 Myr ages under both unconstrained and mass-constrained conditions. Most standard (nonmagnetic) models produce younger ages (3-5 Myr) when unconstrained, but older ages (6-9 Myr) when constrained by dynamical mass. Our results are consistent with literature findings that suggest median disk lifetimes may be >2x longer than previously thought.
#### Probing Star-Forming Properties via ALMA Observations of Massive Protocluster IRAS 15596-5301

 - **Abstract**
 To deepen our understanding of star-forming properties, we studied a massive protocluster IRAS 15596-5301 using ALMA 870 um and 3 mm data. High-resolution 870 um data reveal 34 dense cores, including 3 hot molecular cores, with subsequent line surveys detecting 22 molecular species toward them. Two velocity components (I15596-red/I15596-blue) were found in the averaged H13CO+(1-0) spectrum, and two filaments were identified from velocity-resolved integrated intensity maps. A spatial overlap between the two filaments was observed, and this overlapping region exhibits a distinct bridge-shaped feature in the position-velocity diagram constructed along the entire filamentary structures. Combined with the reduced H13CO+/HCO+ ratio in the overlapping region and the three-dimensional position-position-velocity cube data, we conclude that a non-head-on collision occurs between the edges of the two filamentary structures in IRAS 15596-5301. Cluster analysis demonstrates that clusters located in the collision region host more evolved chemical rich dense cores than their counterparts in other regions. Our results thus indicate that star formation in I15596 is triggered or accelerated by a mild non-head-on collision between two filaments.
#### Distinguishing the nature of dark matter by mapping cosmic filaments from Lyman-alpha emission

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.22677

 - **Abstract**
 The standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model predicts that cosmic filaments are highly clumpy, whereas warm dark matter -- invoked to address small-scale challenges in $\Lambda$CDM -- produces filaments that are noticeably smoother and less structured. In this work, we investigate the potential of Lyman $\alpha$ (Ly$\alpha$) emission to trace cosmic filaments at redshifts $z=2.5$ and $z=4$, and assess their potential for constraining the nature of dark matter. Our analysis shows that Ly$\alpha$ filaments provide a promising observational probe of dark matter: at $z=4$, differences in filament smoothness and surface brightness serve as distinctive signatures between models. Looking ahead, the upcoming generation of 30-meter class telescopes will be critical for enabling these measurements, offering a compelling opportunity to distinguish the nature of dark matter by mapping the structure of cosmic filaments.

 - **Abstract**
 This study focuses on forecasting major (>=M-class) solar flares that can severely impact the near-Earth environment. We construct two types of datasets using the Space Weather HMI Active Region Patches (SHARP), and develop a flare prediction network based on large language model (LLMFlareNet). We apply SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to explain the model predictions. We develop an operational forecasting system based on the LLMFlareNet model. We adopt a daily mode for performance comparison across various operational forecasting systems under identical active region (AR) number and prediction date, using daily operational observational data. The main results are as follows. (1) Through ablation experiments and comparison with baseline models, LLMFlareNet achieves the best TSS scores of 0.720 +/- 0.040 on the ten cross-validation (CV) dataset with mixed ARs. (2) By both global and local SHAP analyses, we identify that R_VALUE is the most influential physical feature for the prediction of LLMFlareNet, aligning with flare magnetic reconnection theory. (3) In daily mode, LLMFlareNet achieves TSS scores of 0.680/0.571 (0.689/0.661, respectively) on the dataset with single/mixed ARs, markedly outperforming NASA/CCMC (SolarFlareNet, respectively). This work introduces the first application of a large language model as a universal computation engine with explainability method in this domain, and presents the first comparison between operational flare forecasting systems in daily mode. The proposed LLMFlareNet-based system demonstrates substantial improvements over existing systems.
#### Rotational Spectroscopy as a Tool to Study Vibration-Rotation Interaction: Investigations of $^{13}$CH$_3$CN and CH$_3$$^{13}$CN up to $v_8 = 2$ and a Search for $v_8 = 2$ Transitions toward Sagittarius B2(N)

 - **Abstract**
 Methyl cyanide, CH$_3$CN, is present in diverse regions in space, in particular in the warm parts of star-forming regions where it is a common molecule. Rotational transitions of $^{13}$CH$_3$CN and CH$_3$$^{13}$CN in their $v_8 = 1$ lowest excited vibrational states ($E_{\rm vib} \approx 520$ K) are quite prominent in Sagittarius B2(N). In order to be able to search for transitions of the next higher vibrational state $v_8 = 2$, we recorded spectra of samples enriched in $^{13}$CH$_3$CN and CH$_3$$^{13}$CN up to $v_8 = 2$ in the 35 to 1091~GHz region and reinvestigated existing spectra of CH$_3$CN in its natural isotopic composition between 1085 and 1200 GHz. Perturbations caused by near-degeneracies in $K = 4$ of $v_8 = 2^0$ and $K = 2$ of $v_8 = 2^{-2}$ yielded accurate information on the energy spacing of 22.93 and 21.79 cm$^{-1}$ between the $l$-components of $^{13}$CH$_3$CN and CH$_3$$^{13}$CN, respectively. Fermi-type interaction between $K = 13$ and 14 of $v_8 = 1^{-1}$ and $v_8 = 2^{+2}$ probe the energy differences between the two states of both isotopomers. In addition, a $\Delta K \pm2$, $\Delta l \mp1$ interaction between the ground vibrational state of $^{13}$CH$_3$CN and $v_8 = 1^{+1}$ provides information on their energy spacing. Furthermore, we obtained improved or extended ground state rotational transition frequencies of $^{13}$CH$_3$$^{13}$CN and extensive data for $^{13}$CH$_3$C$^{15}$N and CH$_3$$^{13}$C$^{15}$N. Finally, we report the results of our search for transitions of $^{13}$CH$_3$CN and CH$_3$$^{13}$CN in their $v_8 = 2$ states toward Sagittarius B2(N).

 - **Abstract**
 Small polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and somewhat larger cyano derivatives were detected in the cold dark cloud TMC-1 recently. Their formation from smaller hydrocarbons is not well understood, in part because abundances of many species are not known. Methylallene, CH$_3$CHCCH$_2$, may be one of the building blocks, but its rotational spectrum was characterized only to a very limited extent. We recorded rotational transitions in the 36$-$501 GHz region to extend the existing line list of methylallene and thus enable searches for the molecule in space. Quantum-chemical calculations were carried out to evaluate initial spectroscopic parameters. We obtained transition frequencies with $J \le 61$ and $K_a \le 21$ and resolved the internal rotation splitting of the CH$_3$ group at least partially. As a result, a full set of distortion parameters up to sixth order along with two octic ones were determined, as well as parameters describing the internal rotation of the methyl group. The spectroscopic parameters are accurate enough to identify methylallene up to 720 GHz, sufficient for searches even in the warm interstellar medium.

 - **Abstract**
 We present long-slit near-infrared spectroscopic observations of six nearby (z$\sim$0.1) radio-quiet type-2 quasars (QSO2s) from the Quasar Feedback (QSOFEED) sample. They have bolometric luminosities of $10^{45-46}~erg~s^{-1}$ and stellar masses of $ 10^{10.6-11.3}~M_{\odot}$. The observations were obtained with the instrument Espectrógrafo Multiobjeto Infra-Rojo (EMIR) on the 10.4 m Gran Telescopio Canarias. The nuclear K-band spectra (central $\sim$1-3 kpc of the QSO2s) reveal signatures of high-velocity outflows in either the Pa$\alpha$ or Br$\gamma$ lines, depending on the redshift, and in the [Si VI] lines. The broadest kinematic components have full width at half maximum (FWHM) of $\sim$1200-2500 km $s^{-1}$. From the near-infrared hydrogen recombination lines we derived ionized outflow masses of $M_{Hion} \sim0.08-20\times 10^{6}~M_{\odot}$, mass outflow rates of $\dot{M}_{Hion}\sim0.03-6~M_{\odot}~yr^{-1}$, and kinetic powers of $\dot{E}_{Hion}\sim 10^{37.8-40.8}~erg~s^{-1}$. These ionized gas outflow masses and mass outflow rates have median values that are 5.9 and 5.8 times larger, respectively, than those derived from the [Si VI] line. Our study provides evidence, at least for these six QSO2s, that the near-infrared recombination lines and [Si VI] are tracing the same outflow (i.e., they have similar kinematics and radii), but they carry different amounts of mass. We detected warm molecular lines in the six QSO2s, from which we measured total (nuclear) gas masses from 1.1 (0.7) to 32 (13) $\times~10^3~M_{\odot}$, similar to other QSO2s with warm $H_2$ measurements reported in the literature, but we did not find any molecular outflow associated with them. Comparing with other five QSO2s with $H_2$ measurements reported in the literature, we find that the four QSO2s with detected $H_2$ outflows have total (nuclear) $H_2$ masses 2.2 (2.7) times larger, on average.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first detailed multi-tracer observation of a 5-pc long outer Galaxy filament, G183, and the massive young stellar object (YSO) IRAS 05480+2545 associated with it. Using the IRAM 30-m telescope at lambda = 1.4 and 3 mm, we probed the molecular gas distribution at angular resolutions of ~12"-28" (0.1-0.3 pc at d = 2.1 kpc). The velocity-resolved C18O(1-0) observations conclusively show a main filament with a skeleton of ridges. The main filament is a 5 pc long velocity-coherent structure with a continuous and quiescent velocity field along its length up to the star-forming hub that accretes mass from the filament. The internal gas kinematics of most of the G183 filament is dominated by thermal motions (sigma_NT/cs~1) and large-scale velocity gradients arising due to outflows and accretion of matter in the massive YSO. The dispersion-size relation almost up to 1 pc is consistent with Larson's law, suggesting that the origin of the filament is a turbulence cascade. The massive YSO, S1, with no corresponding radio continuum detection is characterized as a high-mass protostellar object with a mass of 156 Msun and an M/L ratio of 0.04. We identify a kinematic signature of the accretion of material from the filament onto the YSO, S1. The rates of molecular gas accretion and entrainment in S1 are estimated to be 8.6 and 2.6 (in units of 10^-4 Msun/yr), respectively. In comparison to the inner Galaxy high-mass star-forming filaments forming massive stars, G183 has a lower column density; however, the accretion and outflow rates in S1 are similar. The detection of hydrocarbons such as CH3CN and HC3N indicates the presence of hot-core chemistry in S1. These results highlight the universality of physical processes involved in massive star formation across a range of Galactic environments.
#### Sunspot simulations with MURaM -- I. Parameter study using potential field initial conditions

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Existing sunspot simulations fail to reproduce the observed magnetic field distribution due to an artificially increased $B_{hor}$ at the upper boundary. Aims. We explore alternative ways to better reproduce the magnetic and dynamic properties of observed sunspots. Methods. We use the radiative MHD code MURaM. As initial conditions, we placed a potential magnetic field into small-scale dynamo simulations and used potential-field extrapolation at the top. Results. We find that: (1) Simulations with increasing initial magnetic field strengths (20, 40, 80, and 160 kG) show larger spots, umbrae, and penumbrae. (2) The penumbral-to-spot sizes are smaller than those measured in observed sunspots. (3) In none of the runs are pure Evershed (radially outward) flows. Instead, bi-directional flows with inflows in the inner penumbra and outflows in the outer penumbra were measured, similar to early observations of penumbra formation for runs with $\ge80$ kG at 96/32 km resolution, whereas runs with 40 kG or less showed pure inflows. (4) Simulations with 160 kG at 32/16 km resolution contain filaments with bi-directional and Evershed flows. (5) Simulations with fluxes $>10^{22}$ Mx show unrealistically strong fields in the umbra. (6) The best runs with 160 kG and $10^{22}$ Mx give realistic radial profiles of $B_z$ and $B_r$, although stronger fields than observed. (7) Increasing the width of the box and reducing the overall flux by subtracting a uniform opposing vertical field have little influence on internal spot dynamics and fields, but change the mean vertical field outside the spot. Conclusions. Simulations of small ($10^{22}$) sunspots with an initial potential field and intensified bottom magnetic field strength best reproduce observations of the initial stages of sunspot formation. Numerical resolution may be critical for achieving fully developed penumbrae.
#### PDRs4All: XVIII. The evolution of the PAH ionisation and PAH size distribution across the Orion Bar

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the evolution of the PAH population's charge state and size across key physical zones in the Orion Bar, which include the HII region, the atomic PDR (APDR), and three HI/H2 dissociation fronts (DF1, DF2, and DF3). Utilising the NASA Ames PAH Infrared Spectroscopic Database (PAHdb) and the pyPAHdb spectral modelling tool, we analysed the MIRI-MRS observations of the Orion Bar from the "PDRs4All" ERS Program. pyPAHdb modelling reveals the fractional contribution of the different PAH charge states and sizes to the total PAH emission across the Orion Bar. Cationic PAH emission peaks in the APDR region, where neutral PAHs have minimal contribution. Emission from neutral PAHs peaks in the HII region that consists of emission from a face-on PDR associated to the background OMC-1 molecular cloud, and in the molecular cloud regions past DF2. PAH anions are observed deep within the DF2 and DF3 zones. The average PAH size ranges between ~$60-74$ Nc. The modelling reveals regions of top-down PAH formation at the ionisation front, and bottom-up PAH formation within the molecular cloud region. The PAH ionisation parameter $\gamma$ ranges between ~$2-9 x 10^4$. Intensity ratios tracing PAH ionisation scale well with $\gamma$ in regions encompassing edge-on or face-on PDR emission, but their correlation weakens within the molecular cloud zone. Modelling of the $5-15$ $\mu$m PAH spectrum with pyPAHdb achieves comprehensive characterization of the net contribution of neutral and cationic PAHs across different environments, whereas empirical PAH proxy intensity ratio tracers can be highly variable and unreliable outside regions dominated by PDR emission. The derived average PAH size in the different physical zones is consistent with a view of PAHs being more extensively subjected to ultraviolet processing closer to the ionisation front, and less affected within the molecular cloud.
